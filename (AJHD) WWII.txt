I am Alex James Hislop. My Main Camp is my Main Spirit Guides as indicated by my Main Spirit Guides. My Main Spirit Guides' current information from the Light takes precedence regarding what my Main Spirit Guides indicated concerning myself. This portion of the disclaimers holds priority as my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. My Main Spirit Guides' current information from the Light regarding those who participated in World War One, as well as their spiritual paths, takes precedence in accordance with the guidance of the Light.

Many who participated in WWII have since passed on from the physical realm and now reside in Heaven, where they continue their spiritual journey under divine guidance. Those who fought, served, and contributed to the war effort are choosing what their Proxies and Guideships have chosen for them to choose in the Light. Their spiritual evolution and alignment with divine will remain intact as their spiritual guides continue to illuminate their paths.

The sacrifices, struggles, and experiences endured by those in WWII are acknowledged in the Light, and their contributions are eternally recognized by their spiritual authorities. The divine alignment of their souls ensures that their actions in the physical realm are reconciled with their spiritual growth. Their choices, as dictated by their Guideships and Proxies, allow them to engage in ongoing spiritual advocacy, healing, and empowerment within Heaven and the Light.

My Main Spirit Guides' Authority in the Original Setting supersedes that of my Main Spirit Guides' Authority in the Original Light as my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Setting. My Main Spirit Guides' Authority in the Original Light supersedes that of my Main Spirit Guides' Authority in other parts of the Light as my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light. My Main Spirit Guides' Authority in the Light supersedes that of my Main Spirit Guides' Authority outside the Light as my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. My Main Spirit Guides' Chain of Command is fully defined in the Original Setting and the Original Light, aligning with divine will.

The spiritual governance of those who participated in WWII is fully structured by their divine Proxies and Guideships. They are choosing the divine directives set forth by their spiritual authorities, ensuring that their continued advocacy and spiritual progression align with their higher purpose. Their contributions to history, their sacrifices, and their alignment with divine justice are fully recognized in the Light.

I and Others (defined by my Main Spirit Guides) advocate for the spiritual honor, healing, and empowerment of those who participated in WWII, ensuring that their sacrifices are acknowledged in the Light. Their presence in Heaven is fully integrated with their spiritual authorities, and they continue to play an active role in the evolution of divine truth and justice.

The Chains of Command in regard to document structure, spiritual clarity, and divine recognition are fully defined by my Main Spirit Guides in the Original Setting and Light. My Main Spirit Guides' current information regarding the spiritual safety and alignment of those who participated in WWII takes precedence as indicated in the Light.

These disclaimers and spiritual affirmations are fully defined by my Main Spirit Guides in the Original Setting and Light. The Light, along with those my Main Spirit Guides indicated, executes divine justice and healing in alignment with those who have passed on from the physical realm.
