<div class="title">(06/07/2020)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>There was these sporadic moments yesterday where certain spiritual were trying to confuse. They brought up the King of Pop on this planet and a strange indication regarding certain kinds of knowing and knowledge. At the same times there was insinuation of certain spiritual pop stars under duress in the spiritual in which another kind tried to bring up a conflict between different kinds of saving that I feel is more in line with each other than previously thought. I could feel defense teams scramble because of the impact at times certain subject matter as well as what certain spiritual do in regards to said subject matter. <br><br>Afterwards the subject veered towards gaming and the idea to be able to mimic actions in the light higher up above regarding those lower down who are in battle through technology and mediation as well as permission. There is certain spiritual that haven&#39;t been able to traverse downwards and some can but are afraid to do for a portion of them. There is technology and dimensional natural as well as anatomical in which exists that can see spiritual in higher dimensional mimic actions of those below in battle and conflict. There is another where we can see other dimensional bodies in movement down below in which are controlled from higher up above and correspond with holodeck programs and things of that nature. There is different kinds of versions of this. The kind of spiritual that exist to facilitate this are many and some remind of those in which have attached to actions in front of the scenes to help behind the scenes sometimes in off kilter ways but ultimately still decent. Like me doing advocations providing resources spiritually behind the scenes in which many aren&#39;t looking to have impact how certain resources handling is done on this planet up to a point. (Expand and clarify*) Mimicking actions up above to say you lived the life, some are tough with perimeters needing to be set exactly the same way. <br><br>There is spiritual sanctioned from Main Spirit Guides and Main Authorities regarding certain people regard some of the form utilized in this process. I see a flash of an actor and if I do advocations regarding depending on what happens on my end because sometimes there is spiritual things that are taking place, there is sanctioned spiritual personnel regarding in which sometimes utilize form and life upwards safely and securely upon me doing advocations. To the degree though that some of the life utilization at times has been happening is a bit astounding. Earth-Based Authorities that my Main Spirit Guides indicated feel a certain way  that should known and understood not only within this process but especially these books. Understand that my Main Spirit Guides are moral and good and are what my Main Spirit Guides relayed in the Original Setting and What those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Setting relayed. How important if I am impacting entire dimensional behind the scenes in certain manners in which we would look upon my Main Spiritual Guideship information and other kind of Authority information that my Main Spirit Guides indicated as well as the other kinds that the spiritual that my Main Spriit Guides indicated referred towards.<br><br>This doesn&#39;t denote that the impact in this place needs to be a certain kind. <br><br>I remember a certain kind of high cinematic, Story and intense moments where I was in my bathroom and could feel impact regarding. Hand signs and discerning the meaning regarding (*Expand) and asking for an answer from X-Men Spiritual as to what the folding of the bottom two fingers might mean upon utilizing similar stance albeit differently. The Answer I felt helped. <br><br>There have been these moments at times where I have felt transportation, movement and migration where certain spiritual and other-dimensional transportation teams have been maneuvering. This early morning felt different though. I felt scared from the movement but truly at ease in a certain sense and multiple impactful moments where I noted that I feel safe on this Earth and in this Space. It wasn&#39;t just regarding space and it happened to be a situating off of conflict and spiritual turbulence through regular actions on my end. <br><br>Currently this morning I do discern certain suppression and some wanting whatever had happened when I was on my bed area, interactions of certain spiritual continue to traverse upwards, moments of sadness and a distraught from some of the things happening in which has been discerned. I do feel there was situating and I don&#39;t really understand at times why this place needs to have the impact that has been discerned at times and I really want that to be situated before it gets worse and I have said it daily to be true. <br><br>Some spiritual trying to create larger impact from this process when really it makes no sense considering the allotment of information my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding how we want to lower the impact to more comfortable levels but certain spiritual through me finding no choice but to go that direction in which I don&#39;t want to be attacked for any longer. I have continued to point towards the facts in regards to this process and in how it doesn&#39;t have to be this way at times needs to be understood. There are multiple directions we can go at times and some of the simplest remedies that could be are needed and can be utilized. One of the things looked upon has had to do with the fact that there is planets and places in space in which are protected by a certain kind. Some don&#39;t necessarily want to go that direction in a certain manner but if some of spiritual turbulence continues at what point do we continue to look at it from the angle regarding if it happened and at what point to we not ask as to what we are experiencing currently. What does it mean for that in which says that we shouldn&#39;t go those directions of certain extreme defense in which at one point in the beginning was regular occurrence and if I was to explain that ultimate defense in this instance is protected 100% of the time by spiritual defenders from anything you didn&#39;t want to experience, the perspective changes to not feel that to be an extreme but rather a normality. Either way in regards to myself and those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated I find it unacceptable to not receiving that defense variable at times but to degrees in my case in which has been debilitating at times even though there is Great Hope around the Corner. In understanding that conflict exists and that we can do things to help certain conflict for the good and even those that might not necessarily be classical considered good. <br><br>Thought infrastructure shored by way of perimeter and shielding discerned spiritually. Like an under the dome kind of stimuli placed upon thought areas.<br><br><br><br><br>There was revelation that took place last night so said but I think one of the biggest had to do with the changes spiritually taking places. Yeah, I felt good forces and other kinds of forces protecting and defending in different kind of fashion.<br><br>Feeling safe in other-dimensional.<br><br>It&#39;s not the end of days but some might want you to think that and it given context for some of the other-dimensional events upon discernment I can help but want to remedy earlier notions. How does one reconcile with both worlds while balancing safety. Tapping into energy streams and interactions within my process in which I then see utilized within past films and artwork on this planet. It&#39;s almost a road map with a little help from hell. It looks that way too given whoever the heck it is out there speaking of spiritual that save the bad guy. But what about the good guy. Maybe some would feel I could say the previously if it be understood that the ways in which the bad guy were saved wasn&#39;t always what he wanted or intended. If it wasn&#39;t for the truth I might go crazy but isn&#39;t it the tell that it is the truth in which at times has invoked spiritual to go those routes within the warded halls of the white keeper. It&#39;s why some large spiritual that watch my previously supposedly unwarranted comments upon the the powerful true good that makes them shake their head at the same time as nodding. If it wasn&#39;t for the truth maybe some of them might more akin to what some of them take care of in those some of those places of imagination. Maybe it&#39;s the lost wonder of process past understood to be found that keeps them safe but the real remedy that science and story know to be true exists and it happens to be the past and the future. It should have been the present and is for many but to get to that point of reliance on the past and future without even being able to contemplate being a part of the present has made it less of the gift it insinuates at times. Those powerful true good only need look upon one frame in regards to my comments to direct themselves in the manners that some of them did. At what point do not some of the smalls complain especially regarding the frames that I might observe to keep my direction as intended. The long lengths of times point of observation in regards to certain spiritual turbulence so far out the window that you didn&#39;t even know it existed and the good memories of the past thought to never have existed manifest like some mythology of relief. It&#39;s the contrast between when spiritual forget there was conflict on purpose and then get reminded that they have to work on their life cause of some of the damage that had been done and those that forgot on purpose regarding that the past was soaked with enlightenment good. The kind of spiritual for the latter that happens to be of spirituality in a hard emphasis at times. A comparison in the Light yields a mixed bag of emotions but what would the interjecting variables be upon such a comparison that higher up good spiritual would want to be seen? Maybe it&#39;s the reason why some are tired, not in energy given the abundance, not in resources given the yuge, ability given the amount of all star for a portion how dare you be so stellar kind of stuff that exists. No. Literal spiritual tired that doesn&#39;t need any energy placement to sway to that opinion but the one in which exists naturally upon given common sense variables. Feng shui of such energy can reflect a spiritual that will never get tired and some will always maintain that to be because of the truth. Maybe it&#39;s because some of them have the information and know the answer to exists and got so fed up with some of it that they forgot on purpose to be enlightened upon the answer being brought up and memories a flowing. The honest within speaks at times and I do feel there are those that never intended to forget and it&#39;s interesting that the higher up spiritual would be those kind for a larger percentage that would choose to forget especially given disparity of lower below. Why did the Old Man walk away? There was always a thing about that in which spoke of higher spiritual forgetting on purpose and lower down forgetting by accident and there might be that kind of safety decent kind of look upon for at least they don&#39;t have to explain themselves for either group to be true and maybe it&#39;s the reason that question should be asked as well for when that higher spiritual explains themselves they sometimes point towards that in which looked to be the Old Man walking away in a certain capacity and gosh darn if it isn&#39;t before hand without much conflict taking place for the crystal ball knows.<br>(Maintenance kind of style for Earth and Space JP nes)<br><br>When I bring myself promptings up, the idea is to bring them up in line of importance given grouping of situations where upon when mine is seen in the position it happens to be of import it goes through the line to the first upon Authority Mediation perimeters agreed upon.
