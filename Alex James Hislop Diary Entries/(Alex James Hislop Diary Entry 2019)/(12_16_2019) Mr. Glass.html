<div class="title">(12/16/2019) Mr. Glass</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Some of the things I see within movies scare me. There is a reality in regards to some of the films we watch and when we watch them we sometimes lent power to some of that reality. We watch movies as they are real at times and I have noticed moments where the safeguards pertaining have let know that they are around. But I still wonder. The experiences I have had have let me know of a darker kind. Something darker than darkness. It&#39;s the dark of blue. The ones that are good, the ones that are your friends and when I let know there is family in regards to some of us that operate in such manner in not to scare or upset but rather speak truth on a subject that some would rather not accept and have difficult time accepting. That there are those in the light that don&#39;t even know about this kind. Don&#39;t mistaken this for some of the true good that do know and some of the good that do understand, for they are many. It&#39;s the ones that are suppose to protect us and keep us safe that have a dark side to them that frighten me in the night. They wouldn&#39;t be able to scare me more than the darkness that they battle and ally with at times but they do a decent job enough and somehow they do achieve the menace they both dislike and love. The storylines portrayed in films at times have been such that if to be true reality would the terror in films that truly exists. A Nightmare that can be emulated with exact precision that is missing the variable that some say is one of the greatest most important points in history. It&#39;s the same one that other point towards on the other side and agree at times in different ways. What we experience matters, it&#39;s this, imagine you get lost in area where there is certain kind that could attack at any moment and the fear is on you like the dark of night and what if another person experiences that same thing? How you view it and how you view it in the light might be more similar than you think specifically if you ask your perspective in the Light but it can only go so far. Why is that? Because what you experience matters to you at times and it&#39;s that same it only goes so far that some spirits understand in what others experience. The same love and care, the same self preservation that you feel for yourself certain spirit feel for each other. You have this same creed instilled in you spiritually for certain spirit and it never used to be certain spirit. It used to be all but because the times we live in has dictated for some that that creed is only in regards to their own. In how you view those moments later on can be desensitized but you remember and down here you might not fully understand but when you get to a place where you do you will know what I speak where you can look at the memory in crystal it&#39;s the line that somehow says what others are experiencing is not what we are experiencing in a certain manner in which is correct in a certain degree but also incorrect in another. Imagine that God experiences portions of our life and imagine there i an aspect of God that experiences some of the negative to comfort. There are Spirit that experience portions of our life and it&#39;s not just God but there are also collectives of Spirit that experience peoples lives given consent for some. Life tracks and the concept regarding has been spoken about to a certain  degree. Life itself in regards to certain dimensional existences being a track. What does the pointer represent? To each own does it represent each life being lived and the live being experienced? The present moment? One Song. Outro. Except there are many different dimensional life tracks that exist. The flip side of that song, flipping the record over, does it get played once? Or many more times. <br>Lately I have noted there is many talking about some of the impact that we this group of spirit and generation that my Main Spriit Guides indicated have. They have looked at me specifically in regards to being one of the in front of the scenes dimensionals somewhat in the room. The affect I have on people and the affect that it shouldn&#39;t be. Lives changes and shaping taking place in which has been not what I have been intending while still trying to keep the balance between those ho are trying to help and survive. Don&#39;t mistaken because I have gone with the artist&#39;s vision that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. A lot of it has revolved around content to a certain extent. I will see the impact at times my own life has through certain content in which a large portion I feel of the power itself has gone into the Artist&#39;s vision that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. The power of the Artist&#39;s Vision is there, we have to remember the power of experiences and the power of creation and construction. It lends towards a movie sometimes just as lack of power sometimes does as well. One of the things I brought up is projects where peoples can utilize to interject certain things obviously still in regards to an artist&#39;s vision for a decent sized portion. I am talking multiple kinds of content. Is there not an allocation of films, series, music, books, comics,  pornography, games and Art where there can be an honest outlet to be able to embed certain defensives informational placement and other kinds. Would it not safeguards the artist&#39;s vision of certain content? Would it not create an outlet for those that need that such an avenue? The conversation of such that talks about portions of content being affected rather than entire content. Does this have to do with needing to speak? Does this have to do with them? I am talking A list stuff too and there are a decent portion that had that in mind when talking about this discussion. Is there films out there that when we watch them that consist of the entirety of a certain kind in which speaks more of letting know, informing and defense work and that can be said as to why certain Artist&#39;s vision do not need to be altered or affected in manners in which the Artist disagreed with. What if we talk about a specific point. We know immorality culture to exist. What do some say in regards to similar ideas in regards to certain kinds of immorality depictions that my Main Spirit Guides indicated being interjected in content? Light, display clarifications in regards to this paragraph the way my Main Spriit Guides indicated. <br><br><br>-(Watched another film in the unbreakable series. And it felt like I could discern some of the events in regards to the film itself at least some of the spiritual portions. They tried insinuating that it was a pinnacle and some of the happenings having to do withe darkness and those that are of good and bad especially in the some of the events depicted on my end through the film has something to do with why I am being attacked, that I defended myself in a certain manner and it was because of quality of life and defense. In regards to safety and how I don&#39;t sometimes compromise for some of it is sometimes misconstrued. I do compromise at times but in a certain fashion on certain topics. When I get attacked I defend myself.) <br>-(Another topic point had to do with Art and that paintings and Artwork in which when referring to art through Film, Acting, Theatre and even gaming that there is a purity of Art in regards to paintings and artwork that deserves resources. It was also thought of that Art in many forms is one of the reasoning as to why I feel the way I do in being able to create Art but also in being able to experience.That there is ways to experience art without over creating and without being underwhelmed in not being able to experience art)<br><br>-(Why did I come down here if everything was going to be ok? Did you ever think that my Psychictivity was a safeguard. That if I became psychic especially in how it happened and how they maneuver my psychictivty, that it told of something taking place. When I asked if I had been forced to come here or under circumstances not kosher or fully detailed, some spirit said that either it was going to be ok without me or that I would be needed. Considering my defense it went to that sort of thing where it looked to be less of me and more to do with something else. What is that something else? Events taking place? Someone would have went a certain direction if I had not been born? Like we would have been potentially better off? How have they utilized the physical on this planet in the past? When these events took place and I am not here what does it look like? Would these events have taken place in certain areas had I not been here? Continued advocations to be placed where my Main Spriit Guides indicated makes it interesting. So either I chose to come down here under false pretenses or I was needed and maybe I did choose regardless to come down here but does that fall in line with the storylne that I haven&#39;t been helping? Or does it speak of the one that really was helping being labelled that he he didn&#39;t help?
