<div class="title">(05/25/2019) &quot;To those that take the Hit&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I have discerned an Early Morning gambit take place as I have understood different spirits to exist. Those that can exist in regards to ourselves in which some may view as certain dimensional existences whether combined with the physical or not in which some may have come to view a certain way. Cultures and banners as well as dimensions on which some can compose of our own dimensional anatomy at times in which make us feel certain kinds at times. As a psychic I have become able to discern when some of the layers of myself are combined in certain areas. Where I can feel myself heal in a mentality and sight sort of way pertaining to sleep by way of certain technology affecting my health potentially in decent ways. Some of those layer affected by sleep, water, food and other kinds in which there is potentially tech and magic to facilitate health behind the scenes. Why some of that stuff isn&#39;t employed more than it is seems a mystery to me. <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(THOSE MONITORING SPIRITUAL EVENTS THROUGH THESE WRITINGS)<br> Those monitoring the conflict and spiritual atmospherics through my writings, be careful in both ways. there are many psychics that experience positivity and decent things in many different ways. One of the tactics is to say that physical earth based psychic were potentially lying when some of them didn&#39;t fully know to write down some of the spiritual events that happened within their lives, it doesn&#39;t mean they were lying, it just means that there are times when people don&#39;t write certain things down and the kinds of positivity that does exist is a great amount, on the same sort of line in regards to tactic some have been trying to make others think that certain events are more blown out of proportion than they but are also trying to mask that there are events taking place. Puzzle pieces was one of the things this month but it is scary to think that there could be worse battle out there in which I feel exists . how can you blame those for trying to let know especially when they have to work with the hookups of having to do it without consent and in erratic ways. So the who wants to know the truth about the wars and in what way? because I do feel like there are some in which if it hits a certain kind or threshold that they then do certain things by ways of information being found out, i understanding this is specific to certain dimensional thresholds but not all, those ones in which it isn&#39;t working this way, is there warfare? Is their new warfare in regards to the past 2 - 3 years in regards to some of the events listed in my writings in regards to the Multidimensional communities that my Main Camp indicated but There is events taking place, I have felt earth base be attacked in certain manners, there changes happening, but there is also a myriad of different positive events, some of which have happened to me in multiple kinds of ways and I have been trying to let know how I don&#39;t want to negatively impact the spiritualist communities. <br><br>I am Alex James Hislop.
