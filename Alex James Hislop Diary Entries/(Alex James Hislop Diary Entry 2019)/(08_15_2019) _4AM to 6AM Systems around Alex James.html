<div class="title">(08/15/2019) &quot;4AM to 6AM Systems around Alex James Hislop&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- There is a subject that has been talked about. Being brought up to a certain degree but I see certain shaping of behavior, personality and physical look as well as other kinds supposedly from my interaction and impact as well as in regards to my process. Multiple stars having qualities to certain people within my life, notably some of my cousins and a few key friends. In regards to my friends there is a big red flag in regards to this physical life. I don&#39;t have many, I haven&#39;t hung out with them often and I don&#39;t know if some of them consider me friends in this physical as Alex James Hislop Fenbo44 at least in a certain context. Spiritually speaking it might be a different story partially by way of the circumstances that have happened but their is nothing wrong with being and hanging out and I don&#39;t think it deserves to get attacked over. There has been a mixing of personal and business to a certain degree and that lense doesn&#39;t feel it warrants to take such blunt action and head on looks in regards to this process at times for reasonings that are apparent. For example one of my family members might look like certain famous but it&#39;s also an archetype that I can discern. Certain qualities that I realize there might be another both potentially famous and joes as well as other kinds, potentially someone in a certain spot where certain kind would look towards and say hey, there is a percentage of earth based shaped in multiple manners off of this archetype in which might makes sense that I would have a family member in regards potentially on their end. The thing of it is though is that there are also other kind of archetypes and some wonder about the rich and famous as well as other kinds in that if someone said there would be a smaller archetypes of some of those previous kinds of archetypes existing in a certain context, even just asking a regular person in a certain manner given certain knowledge that I have explained would garner a response that says it might not be too outlandish for something like that to exist. There is the idea though that because of my process and impact that some of my friends and family at times have been impacting certain processes and the way it&#39;s labelle on my end is that is the case in a certain manner rather than <br>- The idea that some of my advocations are only pertaining to video game existences in which is not to be mistaken partially by way of how I do my advocations. We looked at something a putting aside the amount of interaction i get mixed in with at times and the amount of damage and harm that has supposedly happened to me and others in certain spiritual and we look towards this notion that if I was just not talking and doing certain addvocations that things would be ok. We move past conversations, argumentatives and other kind of that nature because it&#39;s warranted not only because I am in the privacy of my own home but because I continue to advocate to be placed where my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light and yeah, some of it has to do with being placed in areas where I can still make a difference and still help out especially considering I still do adovcationals and things of that nature not to upset the point that shouldn&#39;t or affect to such degrees as it has but also the spiritual points that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this writing. We move past and say hey, it only pertains to what my main Spirit Guides indicated and this isn&#39;t just in regards to myself but also those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Which means that there could be months where my advocations only pertain to certain gaming existences and some of which might be personal games that I and others that my main Spirit Guides created in the Original Light.   <br><br>The context in regards to how I operate, I go to the physical perspectives that my main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to Earth-Based and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and I ask what you identify with in regards to perspectives pertaining to other selves in the context that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in which for me in regards to who I consider someone to be is cross referenced with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>Disparities in regards to looking past perspectives, and the utilization in regards to myself of looking past certain areas because I am in the room per say and in the mix per say but really it might not be in such a way as to be able to make that path viable at least not in explaining in certain areas. <br><br>My Main Spirit Guides would have given me certain baseline information anyhow in a certain context probably right on the money of some saying that it would be too much in certain instances especially in regards to some of the issues having to do with the hurt and harm as well as immorality promotion and morality promotion that my Main Spirit Guides indicated as trades. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) adhere to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>Advocationals:<br>Defense Teams Rights, Coherency, Circumstances, Situations Conflicts.<br>- Cover with emphasis in regards to Main Spirit Guides and Proxies as well as authorities understood with revealing with out problems and e<br>Viewpoint compared to others cross referencing comparing<br>algorithms and routines for the light, augmentation and <br>systems check as well as routines, Diagnostics and further advocationnals as in regards to Light tethering actions to my Actions, non-actions, etc.(defined by my Main Camp)<br>emphasis in regards to who is not suppose to be in my advocations as alex james hislop and others(defined by my Main Camp)<br>What exactly is currently taking place in regards to Alex James Hislop and others(defined by my Main Camp), emphasis what was done in regards to August 15th, 2019 and August 14th, 2019 <br>- Content Keepers and how I feel they could be considered a certain record keeper. <br>- Side Characters Defense<br>- Main Spirit Guides, Spirit Guides, Main Guides, Guides,  Main Camp, Camp, Main Xant, Xant. <br>- Business <br>- 4am to 6am that system that my Main Spirit Guides indicated around myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and maintenance regarding. <br>- Clarifications in regards to pro creation in regards to Alex James Hislop and others(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. Incarnation and afterlife setup being what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to what my Main Camp indicated should what my Main Camp indicated in regards to this marking, advocation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) not be listened towards. <br>- Segway and Update Teams<br>- Knowing what people like in regards to should there be times when you want to send nice things and care packages. For example, I like the Vitamins that my Main Spirit Guides indicated but because of certain things some spirits don&#39;t want to send me those vitamins currently lol, but maybe later it could change. Also, Sacred tradings that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. For example, no funny business in regards to trying to slip something bad or put a certain tracked on the sacred trades and giftings that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Civility Reigns.<br>- 1000 Documents in regards to pay off documents in regards to achieving One lense in regards to myself pertaining to stuff that is in which might not have been. Others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated Comment. <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. Light; Do what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to these advocations the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
