<div class="title">(11/24/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Today saw a feeling of movement in regards to some of the infrastructure in regards to behaviours and personality in which felt to be warfare in nature, a certain kind attacking in a certain sense, the changing and moving of infrastructure which lends towards enlightened demeanor and interaction. There was another movement which felt to be putting fourth a different kind of energy, more light in nature and smoother. It seemed to be almost seem as a replacement to that in which was on before that was moved and I felt to almost outside of my house area in a safe way spiritually. Like I didn&#39;t necessarily have to go outside my house for certain interaction to take place in which made sense considering the discussions yesterday and how there is Spirit in which can interact past physical building materials in a certain way. This isn&#39;t fully true for some Spirit but it is for a portion. Interaction discussions and talks of what we are experiencing were probably let know and a big one seemingly at least today had to do with Origin and God as well the idea that Good can intervene in certain places previously thought to not be the case.  The idea that there can be the creation of something more difficult to manage later can also be the solution in what some are pointing towards the potential reasoning as to why God can&#39;t intervene supposedly, the creation of something good that cannot be intervened and in fact with the theory that there is more power with good would seem to fit the bill of truth. Regardless this physical might not exactly be that in which some are pointing towards pertaining to what would be more difficult for certain Spirit to help. A let know that a Spirit comes around sometimes to just hang out in which was seen to a certain degree at the spiritualist meet up. This Spirit has a good way about him and him showing just helps and it makes people feel better, it made me feel better, strangely with all of the positivity and decency, I kind of felt like a spirit of friendship being present was exactly what was needed. It&#39;s more than that, sometimes words don&#39;t speak what needs to be said and the presence spoke enough. I kind of felt like there was aspects of myself and spirit in which felt a bit alienated and at odd ends but understanding the reasoning for this might be the context understood. It just seems to always get back to the battle of life and it really speaks of peace and war. I like to be true and maybe peace is suppose to scare me more yet I feel that some of what some call peace to not be of the spirit pertaining to Peace. It&#39;s a closed door on a cold night, the dark suspicion of innocent, the lack of care upon one another but it doesn&#39;t do justice either and that last part speaks in many ways. That within certain areas what some call peace might be a reprieve to the things that go bump into the night for true. Dark terrors that exist in which would never not consider the reprieve to be peace. For the kind that do not and would not consider it to be might have to do with quality of life and safety, somehow the lack of such a concept for some in certain places had desensitized. Gone with the anger and hatred, to the ever present need of suffering and the continence of whatever it was that brought some to that place. Did I think all of my problems would be solved when i attended that meet up? No, not at all and it was in fact less to do with that intention and awareness to be true but rather had to do with a like and passion in regards to spiritualist endeavors on this planet. This doesn&#39;t mean that the importance necessarily of such partaking was in the spirit of such action but rather I feel it to yet again a mixed bag. That there was reasonings in regards to portions of my life in the spirit and that I was a part of that in some way but the emphasis still stands that I don&#39;t want to burden certain kind in such manners and I don&#39;t want to adversely affect certain kinds of life. I am wondering if the storyline that some were trying to let know of ostracized and alienated had to do with portions of some of the problematic that I am speaking of in which upon my intention speaks of decency and goodness but also awareness and realization. Awakening upon some of that in which has been happening around us in certain manners that some do not want to talk about in which is steeped in both good reasoning and bad. <br>There was a focus on this day to try and get me upset and to try and focus that I might want to get upset but I just as I and others spoke on that anger and Argumentatives, complaining and debate as well as conversation doesn&#39;t constitute one to be harmed or receive a less quality of life, the same could be said about those that do not get angry or argue, complain or even participate in debate. They might have experienced things in which saw them never be that again out of choice, some might be suppressed to not have that mentality and some might have something to be those things. It lets know that not everyone is of certain culture, not everyone needs to have an anti-camp not just by way of not deserving such a machinisms, not just by way of not being that kind but also by way of different kinds of systems that exist. I would continue to experience certain energies this day, certain kind affecting channeling, I felt a certain moment yesterday where I felt certain stimuli that maybe was tried to be decent be way of trying to stop something worse later on but I have difficulty subscribing to experiencing something negative to stave a bigger negative later on. One of the key changes was interaction in which on my end had been changing throughout this past couple months. Some of the negative stimuli I experienced yesterday night was insect feeling in which is sometimes seems psychically similar in regards to what certain exorcism accounts are experiencing except not seeing faces in the setting and things of that nature, although I have certain had my fair share of similar experiences, this has to do with certain touch experiences and sight experiences that is slight compared to what some behind the scenes spiritually in regards to myself are experiencing. Is it a tell about some of the experiences in the spirit in regards to myself? Am I experiencing those experiences as well? What does this let you know about the positive experiences because there has been many in this process as well. I am wondering if there it is also a tell of some of the decent that is taking place when I experience some of the positive too or that that is taking place regardless. Another kind today had been about some of the experiences that happened when I went out of the vicinity to the city and what took place in which had been positively portrayed on my end but has seen certain kind at when I have been outside my own home experience things in which are not fair spiritually. Again another kind existing behind the scenes in regards to some of our lives and not so in which the quality of life has not been decent and some of our actions utilized as a reasoning in regards to some of it taking place. The why of the story matters greatly in why some utilize such reasonings and what exactly is happening spiritually in regards to this especially if it is a global phenomenon. That there is spiritual goodness and enlightenment all around us interacting with us in ways in which corresponds with what the NDE accounts of enlightenment let know of decency and miraculous in the afterlife and more so but also that there is a certain kind in which exists, darker in nature in which is also correlated by psychic writings and distressing NDEs. How my life has unfolded these past five years has been a whirlwind of this, in finding the goodness that exists and should exist and learning what exactly spiritually is taking place in a baseline and to relay some of my findings if possible in a decent way. Channeling, Psychictivty write downs, Diary Entries and the ability to love with God-Realization are some of the content I have been gearing towards these days but there are others in which I have been creating and hitting home on.
