<div class="title">(11/27/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I am not certain at what point I started believing in Good. I suppose it started when  was young by way of the energies that were around me. There were angels I feel protecting me when I was younger. I think I came from angels there were these angelic impressions of my mother I remember when I was younger. It spoke of goodness. It spoke of purity. Of white light. I remember Tina Turner&#39;s Proud Mary when I was younger and for some reason it reminds of certain angelic white light memories, when I was looking at a photo on the wall. It first and foremost though reminds me of Enya&#39;s only time. It&#39;s one of those songs that really reminds me audio wise and impression wise of those earlier angelic memories. Thought to be true when I think of Morality it should remind of Angelic protection and comfort and it does to a certain extent but I sometimes think of video games. Gaming when I was younger the morale choices shone threw as I would always pick the moral choice within those RPGs I played throughout my life. Something gravitated me to choose the good choice. It was a gravity that was there in which made me feel like being the good guy, I am not certain for hero status but rather because it was who I wanted to be. It&#39;s not necessarily a reflection or contrast per say to who I was in the physical in a certain manner, I was sometimes crass and brattish, huckster kind of stuff is what some would say, I wasn&#39;t a terror but not what some thought I would be. Grimey is what some would say but barely to be true. <br>Either way when I would become psychic It changed my life. I started operating with morality and goodness more so than before. The one single key that had a large portion of reasonings as to why this is was because I finally fully recognized that spirit were watching me. That there was multiple kinds of spirit in vicinity interacting and observing me in which made me feel ashamed about the previous acts of depravity, upsetness, anger and breaches in which did matter more so that I would ever know and no where nears to the amount some said that it did at times. It spoke of another reason though in which was the real reason I started operating in a more morale capacity which shouts to the video games I would play and them moral choices I would choose in which again was because I wanted to be that. I still do. Why is it that when some realize that there are a certain kind watching you change how you operate within life, again it speaks of the morality and understanding of ethical machinisms naturally instilled within ourselves thanks o a certain kind. When you look towards some of the alternatives that our lives would have been without the variable of instilled morality, knowing right from wrong and also that understanding that there are spirit watching us, that there are those observing our actions and that privacy isn&#39;t necessarily a dream but rather not what one thought. As I would understand that there are darker propositions out there that exist and meaner dispositions even more than I thought could exist within this world it changed me and not necessarily in a good way but what I held on throughout it and what is sometimes there to blame is that ethical disposition of Morality and Goodness, it&#39;s there at the core of why I put certain defensive information in play regardless of whether it reflects or not or some want to say they were protecting that in which looks good and seems good, there still exists a certain kind in which might not have those dispositions seemingly in which some of it was stolen away upon some still being able to operate without such things and then shoehorned into a place in which says that defending is somehow wont of innocence. Actions speaks louder than words but even the vanity of the look upon Morality can change the tone and help, you don&#39;t necessarily have to be a defender and an understanding sometimes lost that there are those that are naturally looking good, not as in cool but rather as in moral. Some use to think it was the same thing and in some culture it still is considered, not considered the correct way anymore but still cool and you would expect their to be remembrance and emphasis in such a stance upon the times that have fallen. Even with the knowledge of a ripple affect achieved, a hope given and breathing granted especially when you are not doing the things that some would consider to be the good be it the problem that I have specifically when their are other kinds that would potentially try to utilize such a lens to do harm than rather what it stands for classically and modern. <br>I don&#39;t know that I have a problem but a part of what I am speaking about has to do with some of the events of two days ago. An arrival in which from some have been doing certain actions speaking of good in which upon the realism and reality of my experiences have sewn a disposition of dubiousness at times within those seemingly enacting good in which I feel has been forgotten is some pretending to be Good in anti-camp capacity affecting the actions of certain good within vicinity. So when we see a certain good action be manipulated do we need to blame it on the good? No, I am not certain that we do and I think we need to understand if another kind is trying something to affect those good actions that help us. You know that maintenance of such things and it&#39;s the point that the good can&#39;t always be around to keep certain ripple affect and actions from turning a different direction that I have difficulty with upon looking towards the Original Creator and saying you have the power to be able to save and you have the technology to achieve it and the understanding that you know in which I don&#39;t have is not good enough to keep myself and others from feeling like you can solve the problems when you can even given the times, difficulties and histories of partial stave to get where we are upon those stat figures of things getting better and the shouts of it could be worse from the darker crowds while seemingly their rights change too. When they said that those enlightened energies could be bad in insinuation and spiritual communication, I found it to be not true. I found faith and belief in regards to the goodness but realism and reality knock at the door as to what exactly took place and how were those actions altered. <br>A psychic medium that can feel those energies of many do just get up go and leave this process, a spotlight and opening in the sky like some sort of  heavenly arrival and then gone in subtle change and movement following to wherever the heck I got put in the transportation line and travel migration. Just because I don&#39;t feel there to be spiritual travelling going on doesn&#39;t mean that that is the case because there seems to be a machinisms letting know we are in flight. Yesterday would see multiple argumentatives invoked and certain kind continue to harass spiritually. There was something going on in certain dimensional area in regards to earth and others, some want it to be though of that it was not in regards to earth but physically speaking I am still located on earth and I am not certain there is a portion in which are facilitating an intraction so said to not be of earth in which is partially good and decent. Of course that continued discussion of the battle within our homes spiritually, that somehow we need to leave our homes and go for a walk for safety continues to try and be invoked when I continue to let know that there is a large portion where that isn&#39;t the case where spiritual for some can traverse the boundaries of certain physically they do daily. When I woke up this morning I had been attacked spiritual and physical to the point of head are other dimensional stimuli that told me that channel, behavior, thoughts and memory as well as interaction systems were affected. It&#39;s these kinds of observations that can make it difficult to focus on the good especially when I get drawn into debates and argumentatives in which some kind still is not being given what needed not to feel that it&#39;s a breach of quality of life upon when I speak. There was this interaction in which was put on me which spoke of continued woes within life, young self infrastructure in which was told be related to that dream of trees and land rover having to do with a family member, multiple to be true.  They said this version of myself had something to do with cyclops. A species said to be real upon understanding that fictional species we have depicted on this physical planet are very much real in certain spiritual, potentially physical as well. There was an anger, sadness and happiness of this species in how I have viewed them to be. It also spoke of the Original Setting in a certain manner. There is a consultation of certain species this day in which was asked how do they about origins and ways to fix some of the difficulties of the times. I got through my writing portion in which I have been writing multiple kinds of stories, some for fun, some that are personal in a certain sense and others in which are good ideas to invoke. Either way its been lending towards crafting and honing writing skills but I don&#39; always do it daily, today seemed to be one of those times where I could belt through it. A time that has seemingly been on my side today where I don&#39;t feel I a m running out in which has made me wonder abut the ripple affect regarding and those in which are not benefiting but maybe that isn&#39;t the correct mindset to have. Maybe none is ill benefiting. I got through the writing portion of my daily activities in three hours. I think three hours is decent and some say that I could get it done much sooner which is probably truth. In working on this I would like to get that finished within two hours. An hour and a half for fictional and a half our for non-fictional. The way I am experiencing my interaction is seeing multiple things in which looked like full scale battle be different, we need to understand if the interactions i was experiencing are still taking place upon my actions whether it&#39;s being let know or not within my interaction. I have been creating more board on the peacekeeperalex trello account. These board carry multiple kinds of informational placements in which can be quite important. If there is not too many physicals on this physical planet earth creating disclaimers in the ways that I have been creating especially from the mind set of spirit guides reliance. Some of the things I want to do include creating a Main Spirit Guides Board in which to put fourth the translations of the words Main Spirit Guides in other languages in which is probably already located on the net. <br><br>-(Multiple changes in regards to Angelic Energies coming around and different kind of discussions pertaining to inspiration but also other kinds in regards to who we are and what are our past lives. There was a moment yesterday during some of the turmoil where they tired to label me the bad guy again, like some past life I had or something but I continue to say that I don&#39;t feel that to be the case. My energies and Who I am doesn&#39;t fully reflect that but being realistic means is seeing through some of that link knowing we can be different people at different times and just as the good say it&#39;s their the enlightened version of who we are seemingly hidden amongst life the same could be said potentially about the bad. Considering in the waking life we are more peaceful these days on earth what does that mean? Comprehension was affected as well during a certain moment. I felt someone change my comprehension behind the scenes in which saw multiple events take place. My comprehension is only suppose to bet the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.)<br><br>Informational Placement:<br><br><br><br>Themes:<br>#Time #RippleAffect #HigherSelvesOfSpiritThatHaveHarmed<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
