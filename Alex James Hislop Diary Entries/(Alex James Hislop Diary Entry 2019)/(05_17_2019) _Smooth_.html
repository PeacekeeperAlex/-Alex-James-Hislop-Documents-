<div class="title">(05/17/2019) &quot;Smooth&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Before I went to bed last night this huge reveal in regards to certain kind of head area softness having to do with certain kinds of fluidity and water in which reminds me of the left, certain kinds of left culture but in which is not exclusive. In my perception when I think of certain kinds of peoples I sometimes get a smooth kind of feeling in which I have discerned sometimes having to do with hair colour as well as other kinds. The show the 100 came up yesterday in regards to certain peoples and I could feel my perception and certain mechanisms in regards to myself being utilized in a certain kind of ways pertaining to game of thrones where certain spirits were utilizing reaction and interaction in which I sense in a distance sort of way regardless of whether it was something I was going for or not, I then noticed this other kind of happening in which was almost like I could sense a certain kind of overlap and story unfolding in regards to this smooth energy story in which I also discerned did impact game of thrones, the intro has some of this smooth kind of energy at times. I discerned that spiritual Guideship had to do with this sort of energy and smooth vibes in which was said to also be a certain kinds of overlap in which was based off of an earlier interaction in regards to certain systems, I remember thinking about certain people and interacting in regards to it earlier except it was different now and more things were said to be created. I Noticed newer energies being created facilitate something in which might be consuming those smooth energies. These kinds of systems and discernment in regards to some of this earlier had to with interaction and perception of certain people as well as certain head area energies which let me know that this was something that was potentially there already and again in which other potentially have noticed without being able to fully identify. This Potentially had something to do with certain kinds of long game interaction and future. Future-past interaction frameworks where you could be interacting with a future room in which i set to potentially make it into the future where when you interact in the future all of a sudden your past self make an entrance and the past interaction that was in regards to the future makes it through to certain areas. I have continued to watch game of thrones but I also did a couple of key moves, one of which was put a stackful of (AJHD) information physical print outs on earth for a couple of hours. <br><br>There is this sort of half awake and half in dream kind of head area craziness that I have felt at times in which is sort of something earlier in my life I have felt upon being half asleep and half awake. I am not cert if it was somebody being upset by way of certain kinds of multi tasking or if it was a tell in regards to earlier life. Some were insinuating that this sort of stuff, myself and other getting attacked was from before andI feel there are others that have felt this head area feelin, if it is a truth that some of this stuff was from before and that there are those experiencing similar kinds of stimuli then this does potentially have more to do with than just me and potentially includes certain percentages on this physical planet Earth and elsewhere. <br><br>Advocationals:<br>Wax Technology especially the healing kind as well as cryogenic kind.<br>Awaken and non-awaken as well as knowledge disparities. Someone affecting a lot of different thing by way of what he knows. <br><br>Defense:<br>Doing brimstone-like tactics and brimstone tactics to stave certain kinds of actions being blocked by way of it being utilized against to harm and attack as well as compensate. <br>Awaken and non-awaken disparities, knowledge disparities and how that lends towards shaping and interaction within life and elsewhere. <br>Awareness advocations and conversation tracks the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>Monetaries in regards to paranormal mover and shakers as well as those thought of to not need coin that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the paranormal communities.<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.

Clickable links like the show all actions on the Peacekeeperalex trello account and attachments section where upon me clicking links shows up on my screen has been at times shoehorned into a spot where some in the spirit think that it needs to be shown in order for it to work. If I never traverse to Google.ca that doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist in the public especially the spiritually that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The data upon clicking some of those links on the peacekeeperalex trello account and the Alex James Hislop Documents on Github are public regardless of whether I click them or not, they have public links in which exist online especially in regards to the Spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
