<div class="title">(06/10/2019) &quot;Of the Original Light&quot; </div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- Yesterday I went to Newmarket and the Day before I went to Newmarket as well. The first day I went with my Parents in their car and the second I took the bus. ALl interesting events happened and yesterday when I was at the Bus stop, I had focused on certain things. <br>- I had created 180 or so advocations on long before in regards to AJH Earth Doing Callwords on the AJH Daily Defenseives Board which is now public. <br>- I then started working on doing certain kinds of visualization access and other kinds of energy impression which stemmed from the events on Friday during the near end of the Basketball game.<br>-  One of the things I did at the bust stop while standing on earth was move certain kind of learning and right before I hooked up to certain systems spiritually with my head area and feet area. I could feel connecting to certain systems in higher up and lower down in my feet area, potentially connecting to a certain part of Earth as well as other spiritual entities. <br>- I then tried kung fu impression and tried to evolve certain kung fu impressions by way of utilizing Evolution energies. It got everybody&#39;s attention and kind of created a bit of a smoke and mirrors, It was right in the middle of certain kinds of happening ing and hearing within my process pertaining to one of the events couple days before. <br>- I had opened multiple kinds of light by way of visualization access in regards to Jamie Hart&#39;s physical property, one was a golden water, in which I surmised from Near Death Accounts that Beauty if a big part of some of the afterlife that is seen but I don&#39;t think for some of them it has to be exclusive to those that are beautiful, i think if you wanted to be ugly or a different kind that that is a possibility. One of things about iti the day before yesterday was the idea that the beauty seen within these lights extends to the soul as well which i utilized in regards to manifesting access in regards to white spirits, <br>- The idea of looking towards what my Main Spirit Guides indicated by way of Callword utilization and Mechanics and the the utilization of visualization to create access. In this instance it was white spirits I went to by way of my Karmic understanding to be that White Spirits are the highest up karmically in regards to certain colour paradigms. <br>- I also on friday, created black spirits as well although with certain kinds of velvety beauty in which I discern that I should also be manifesting at times the dry kind of black spirits to a certain degree. <br>- This then though extended to visualizing white light. Classic spiritual information in regards to Ghosts is to look towards the light and I surmised that we could do similar things in regards to look upon certain light and afterlife in which doesn&#39;t just stem in regards to the light but also other dimensional and non-dimensional, The idea to look towards the light while physical which can give access and open certain light as well as reveal certain light, all three, open in certain dimensional existence, reveal that some of them were there the entire time and give access by way of certain spiritual mechanisms. Which is where <br>- Again that sort of thing happening where certain spirits go good by given a choice after certain bad life and then the life utilization and stealing of my life partially intertwined. It&#39;s been insinuated that certain choices were given to live decent life at pivotal legal moments and beforehand.<br>-  the day before there was also let know of hip hop, smooth jazz, rock and roll as well as other cultures associated potentially experiencing certain spiritual turbulence. I remember listening to kendrick lamar which went really well, i like the album, trying to listen to multiple hip hop albums. I chilled out on that one and stayed away from certain advocationals in which certain teams were in a certain spot partially by way of interaction in which lead to a decent time of it. Because of some of the turbulence and interaction as well as the relation in regards to Eminem and Jamie, voice and other kinds, when i turned on the next album in regards to Eminem a certain kind came around in which did not back off to enable me to stay a certain kind. <br>- My advocations and information as well as power in regards to my information has changed within the past three days and the Economics regarding it allow someone to say that something isn&#39;t correct and investigate certain aspects of those that are impacting, influencing and affecting those Economics in which there is multiple groups already analysing that aspect as well. This made it so in the past 3 or 4 days that my information creation hasn&#39;t been to blame creating a problematic with a certain emergence in regards to blaming me by way of some of the horrible things that have happened through me and others in regards to my process and others. <br>- Either way I discerned some trying to utilize certain reasonings in regards to some of the things that have happened within Eminem&#39;s life and I basically felt like there just wasn&#39;t any reason to attack and harm spiritually just because someone is cool and famous. One fighting for ones life in regards to multiple kinds as well as others is a normal response at times. Especially with the alternatives that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that exist and can exist even within the confines of Brimstone and what can seem brimstone specifically where the difference is negligible and that being the difference between the quality of life received in a disparity that shouldn&#39;t exist anyhow. <br>- It kind of felt like some people were hopping a ride on Saturday the 8th, from certain famous but I am not certain. One thing I need to let know of is that when I go to big cities, the spirit of the City in which does exist in many different forms is partially aware at times in regards to my presence and as a psychic i can feel the city atmospherics as well as other kinds of spiritual atmospherics. I walk in a city and there is large updates happening. Anyhow multiple storylines happening at times.This was also an indicator that something was happening by way of update,s, legal and punishment. There has been storylines and certain spirit perpetuating being from certain banners, specifically Trene culture banners in my process in which has cause certain events to unfold. <br>- This is a part of the bring up of three concepts fairly regularly in multiple kinds of ways to be insinuating to be working against me but also help me in different ways with focus on the negative by way of what I speak about at times. Immorality, Anti-Camps and Banners in which I have lamented upno shouldn&#39;t be brought up in certain fashion in regards to be working against myself in certain manners in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated by way of the damage that has been brought on those three concepts in regards to the utilization of working against myself and others. Which might partially be why certain concepts are being worked on to be working against myself or further perception that might be the case. Thieves and Faith being some of them, forewarned. <br>- There is a War happening at times that extend beyond banners that I discern the Original Light to be on multiple sides at times. In fact, I discern them to be a bit of a referee at times in which I do not feel that to be always the case and in certain circumstances. This war that I speak of from my perception encapsulates many wars in which some are trying to be intertwined by way of my process and the utilization of my spiritual mechanisms and other s spiritual mechanisms as well. <br>- One one side of this War I discern blue smooth energies and a status quo, a certain kind of Rome if you will. On the other side, Dry at times and also dark and red. It has to do with multiple kinds fissures, some of which happens to do with land, Culture, and a big one is direction. I have noticed Long game mend and how we approach that topic as well as groups in the mix with life utilization difficulties in the middle of it as well.<br>- One the bus ride yesterday after certain mechanism utilization a supreme kind of energy was around me explaining certain things in which I discerned certain clashes to have happened. It was said that good guys had won and one of the big things i did beforehand upon entering the bus while standing on earth in a location where i don&#39;t usually stand was letting know about the Original Light which there was been clarifications in regards to the Original Light. A breakthrough the past couple days in regards to the Truth which we need to know is true. If it&#39;s just a higher light especially in regards to the bad guys that have been plaguing at times then that needs to be known. I then let know that I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) consider the Light to be the Light that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light. Followed up by multiple other advocations for my Main Spirit Guides information in the Original Light to be displayed where my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to multiple topics. Physical Out loud voice with spiritual augmentation to hit home in multiple capacities. <br>- On the bus ride to newmarket it felt like I was put in a higher up place and that that kinds of stuff where I look at someone changes their life, where we live lives together in higher up dimensional places some might not even consider to be buffer anymore as well as in dimensional existences a part of multidimensional communities. <br>- The Original Light I feel was around and the acceleration and deceleration information that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to how to be able to interact with the Original Light without streamline and accelerating events is needed to be understood. <br>- There was a warning shot in regards to Higher up Light utilizing life stealing in manners from certain physicals on this physical planet Earth in certain ways. I discerned as certain kind of life utilization in regards to multiple where they lived decnet life in which the physical perspective and what that entails too was not included. There was insinuation that it could go that way and insinuated that there was things like that happening more so than currently already is. Heck, one example of this already being is the mechanisms that use physicals and other-dimensionals are supposed to have access towards, like a chalk board in the mind being put through the ring and us having to go through hoops on such levels that makes it silly to even utilize. The other kinds speak of dimensional rights issues to a certain degree it&#39;s not just physicals. <br>- On the bus ride home I had a bit of an argument on the Bes in my mind with certain spirits. Near the end of the argument I utilized certain vents that my Main Spirit GUides indicated in the light in which my Actions and non-actions only do what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I then displayed Indigo Information and Black information in a certain manner by way of impression and spiritual mechanism to defend myself. They said it defined myself but it is a part of the Black and Indigo theme in regards to myself. <br>- Multiple discussions and standing on earth yesterday as well and a really cool moments at McDonalds as well too. Content experiences in regards to Canada and Alex James Hislop vs McDonalds the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>- Multiple vindication from going to my old work spot restaurant, to connecting to the TIm hortons Wifi to reveal the 911 disclaimers on the Peackeeeperalex Trello account to going to Canada Computer. <br>- There is this mandate form certain authorities in regards to this process and at times there are some that have not been listening as well as some pretending to be of certain kind. In the mix there is both at times trying to help but there is a dimensional rights issue in the mix and bad guy somewhere. <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
