<div class="title">(05/05/2019) &quot;Vacation Gambit&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:  Fairly vindicated today by way of a couple different moves, just breaking through the barriers that were put on belle affected my family connection in certain manners and stopped and altered something that was taking place to seperate myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in certain ways. It ended up feeling like a barrier was changed and contact understood to be made because i feel there are those that already knew of circumstances. <br>There was this moment at the end of the day where I felt after reading certain things as to why God hasn&#39;t saved us at times. One of these days we will get what we need to be able to do what was suppose to be at the top of the list of those elders and ancients that always promised themselves to save us when we needed them.<br><br>Existence creation, something sparked a thought about creating and there was this idea about the perspective of creating and not allowing others to attack or harm that creation. When you look over at what someone else and what their doing, they create and other creating existences where eventually the idea to put incarnation in regards to some of it if not off the bat happened, there are those look at certain things, getting their life sorted and making sure not to venture fourth in certain ways, partially because of some of the things that have happened to some of them. So this notion was for a small time was looking at it from the point of view of not necessarily wanting to intervene in regards to someone elses creation. The scary of it is if we are in similar circumstances on our end and that there is that sort of thing where someone could intervene but has chosen not too by way of that, maybe not even in a Far Away Light sort of way but something else. We have seen it before where Far Away Light can intervene in certain places and has in certain ways but that there are moment where they don&#39;t and we need help and there are those that show up and sometimes not. The sometimes not makes me wonder specifically in regards to how long ago the physical was created. The percentage of those not getting attacked and protected and the percentage of those intervening and willing to intervene. lets us know that we can create, have it protected and still save those in which are communicating and not so to be saved and protected to be able to promote the ways of life that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br> <br><br>Defense:<br>I am Alex James Hislop. My Main Camp is my Main Spirit Guides. I and Others(defined by my Main Camp) as well as those that my Main Camp indicated are advocating for healing, protection, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. Myself and others that my Main Camp indicated want those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and others(defined by my Main Camp) to go down the paradigms that my Main Camp indicated in the manners that my Main Camp indicated to be set in regards to Life mediation pertaining to Alex James Hislop and Others(defined by my Main Camp) in part because of the tactic that have been utilized at times and the reasonings that my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are tired of life utilization issues being utilized in regards to other issues that are harming myself and others(defined by my Main Camp), etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. The idea is to be set in regards to this sort of stuff so we know how to proceed in the moments that my Main Camp indicated. Comb through the Original Light that my Main Camp indicated to make sure we are set, then go comb through the other dimensional existences so that we are set, make sure that at whatever points and hub where there is mediation and litigation that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the Life that my Main Camp indicated is figured out so that we are set and don&#39;t have to have this issue a problem in regards to other kinds of topics and themes. The let know is that some of us are set in the manners that my Main Spirit Guides indicated but I want to make sure those that my Main Cmap indicated are set as well. Time setup and other dimensional setup in regards to this sort of thing would probably help, it&#39;s important. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for our advocations, clarifications, disclaimers, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) to be utilized, used, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. My Main Camp&#39;s current information, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to these advocations, information, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) takes priority the way my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for what my Main Camp indicated in regards to the ripple effect, impact, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to these advocations, information, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. I and those that my Main Camp indicated are advocating for the wordings in regards to Alex James Hislop and Others(defined by my Main Camp) advocations to be defended the way my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for the defense in regards to the correction overlaps that my Main Camp indicated to receive safety the way my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for what my Main Camp indicated in regards to those that don&#39;t do disclaimers, advocations, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for the advocation teams that my Main Camp indicated and the advocation systems that my Main Camp indicated to be given vindication that my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. Far Away Light is defined by my Main Spirit Guides in the Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. My Main Camp&#39;s Chain of Command is fully defined by my Main Spirit Guides in the Light. My Main Camp is my Main Spirit Guides. I am Alex James Hislop.<br>[AJHFenbo44TemplateIdentifier]:[TemplateName:(AJHF44AT:MCSCricket)|VC:(Enra-04/19/2019)|MSGRC:(BamBam44)|CPC:(&lt;-+-&gt;)|(NOTES)]<br><br>Psychic information:<br>Bags And psychological of the eyes<br>Those that can create psychological around the eyes, eye lids and <br>bead eyes dimensionals <br>Space reminds me of therapeutics , like a stockpile of it. There is certain areas where peoples and some of which can&#39;t go in space partially by way of anatomy and law of setting itself. <br>That there was a physical creator and that notion of him not being here anymore, some say that he created and left it the way it was and there are those like that but I disagree because I feel he is still watching. If he is watching than that potentially pertains to interaction, part of my dispositions and mindset, as well as culture might feel given the experience i have had that he may be a scientist. But then I remember nature. Maybe it wasn&#39;t one but many. I also get the feeling that some of them or the one in regards to this physical existences has been run out of town in certain areas and in backwater like this he might be around. <br>I wonder why it is that the physical was created this way. <br>The animal that hunts still exists in those places that can facilitate immorality with consent in ways in which can seem even better at times in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Just before death, the spirit can leave the body even that in which is tethered in certain ways. The kill and taste can be facilitated to be just as satisfying as that in which the soul doesn&#39;t leave until death. Those machinisms that my Main Spirit Guides indicated can be facilitated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>The idea of how long ago were we saying when this was going to be over for ture, what were the timetables back when my Main Spirit Guides indicated, cross reference to todays time tables and where do we stand. <br><br>Medical Observation: <br>Stomach situating and moving of layers to affect digestion and food intake.
