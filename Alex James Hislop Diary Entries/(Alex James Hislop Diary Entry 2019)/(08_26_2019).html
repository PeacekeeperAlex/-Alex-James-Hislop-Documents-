<div class="title">(08/26/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Hectic Early morning morning pursuits in which the pace changes as I worked on certain things, this shouldn&#39;t be an indicator because there are times when I continue on with my life and the pace would have changed regardless but it being the difference in gaining access to security and safety I feel is not the way of things.<br>- There is lines being employed at times, where I am getting shoehorned out of certain areas in which I did not fully intend in certain contexts and some of which is in line with me wanting to go to certain areas to a certain extent in which can still help to a decent sized degree. If I can be protected in a certain manner in the areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated than I feel the way my main Spirit Guides indicated but at times I have discerned this to not be the case. <br>- Emphasization teams should not be blamed for letting know of things in which have existed and exist in multiple manners. When I feel psychic harm happening and modification to the stimuli to reflect not feeling that anymore, some are trying to emphasis it is taking place and some are trying to protect some in which do not want to feel that way. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) choose what my Main Camp indicated chose for us to choose the way my Main Camp indicated. <br>- There has been an interesting dynamic both scary and interesting in regards to some of the meeting points this weekend. There will be an emphasis in a certain manner in which points towards some trying to prevent certain battle and warfare upon certain mediation and diplomacy but in which certain tactics are being employed in regards to a suppression of understanding and truth in ways in which feels more heavy handed in the smoothness department even though there is civility in regards to some of it more so than seen seemingly in certain areas. Again, some might be trying to employ these lines to goad another kind but I feel there is multiple instances where a suppression of proxy in which for some is to protect under the guise of other-dimensional selves, some in which might be that, to have reasoning in regards to proxy suppression but I go with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light for a reason. Especially with emphasis in said that my battle is higher up and that it might actually truly be that without any battle per say. How important is this life I am living in regards to myself and is this really going to be a Nevermore in regards to a certain kind of natural incarnation at least in regards to this physical perspective of myself Alex James Hislop. As I wrote this I felt my physical perspective get tested in a certain manner. Again, I feel my perspective, a shoehorn earlier on in regards to the driving <br>- Another storyline was that someone was trying to make a point in regards to this life in regards to how some have felt. <br>- Continued smooth routes and movement upon a day in which was supposedly going to see certain conflicts potentially on me end. I feel some of those conflicts might still be taking place in a certain manner. I feel there are aspects of myself in which are potentially doing other kinds of activities, I have noticed the channel change and less comedic, it lets me know there is also potentially a flotilla process in regards to facilitating certain kind. <br>- Stealing of Immorality promotion and things like that in multiple kinds of ways, energy draining and feeling utilization as well as feng shui before being able to promote certain kinds of immorality within content experiences even seemingly. There are those that promote immorality in a certain capacity and there is certain unfairness in multiple regards, some in which might have to do with being able to promote certain kinds. <br>- We got to a point where yesterday we realized that I found my direction and others found their direction by way of understanding and recognizing that for some of us Our Main Spirit Guides have been in the Original Light for a while now. <br>- I have discerned the presence of sunshine, some were trying to pull metaphoricals, sunshine being old light being dragged down the street with my behaviors what&#39;s the spiritual metaphor for behind the scenes regarding.<br>- God presence around myself, a certain sacred Human embodiment of Humanity, light sandy blonde shaggy beard, a Man Tanned in which reminds me of Cast Away with Wilson. God Metaphorical in regards to the Light. <br>- Multiple groups around, those two, one about certain physicals presence in regards to my house pertaining to missing physical items another having to do with Physicals digital following.<br>- - Drivers has been a big thing, yesterday a certain kind came around ,that sort of stuff similar to moving in quick vibrations only this has had to do with something different, like moving dimensions quickly overlapping, movers and shakers of dimensions kind. I discern recognization and acknowledgement as well as a consciousness capsule near the back of head head involved. Multiple kinds of water and ship visuals as well as dimensional stimuli. <br>- There was also a certain kind of thing let know a certain presence around at times where I hung out with Jesse, some said a perspective in regards to myself and maybe to do with the lower octane version of myself when Jamie first moved in, there was this Authority T-Rex-like impression upon the shaping of my eyes and face at times in which they have said to have utilized to harmed at times.<br>- Hung out ant the Beach. One of the best things to do I feel is to smoke some weed then jump in the water in which creates this really amazing synergy, body and mechanisms refreshed coupled with a clean High.  <br><br>Advocational:<br>Why we care about those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, certain areas in which at times has clashed with how we view things. Some in which are in regards to the facilitation of the disparities that exist.<br>Those that have been left behind and the regulars in this process<br>those that facilitate movement and those that safeguard movements, drivers and other kinds.<br>Explanations being displayed where my Main Camp indicated in the moments that my Main Camp indicated.<br>Energy Teams that my Main Camp indicated.<br>Containment Teams that my Main Camp indicated.<br>Contentment Teams that my Main Camp indicated. <br><br><br>Themes: <br>#Revelations #War #Peace #Venting #Truth #Past #Sunshine #Light #Justice #Safety #Rehabilitation #ContentExperiences #WhyWeLikeTheBadGuyAuthoritiesThatMyMainSpriitGuidesIndicated #Clarifications #Comedy<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
