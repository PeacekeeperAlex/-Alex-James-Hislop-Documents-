<div class="content">Mood: Scared, Upset<br>Quote:<br>Thought: Hope beyond all has both been feared and Relied.<br><br>Horoscope:  Don&#39;t be surprised if you feel a powerful affection for someone you&#39;ve met at work. This could be a friendly affection or it could be stronger than that. If the latter, it might not be a good idea to express this emotion overtly. The feeling could pass as quickly as it came, or the person might be emotionally unavailable. Be discreet!<br><br>Horoscope Actuality: The kinds of energies promoted today doesn&#39;t feel to be love related or and at times even cordial. I kind of felt like this Horoscope was way off the Radar in regards to what I am experiencing at times but I could be wrong.<br><br>Activity:<br>- I would still continue to see these energies of distress and stress not only upon my body but the atmospherics as well. A continued reminder of something that certain spirit want to take out of context and label a certain kind in which potentially speaks of warfare even when a certain kind may not be viewing it that way. There have been moments where spiritual communication has let know that there are some spirit that would take my experiences out of context and one of the things that is upsetting to some is that I have coherency in a certain sense within the recorded experiences and relaying of events not only within my Diary Entries but also content experiences creation. I feel some would rather consider to be something else but upon some of the mentality and mindset that I have presented at times in awareness and knowing that some of the things portrayed from certain kind is not truth and that some of it has been facilitation in regards to this process to potentially for some of it have it have happen but also to sow discord and incoherence in regards to events taking place. <br>- There was a moment where it looked to be upon me leaving this room and a certain negative channel experience as well as sending certain kind away, similar to yesterday on the right of me certain spirit leaving in which looked to be by way of there dimensional glider but today it just looked like they disappeared. Where did they go in regards to their afterlife? There seemed to be a higher spirit I could discern on top of my head in which I did not fully realize was there in regards to other dimensional and some of the energies I feel normally in which upon me leaving this room he stopped doing something he had been doing in which was insinuated to be protection in regards to a certain kind. He shut something down but I felt myself get lifted and moved other dimensional to a cleaner vibration area. I am not certain if this spirit is in regards to me but he might. There have been certain kind doing certain things to certain spirit to try and get some to think that they stimuli in which some are experiencing are video game existences and not real. Note that certain video game communities have been under duress this past couple days to a certain degree. I am not certain if it&#39;s connected but there has been moments within my process where some have try to insinuate and label what I have been through and what other have been through is not real. This is a part of the current storyline and theme that I am noting to do with framing and overall trying to get away with certain actions also discrediting.  feel it&#39;s been falling flat on it&#39;s head and I am not certain that there the Dimensional Existences that my Main Spirit Guides indicated to blame. <br>- Another thing they have been doing in this process has been trying to pretend that I am other family members of mine in which has been <br>- Karmic within the past couple days has bee an interesting topic point and there are some that tried to relay that the Original Light might not operate within the confines of Karmic Progression that has been depicted at times. I feel that there was some that affected certain dimensional with some of this let know. <br>- There is multiple let knows about lower dimensional existences within my process and people and spirit that we have left behind under duress and turbulence taking place. Why is this happening? The scary thing is that there are those located below in which might be of the Original Light in certain capacities. <br>- Upon going outside I felt to be a part of the Air. Like a consciousness of mine was linked within the air in which has been referenced at times as life itself. This was after someone shut down certain defense works and interaction in which felt in line and in step with how i was feeling this day and others were feeling but I can&#39;t help shake the feeling that something was off. The insinuated that good came to get this spirit certain defense works down but I am wondering if they were good at all.<br>- Also there has been a bit of a thing in regards to camouflage and what we are experiencing and what we are not. There was a moment earlier where I felt a spirit go into camouflage pertain to touch but also another moment where I felt certain kind that were attacking me no longer feel They somehow claimed I was not of the one for not caring about that certain spirit can still feel the stimuli in attacking me but rather focusing on the stimuli pertaining to what I can feel.<br>The old code.<br><br>Themes: #History #Cold #<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
