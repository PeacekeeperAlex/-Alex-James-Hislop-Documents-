<div class="title">(12/05/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>There is this idea that maybe some of jumped in to help things. In front of the scenes for physical human on this physical planet earth and for other dimensionals as well in certain society I knew that in front of the scenes live at times for some of it wouldn&#39;t be able to fully facilitate that help. So then I thought about Coherency and a God spark behind the scenes in regards to some of us and that to jump into help in regards to some of these lives that there must be places in other dimensional with other dimensional selves in which do facilitate that kind of need. Spiritualist Communities have talked about other-dimensional selves in which I feel they have the right thing of it. It speaks and is in line with some of the information they have been circulating in regards to physical planet earth and spiritual earth. I have at times been aware of some of the darker elements in which has been at times echoed form some of the spiritualist within the spiritualist communities. That there are other-dimensional selves that have been through a lot and that live darker lives for some of us. I feel that there is is a portion in which might be considered life utilization in which it is sanctioned or not. Either way there is also other-dimensional selves that do live coherent lives in safety and quality of life. For some of them they may try to hep certain situations behind the scenes. Some might have become Law enforcement or even Military. It exists. We don&#39;t deserve to be attacked for such a thing happening. They don&#39;t deserve to be attacked for such a thing happening in front of the scenes and I don&#39;t think that flies with certain authorities. On either side of certain thresholds. It was still a realization I have had this past week that have been chalked full of large realizations and let knows. One was the idea and asking about certain kinds of big miracles and things happening upon certain people passing on. I have noted some claim that somehow it might be incredible for certain things to take place but the the great thing about me talking about the Original Light and going there daily for information and input in direction is that they have have see incredible things take place. Miraculous and wondrous in places that thought it would never be. There are some that say that maybe too many miracles in one spot might be bad but it&#39;s not just happening with miracles but also science and other concepts as well too. There also has been large scale miracles happen behind the scenes and in front of the scenes. Some of it has been daily and it brought up an interesting variable that has to do with power utilization from some in the spirit. There was a movement I felt a couple days ago when talked about a written down and potentially again when talked about within a content experience. That some have been utilizing a certain power within my life that is supposed to be reserved for certain things upon my death and birth. One was a bout my death and the miracles provided in moving God Spark that my Main Spriit Guides indicated to safe areas but also other kinds as well. Why would there such a power in regards to my own life? It sounds to be self indulgent to be true. But upon my own experiences and interaction with the spirit and the gravity that I have felt throughout my life at times, partially in regards to some of the things that I have done creating energy placements is one of them but also some of the turbulence supposedly in regards to my own life as well as the informational creation and not to mention the spiritual. I have noted energies of large scale battle, I have felt natural disasters happen behind the scenes, swirling dimensions getting sucked into certain areas and some of which wasn&#39;t decent I am fairly certain and I think some of it wasn&#39;t in regards to a certain power upon me leaving this place in a certain context. It&#39;s not just about me thought but also a certain grouping of spirit. Within that context it gets even more interesting when noting power levels and grants upon death and going to other places. One thing that should be noted is that there is power within passing and it&#39;s not just about reviewing ones own life and it&#39;s not just about the famous. Sometimes it&#39;s about spirit that were not left behind and sometimes it&#39;s about the spirit that is going to be left behind. The life utilization regarding this should not snag such a power level to maneuver what was supposed to be maneuvered and what should be maneuvered in the context that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. Imagine you are born with a certain allpersonal that has a life in regards to your own incarnation. That upon passing on that spirit should be coming with you to those places in the afterlife. Should we even have to utilize a power level granted upon passing on to retrieve certain kinds of Allpersonal and other dimensional selves left behind when they were not supposed to be left behind? No but that doesn&#39;t mean that some don&#39;t utilize such power to safeguard what should have been safeguarded. Of course what needs to be remembered is those sitting there at the end of it looking upon information that says they would have received help if that wasn&#39;t a need while it shouldn&#39;t have been a need. Another big one talked about was deployment upon my birth, I would create disclaimers in regards to earth and as not of a big deal as it seems to be with all of the disclaimers already in play spiritually it can be seen as a decent thing and at times has been claimed to be much more than that and still is to this day. There was a let know that there are those utilizing certain infrastructure at times that was supposed to be utilized by those that my Main Spriit Guides and myself. Then there was also that let know of energy placement, large energy placements in regards to this life. This is also a talking point in regards to earth and outside earth but it&#39;s also something else as well. That sort of thing that say I was born and left nothing for some to be not true in that I did bring things with me and that spirit brought things in regards to my life. In fact when we are born for most physicals on physical planet earth there is a bringing fourth of resources some of which is in regards to their lives. <br><br><br>- (A moment got brought up where it was let know that I don&#39;t have to feel a certain way in regards to how I proceed within my life pertaining to certain variable specifically in regards to those that are saying that I shouldn&#39;t defend myself especially pertaining to informational creation because it&#39;s not necessarily for a larger portion how I word these informations but rather that I am creating such disclaimers, testification and advocations as well as other kinds in regards to certain subject matter. That some of stuff that has happened behind the scenes has made it not only within my right to create, as it pertaining only to what my Main Spirit Guides Indicated in the Original Light in which they can defer to those in regards to those that take over in regards to the information that I create which shouldn&#39;t be mistaken for the information in which is not being passed on to someone else, but in regards to some of the informational creation I have been doing it has been a safety. The way I word it and the kinds of informational creation I have done has been for the reasonings that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Those continuing to lie about who are in my Main Spirit Guides and what are in my Spirit Guides are potentially lending towards people being harmed and information not be utilized as intended. This isn&#39;t just myself saying this but those that my Main Spriit Guides indicated.)<br>- (There was a moment earlier on when I was watching 13 reasons why and there happened to be a moment where something was see in clarity that said where are the good spirit that are suppose to care and keep us safe.
