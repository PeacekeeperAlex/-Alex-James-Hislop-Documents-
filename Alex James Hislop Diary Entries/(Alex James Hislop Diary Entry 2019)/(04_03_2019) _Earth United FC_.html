<div class="title">(04/03/2019) &quot;Earth United FC&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I took a survey in regards to Survey Circle and it was about Memory and Emotions. The interesting thing about it is in regards to my current predicament in regards to Memory in which as of late I have done certain advocations in regards but it also reminds me of certain things that I have been aware of in regards to Memory. Think of certain holodeck programs and imagine that certain spirits are using our memories in that sort of capacity that for some the memory capture is quite advanced depending on the kind of memory mechanisms and hookups associated as well as not so. We see past live memories for a reason at times and I am wondering if some of it recreation and capture, copies of those memories stored in certain placed but there is also that thought that the memory itself has surfaced in which you are viewing that past life memory in which interacted with your past self. The wonder in it is evident and the spirit I feel agrees in a certain manner in regards to how cool that really is. For me though I haven&#39;t been able to fully think on or see some of the memories of my past in a certain manner, sometimes I see flashes of memories which again lets me know that spirit are utilizing certain memory and are able to bring it in the vicinity and register on the viewer without me having to think on the memory.  Some of the memories I have been aware of at times have changed as well, like someone putting something in the memory and seeing dark figures in the memories themselves. Like a memory I understand and know to be mine having different characteristics that can be seenin the physical different from when that memory was captured. This is a part of some of the psychic attack that has happened at times but I fear it to be worse at times as writing sensitive information that would change my process and others in which could cause great harm. This has been noted since 2017 especially since my time at Ramada Jackson&#39;s Point. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Ramda Jackson&#39;s Point to be protected the way my Main Camp indicated. Either way though when it first started happening in 2017 I was scared because I could not longer pull certain memories and I remember freaking out about it but the scarier of the two is having my memories be attacked in such ways as to feel like when I capture those moments that there were terrible things happening. Who knows what some of the Memory looks like and for some there might be beings that survive and live within the memory itself in which might be terrified at times and are not given an explanation as to what the heel is going on with this process or life itself for them in a certain way. Imagine a big being harassing earth in space and the idea that space itself is some sort of gemstone on some big beings jacket, we would be sitting there saying regardless of what is happening in regards to the bigger being, the quality of life in regards to ourselves is in jeopardy. <br><br>Again it continues to be lamented upon in regards to higher realms that that is where my partial battle is in regards to figuring out certain things, that idea that if certain events unfold in a certain manner and the cause and affect of that sort of thing, IE the long game changing by way of the events that could unfold if they do happen to unfold but having to wait for some of those events to unfold because things can change regarding certain futures but the partial ish of it all is that what happens potentially matters as well. There is certain kind in which exist and when you look at the marvel of it happens, the concept of stuff that will happen, stuff that have happened and stuff happening,  you can&#39;t help but wonder sometimes about those that have access to knowing what is going to happen for true and the worst part about it is that there are those groups that lose access in certain moments where a record is spotless for billions of years or trillions of years in letting know of that stuff, that all of a sudden no longer have that spotless record by way of some sort of Machinism. Some lost access by way of the events that would have had happen but there are those that choose to go a certain path and when you are able to say that, especially in a certain manner in certain places then there is power within that but there is also a siphoning of power as that is revealed to be what it is, whichever they chose it to be and whatever it ended up being.<br><br>I also created the (AJHD) Earth-Based United Nations Documents and the (AJHD) Earth- Based United Nations Peacekeeping. Something to put into play to try and help in a supporting capacity if need be the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>(AJHD) Earth-Based United Nations Documents <br>Excerpt:<br>&quot;<br>Disclaimers:<br>I am Alex James Hislop.
