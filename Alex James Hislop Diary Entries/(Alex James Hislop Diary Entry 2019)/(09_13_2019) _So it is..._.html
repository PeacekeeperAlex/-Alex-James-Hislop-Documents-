<div class="title">(09/13/2019) &quot;So it is...&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- Some of the discussions this morning with the spirit had to do with some of the things that certain Spirit and self are forced to do under the pressures and disparities of the times. I have heard tales of certain aspects of self having to defend oneself upon spiritual attack for a simple thing of even attending a movie. It&#39;s the kinds of stuff that shaped why I have chosen the way I have at times. Another topic of discussion was that of intimacy and the kinds of things some of us experience spiritually in regards. The kinds of things we can do excited myself because there is a great many different energies one can promote during acts of intimacy but for some reason not to be enjoyed by others by sure of the kind spiritual atmospherics around and seemingly lack of defense. <br>- You know it is why I say that we should have instantaneous defense during certain moments Spiritually because not all physical humans on this earth based can Identify and Hollar for spiritual defense in certain moments and the fact that we have spiritual atmospherics pretending that they should somehow know about that at times and have utilized that line in regards to certain spiritual conflict that has arisen in regards to certain physicals on this Earth-Based is being used as an excuse in which shouldn&#39;t just be acceptable and blase utilization. Another tell has been that certain kind have been trying to get me to be more vocal and upset in which hasn&#39;t been working partially because of the events of yesterday and realization that there wasn&#39;t much of reason to attack me and others which for some continued upon going in my house spiritually which lamented upon warfare and conflict. We have seen the utilization of certain systems where there isn&#39;t reasoning even when reasoning is piss poor maneuver to the claims of warfare and conflict. It really surfaced because vindication supposedly happened but what does it look like in days and months as well as years, he k especially if things get back to normal and vindication chips a way specifically in the amount of times if that sort of things takes place, how many spirits perish in those conflict for supposedly those reasonings. How many more will? How many times for some Spirit? This madness is understood and the truth regarding has been apparent through the awareness regardless of suppression of upper bubbles, you don&#39;t think they see through? It&#39;s the silence and lack of action that stops them cold in regards heir tracks and ever apparent seemi fly in the processes that wait for redemption, relief and vindication. What of those that have even forgotten they were vindicated and turned bad because they forgot they were. You know the feg Shui at times on my end to target and vocal the good guys for never being around seemingly has been a twist that some want to lament and utilize to label the bad Spirit and rogues vagabond labelment from certain mob in which upon different society label potentially the good guys but we know better at times and yeah we also know it helps to understand that they are good but just not the good that some know me to be chirping out. There is a storyline in higher heavens that has to do with certain Spirit with rogue like qualities taking up the mantle to save but for me I and others(defined by my main Spirit guides) care about them as it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with them as to why I proceeded the way I do because I and others(defined by my main Spirit guides) are tired of the direction and sick of the bullshit, the slow goings of saving and finding those that need help down here has sickened me to the core and I no longer want to be a part of it and I have no longer wanted to get a part of it. I think it existed before I how life and the more you claim other dimensional in the regards to attack me the worse it becomes in a certain context. It doesn&#39;t surprise me to see some kind protecting and saving me at times that believes in regards in the slower way of things in which certain kind that doesn&#39;t care about either gets me to try and chirp them out. I can feel emphasis in regards to how I respond on spiritual conversations given influences from the spirit around me that shapes response and I am not the only one.<br>- I arrived in town by bus and the walk on church Street fort strained going to the movies. I was protected I think but I felt there were certain kind emphasizing in regards to direction and again upon my phone dying there was this glimmer of what I experienced on the road way in Newmarket days earlier. Where I could feel emotions rising up having to do with not knowing what do next and how I am going to survive and make it on my own. Literal something as silly as finding the next street to be able to get to the Movies Threatre. Upon getting there I decided to get some BBQ, a really cool dive in Keswick and I felt ashamed at times in regards to some of my arguments and upsetness in regards to the spirit. I have had interaction that some look at contrasting with certain spiritual conflict in which has supposedly been lent towards by my own interaction. At a certain point I was sort of feeling quiet and reflective as well as reserved and those energies should be allowed through into this process more so than already tried to facilitate interaction that most agree with in this process at least in regards to certain Argumetnatives regarding myself and along with it the alternatives to Argumentatives facilitation and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides), another thing I want stay away from is insulting or upsetting certain kind although there has already been emphasis in regards to vent areas so when I get upset if I get upset it goes towards certain area facilitation pertaining to venting. I went into the movie and there was a lot of different depictions and let knows in regards to myself and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides indicated as well as potentially on others end. The movie itself is really good and although a hairline not as good as the first still really high quality. A lot of different storylines in regards to some of it but again another that pops up is wonder storyline with the character Hanlon. I caught multiple looks of wonder on some his expression and being gauge spiritual in regards to the content itself at least some of it eve if on my end has let know of certain qualities. Upon taking certain breas from the film and going outside for ecigarette I noticed a certain interaction taking place in which was reminiscinet to the night I watch cannon Busters a certain anime in which I was shot upwards and it felt like clean energy. I felt placed in specific areas spiritually and it felt a bit like Hollywood to be true at this little theatre. The kind of energy areas I was traversing during and after the film as well as the future telling throughout certain moments in the film and bringing fourth of potential pertaining to me and others was illuminating in multiple kinds of ways but it was also there to keep people feeling better potentially because of the conflict spiritually taking place in certain areas. I have been able to tell the discernment of areas where conflict have arisen spiritually like an energy residue pertaining to clashes and things of that nature. There was also higher Spirit working through multiple kinds tis night in which utilization of one&#39;s self has been a topic of discussion. Certain physical humans dislike certain utilization in regards to oneself. Like walking past another physical and spiritual bouncing off of you as launch pad for spiritual confrontation which is a softer way of saying it but it one of those things I have noticed in regards to certain spiritual. Some of it on my end but not exclusive. Upon walking home I felt another kind of spiritual around me letting know about some of the interaction and upon being in Keswick not too far away from my home in which there was updates and interaction in regards to what has been happening on my end spiritually in my home which both makes sense but also not so upon some of the bubble interaction atmospherics that have been within my process.<br>- Another kind of interaction I have noticed Spirit utilize is by way of process setups. What kind of process a person has as well as societal kinds. Like when you enter a certain area spiritually In which may be tethered in regards to a physical area that upon certain spirits entering that area mindset and mentality being different on a certain context, this isn&#39;t always the case and some of this stuff doesn&#39;t work on decent sized percentage if spirits in which are somewhat immune and on other kinds of system in which can not bee affected in certain manners but I have noticed certain bad Spirit at times utilize certain systems to promote immorality then to promote morality.
