<div class="title">(04/21/2020) &quot;Digital Literature&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Quote:<br>“Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”<br>― Oscar Wilde<br><br>+_+                                                                   +_+<br><br>Thought: <br>How do we be true one thyself?<br><br>&quot;Sally forth, Tally Hoe!&quot;<br><br>Activity:<br><br>End of the lines spoken true of how felt upon the hidden obscured of need be operating for the Good as he looks around about forgotten ideals and creeds too far old fashioned but still makes up the greater of Good even if forgotten in some places told to be the Good in which for fear of own safety and own makes one proceed in a telling fashion. Who are those that mater in such matters to be brought up upon the clouth and when is it that the clouth become the unspoken unclouth for clouthness. God forbid you wake up late and God forbid there isn&#39;t some life utilization variable to keep safe the working and recreational do da of the day. God forbid not ability of continue along mid way to scheduling already done and some how the greedy not give it&#39;s due. It seems that the witicisms only go so far and it might be past the point of what we consider to be true upon past viabilities. The joke was the day before yesterday upon such writings but when ability can be many different things upon the setup, when does the looking upon art and ability upon that in which already exists and can exist does not not find the raining seasons of life. Hope exists but the inherit sadness of it all does as well and it was those lines in which I was still greatly saddened. Do we literally need a cinematic shot of undeniable proof upon this process and does it have something to do with the brilliance and tragedy and wrong trajectory of such enactment upon some of life utilization. If we could all just look away in the moments needed then what need be for certain kind of intervening and at what point does that get mistaken for something else. At what point is there literally a variable stopping upon what some would consider even amongst the clarity of that portion of good that holds true what be to the beginnings for some and at what point do I decide to be who I want to be if the roadblocks that were foretold to be continue to get worse. How can we expect spiritual to hold it down for the circumstances upon stance that were never suppose to be regardless of revelation and especially upon those that don&#39;t remember as such and how could it not get back to that in which fateful spoke on in such manners that told of change. How is it back then upon the day of now is an interesting lens of truth that will probably always be but the utilization of reasoning interestingly enough to be back hen much more difficult compared to today especially upon the mend. The Authority must have looked both ways before the crossing and deep seated beginnings of whatever the heck reason it was going to be today for the forgotten virtues of Understanding, Love, Acceptance  and Freedom to be true would just be the start of the Ash Season and when you look upon that Ash know the sensibilities that were lost still exist in stronger form not just elsewhere but everywhere. Even this safety speaks of whatever was lost upon the past for everywhere is and not to be underestimated or misunderstood for the meanings relayed. The normality of not being attacked and receiving fairness is not just a dream but a reality and both hold power in the present. Those questions as to whether we are on course matter and direction at times is not always being communicated as true. The long hours worked of Work in the rehabilitation and therapy upon the sanctity of self has must surely past that point of need be operating upon the suffering and harm of others. I looked at it from my normal persepctive with the supporting and prime energies of such feelings and how could it be in a place past what I truly find acceptable and I can live with in multiple varying degrees. The answer intermingled with the truth of how a large portion of the Good that my Main Spirit Guides relayed feel exists and it was translated at times upon the lens of sense that discerned it to be without the events that would unfold and the experiences garnered and what whimsical blissful tragic would it be that that line forgot what needed to be remembered. How could it ever reach such a point upon shame for the past and present as well as the future to sense that failing of self and reason, that normality hidden away behind the doors of nightmare in which might exist if one is feeling that it does. To be that perspective tortured waiting for an answer from self and oh too much to handle might as well be greater good answer with the amount of resources allocated to such endeavors in certain places. God forbid we get really grimey with the skeleton truth that is to much for good civility to be able to reason. The real scare in the mix though is what exactly are we experiencing spiritually behind the scenes. Get free and never look back is best and worst of answers if the powerful true good with enough power to save most of all that is chooses not too but again those reasonings valid not too look upon the past and ask how the hell we got here in such a place? To not save is to save oneself? Is that the answer that is told on the doorstep of Good? What of Bad, What of Bad. Because it was never the answer to look towards them for the reasonings that things exist the way they do. Daydreams and illusions of reality existence, could it be true, is the answer, is there another brick in the wall? When do we get past these lines to actually see the sunlight upon the hill, Gandalf kicking ass and whatever hell else it was that was too much needed to be seen, understood and in action. When does War reveal itself and is that the answer. Hidden amongst Peace the savior of such a concept. Modern approach to things tells of spiritual wanting to live life and to be able to proceed how desired without having to worry the Rabble of dispute. Spiritual Warfare exists in many different fashions. For the Love of Red and the other colours of Blood for it was War that partially defined. The Accidents another, mistakes so said, we have found one in the mix not fated to be what it was for old story knows the truth. The Heartbreak that existed and still exists today should not be. For truths too difficult to be able to withstand the sheer veracity of rehabilitation for only the remedy will fully set free. The real one though was those not fully proceeding with the knowing of how the world can work and does in which stare upon story with love. Even if the lines written to be true there would eventually come a time when things more fully understood and how strange that today it is even less understood especially upon interaction as to what it was, the colour of blood. The bleed blue mentality of the other colours speaks of Origins and Early life in the Beginning. If you bleed yellow you might enlightened. If you bleed blue you might be sad. If you bleed purple, are you a Royal? Love speaks of Red and symbolized in the natural state in the timeframes of the past even upon those in the beginning and what poetic but War to be told as the answer for the indiscretions of the ones we love. If someone had been attacked in the beginning in the manners relayed at times in the spiritual regardless of circumstances, the circumstances themselves might have spoken about instantaneous situating from the Higher Powers that be. How is it that this is what we are rewarded with for such freedoms, the dead loved ones piled high even if not remembered to be loved from certain kind. Even if forgotten knowledge be the most important of all. How long do you stay comforted with the knowing of such truth and when do you act. All the stymied hidden amongst the ongoing something happening weren&#39;t just sitting there boils the froth of confederacy. Do we contemplate fighting amongst ourselves in such places that we have reconciled and understood to be friendly and family. I am glad. I am happy and at what point do you not feel such ways for such spiritual remedy of not known. For if it was the key question would be, who the hell would set it up that way? Seriously? Why encroach upon the mend in regards to saving. Why does it need to be but the better of the truth is why isn&#39;t it needed? Power? If there is going to a problem in regards to not experiencing getting attacked and tortured for thousands of years even collectively through a single life then why set the mend to be in the way of such endeavors. It makes no sense. The Intellects of the times have to agree do they not for such a problem to affect such spiritual who are experiencing good life upon the excuse of need be to be able to ultimately defend the entirety of what&#39;s acceptable would be too much of deterrent to put in the way of such saving. I don&#39;t believe that the most powerful of good truly need the power from those that are trying to live their live without intervening and saving. Was the middle ground, half in and half out, saving on weekends but still doing peaceful duty upon weekdays or was it the weekday warriors and peaceful sundays that needed to secure a peaceful timeframe for the sanity of mind. When was that the Original Creator just went up through his hands in the air and sort of half agree with those who wanted to live their lives peaceful without getting involved to remedy the vagabond. Fateful and Fatalistic. And then the building of normality upon something that never suppose to be normal. Spirituality. There we have an answer to the problem. But then the problem thickens but at least we have our excuse for when the Original speaks about truly still fighting finishing the fight there is meaning and truth in the mix but how could he not step sideways for those who truly not never wanted to see the winds of war. How could he not provide oasis and sanctuary upon his own for even if he ever denied there are those that disagree. When he himself get angry and when did that anger change something for you see i think he to be true good. I know it to be. So what then was it that made me feel the way that I do at times. Lost off to the side and safe and sound but when the recollection of the true beast against faith, my own faith, when does it become too much to bear seen within society and leadership to look the other way and think on the good things upon such grand direction. It&#39;s the metaphor that speaks of itself. Have we found the one. The Chosen One. You can&#39;t deny the certifiable. Even if the story that speaks of running away tells truth of how one feels it is understood that you would always still be there even if in spirit. <br><br>Themes: Literature #History #Aristocratic #Theatric #Art#Artistry #Intimacy #Love #TrueLove #Good #TrueGood #SAVINGSAVED #Saved #Protected #Defended #Hope #Clarifications #Morality #Fame #Truth #Rehabilitation <br></div>
