<div class="title">(04/01/2020) &quot;Sunshine Six&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- (On the walk into today I had talked about enlightenment and positive specifically some of the content I had been writing down in regards to the Daily Questions to the Spirit Project which might eventually be called conversations with Spirit. There was already this vindication on the Sun and spiritual energies emanating not only from the Sun but from Earth in a day in which felt to be an extension of yesterday around 7pm having a belief and idea in regards to other dimensional utilizing the sun to be able to manifest energy and food, utilization of magic and things of that nature. I had looked upon multiple photos documented online of the sun in which was vindication upon the moment I had that belief and idea that was partially facilitated by the spirit. It seemed to be that there was happenings today globally. They had brought up multiple people in which reminded of cold and cool energies. Some of these kinds of shapings have been identified to do with certain kinds of Space interplay and the coolness of Space but also cold regions in other dimensional. There have been impressions and characteristics to people I have been able to discern. Some of these impressions and characteristics lament upon spiritual aspects in many different forms. Sometimes the shaping of a person will be done deliberately with these shapings in mind and sometimes there is attachment in regards to natural shaping to a person in regards to spiritualistic aspects. This can impact incarnation at times. You see the colour of someones eyes lamenting upon a spiritual characteristic in regards to oneself that also laments upon blue karmic utilized throughout their life in which laments upon spiritual aspects of the process but also other kinds as well. That blue eyes deliberately shaped with spiritual matters in mind but then there are also those in which have naturally shaped a certain manner. In which we see spiritual lamenting upon that shaping and utilization without deliberate shaping upon that characteristic. For example, someone has dark eye shadow naturally in regards to their eyes which laments upon the Raccoon in the animal kingdom. Animal shapings in regards to human is natural at times and there is shaping machinisms behind the scenes spiritual to augment other kinds of shaping techniques that other dimensionals employ upon physical humans and physicals at times. There is also DNA shaping and augmentation as well as other genetics upon birth in which I have to realize that there is other dimensional aspects in regards to the birthing process in which could let know of other dimensional parents in regards to physicals and other dimensional aspects of self. This isn&#39;t just in regards to physical shaping and other dimensional shaping of body but also personality, behavior, mentality, mind, mindset, emotions and other kinds of characteristics and aspects. )<br><br>- (At the beginning of the day there was a let know in regards to certain aspects of Earth-Based physical and other dimensional, certain aspects in which are calling out to each other by way of communication asking if they are ok. There is an archetype situation seen within earth-based film making, the kind of speaks of wards, prisons and other kinds of situations where the patients and inmates as well as other kinds are calling out to each other to make sure they are ok, sometimes plotting strategy as well other kinds. There are other dimensional aspects of to physical earth-based humanity in which communicate through different means in which isn&#39;t always having to do with physical proximity. There are impressions of this kind of interplay and characteristics of this interplay seen in many different people that can be identified by certain traits and awareness. My other dimensional infrastructure was affected n the morning regarding. There was also a being on me this morning as well in which spoke of other dimensionals rarely seen in certain society and areas in which are becoming more frequently seen by way of some of the changes in which is a good thing. This being reminded of things told from Higher Light and Other dimensional in areas where certain kind would look at with miraculous nature but there was a tell of negative in which I still feel is more positive than not. )<br><br>- ( A tell of shaping in regards to myself earlier on, they said that the impressions if seen close enough remind of both the impression of 2020s combined in which gave that dark water and dark grey impression to myself that I had during around 2001 onward until about 2007, they tried to insinuate that an other dimensional aspects of myself had experienced those years from the 2020s and/or that there was a shaping in the 2020s pertaining. Lower octave voice, heavier and that grey black clear impression i could discern regarding. There is other conantation regarding though and a dark water impression that I would discern in regards to bags under the eyes that I still have at times and an archetype discerned in which I associate with myself in multiple ways)<br><br>Soothsaying: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9G5m17jle8<br>March 2020 Content Review Part 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFGKfQnzDvI<br>Peace Board Created: https://trello.com/b/TLKHsP5y/peace-board<br><br>- (There is let know of certain kinds of happenings in regards to Humanity, negative let know, not certain if Earth-Based was lamented or not)<br><br>- (exchange programs in regards to certain spiritual experiencing positivity especially upon the areas of low tide higher up. <br>Congicals by way of certain holodeck style dimensional access, where for a portion doesn&#39;t have to be congicals but rather experiencing stimuli just as good as the real thing in regards to immorality experiences without anyone being harmed. A portion can be congicals experiences where spiritual from higher up experience experiences with those lower down. )<br><br>- (Certain kind of creation utilization tell in regards to certain beings perpetuating turbulence and conflict, not sure in what capacity) <br> <br> (Certain kind coming around me near the end of the day before I created the Peace board on the Peacekeeperalex Trello Account, there was this air of somehow what I created had been bad but they don&#39;t know, for many they never did, what I created in the Review Content Part 3 for March 2020 was a stellar video and it was actually actions of others at times that was causing problems. Some have been wanting to utilize and have been utilizing my content creation for reasonings nefarious and excusing actions of something which shouldn&#39;t even be happening. I sat down and they tried disrupting a content experience creation in regards to some of my gaming and the beast unleashed kind of feeling although a bit different compared to the usual and fully extent of such beast. I prompted magic defense and could feel battle and it was really just a tactic to try and change ripple affect and at the same try to get me to prompt battle supposedly in an unclouth moment where mediation was taking place. Either way I would get to a point where I didn&#39;t really want to complete the day in a certain context.) <br><br>- (Line Building in regards to certain kind pertaining to rights in regards to their own content by way of the line building in this life against me and by way of me winning battles in regards to the rights of my content.<br>I am Granting those that my Main Spriit Guides indicated rights in regards to specific content that my Main Spirit Guides indicated by way of what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There are also other kinds of definitions that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and meanings that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in which I am choosing what my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding, my Main Spirit Guides are defined by my Main Spirit Guides in the Light.)<br><br>- (Big battle facilitation at the end of the night but also let knows of certain defenders not wanting to defend in which might have to do with some of the battle facilitation on this day)<br><br>Advocations: Positivity and Mediation<br><br>Activity:<br>#Other-DimensionalPertainingToPhysicalHummanityEarth-basedCommunication #Characters #Gods #Magic #Elders #SunshineSunVindicated #Space #Sheriff #Good #Cool #Sun #Stars #Positivity #RippleEffect #Happiness #Shaping #Spiritual #Earth #Interplay #Defense #Points #Matters #ProcessDirection #Story #GoodDay #Porductive #Review #Safety #CleanerEnergies #Changes #LineBuilding #Creation #Magic<br><br></div>
