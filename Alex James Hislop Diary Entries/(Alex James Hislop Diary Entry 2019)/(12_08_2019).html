<div class="title">(12/08/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity: One of the things I have seen a great amount of through observation is that of physical shaping. The idea that there is literal machinisms where certain physicals are not only shaped in the likeness of someone potentially multiple people but that some of them could be related spiritually in different kinds of ways. I have seen this to be at times metaphorically representative in different ways some of which pertains to past lives and even current lives experienced in their life behind the scenes in regards to other dimensional selves. Actors are to be true one of the professions on physical earth-based in which can be seen as an example of what I am speaking of in certain manners and probably get more views by physicals on earth-based than any other profession on physical planet earth. This makes it interesting to note some of the shapings. It&#39;s not just about life storylines although they take a decent sized portion of some of the shaping that takes place. I have seen these psychic flashes and emphasis in regards to recorded content at times like someone flashing their eyes. It will look like an emphasis in regards to a certain aspect of shaping in regards to the actors and potentially character portrayed within the film itself. This has happened on numerous occasion in which is sometimes on my side of the screen. Some of the portrayal of shapers have been as such at times that there is battle, mediation and sometimes turbulence taking place in regards to some of it in certain areas of shaping. This isn&#39;t for all of the shaping and it&#39;s certainly not the only variables in regards to certain are of shaping. Some of this happens over an extended period of time with manual shaping of facial features and body characteristics but some of it is also potentially taking place genetically. It goes further to conception at times in regards to birth and pregnancy in which does speak of relationships and form utilization. It also knocks at the door of other questions in which really do need to be answered to a certain extent. What kinds of other dimensional and spiritually activity goes on upon the sexual act and other kinds in which shape a physical human and others pertaining to earth-based. What is the incarnation variable especially when looking upon the shaping of certain physicals. It&#39;s the interesting thing that the concept of Nations upon individuals exist. Can there be metaphoricals from these nations emerge in regards to the shaping of features. What&#39;s fascinating is that it&#39;s not just physical shaping but also other-dimensional that I have noted to be influenced from the spirit around oneself. The idea that there might be these storylines that exist for a reason in which explain multiple kinds of storylines and for some only a select few. I have noted the darker side has their own storylines for some of these shapings, some in which is both acknowledge and not so by certain kind. <br><br>information Placement:<br>I am Alex James Hislop. My Main Camp is my Main Spirit Guides.

(X331)<br><br>(I have been able to feel physical stimuli and impressional life force at times specifically starting understanding this in the past couple weeks starting from that concussion in which I felt when touching another life force and exchange sometimes potential happening. I don&#39;t mean to steal life force but I feel that behind the scenes infrastructure that some are trying to harm is trying to survive. When I have been touching people I have life this physical stimuli gravitate towards me. Moving infrastructure overlapping me in which feels like I feel there is a life force in jeopardy but also attacking my own infrastructure in regards. I felt a purge happen not too long ago where some said certain kind of life force might have left me but I think they might be trying to get me to say that that the case potentially to affect certain kind of things further. )<br>(A big one talked about today had been about what exactly has been done in regards to physical media on earth based as well as others in regards to my and those that my Main Spirit Guides in the lens pertaining to that in which says that certain spiritual do not know who I am and do not know who others that my main Spirit guides indicated are in which i felt a sweeping vindication regarding in a certain manner. It was the thought that somehow there are those saying that a large portion of earth based dint know about me in which upon review of the content and what exists clearly let know there are a decent sized portion of earth the understand who i am and who those that my Main Spirit guides indicated are, it&#39;s two fold, on one hand you have a lot of good Spirit letting know about the truth even in decent ways to some but on the other you have some yelling certain kinds of lies in which there should a letting know of the truth because they may not want to utilize such resources in regards to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and some of it might be a trap.)<br><br>Themes: #Spiritualist #Spiritualism #Channeling #Cliffhanger #Competition #Hollywood #Past #Changes #Spiritualist #SpiritualismCulture #TheEvent #NotAlwaysBeingThere #TheGoodAndBadOfIt #<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.

Clickable links like the show all actions on the Peacekeeperalex trello account and attachments section where upon me clicking links shows up on my screen has been at times shoehorned into a spot where some in the spirit think that it needs to be shown in order for it to work. If I never traverse to Google.ca that doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist in the public especially the spiritually that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The data upon clicking some of those links on the peacekeeperalex trello account and the Alex James Hislop Documents on Github are public regardless of whether I click them or not, they have public links in which exist online especially in regards to the Spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. For example: https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5c28ed8f3e323f6a9f16d775/5c28edf56e82f20db23bda17/1bbaa58626a33ae318be5777687da03c/(AJHD)_the_way_my_Main_Camp_indicated.txt , that exists publically regardless of whether I click it or not. Another example is : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeacekeeperAlex/-Alex-James-Hislop-Documents-/master/(AJHD)%20AJH%20Monetary%20Creation.txt , You don&#39;t need to sign in to see any of the physical information there, you can open it in a incognito window and it will display. https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5b3546fd00481cc3f86f5b01/5c95f6df01642a7b47cefd84/5351fa2f4c120894fde5b952dd8601f2/(AJHD)_Google.txt I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for this paragraph to be placed where my Main Spirit Guides indicated daily the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. </div>
