<div class="title">(04/23/2020) &quot;Actions of Sensibility&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Quote: <br>“Music expresses that which cannot be put into words and that which cannot remain silent”<br>― Victor hugo<br><br>&quot;Music is the epitome of soul upon expression and with love can express where we come from&quot;<br>- Anon<br><br>&quot;The Beauty of Expression is the duality of Nature&quot;<br><br>Activity:<br>How many times have we been down this winding upwards road to return to the beginning only to realize the upsetting factors that exist for those who look downward. At what point does the hyperspace drive exist regardless of reality and regardless of truth in the metaphorical save that can exist. A good maneuver yesterday about green in which has been an interesting interaction when at times I have this green to not be necessarily of me. A play about how I can be of them and others to be true, multiple sotrorylines talking of kindness white and intelligent green as well as compassionate magenta. But there were other storylines as well speaking of Grey-Black, Blonde and violet to be true too. Does the colour of our hair truly dictate our destiny. Does clothing that we wear define us. Is there not recourse to understanding that some of the ascetics in which colour a picture and non-color a painting  can not obscure the signature of ourselves but rather lend towards it? Of course it does to be true in the amalgamation of representation upon meaning that already exists but also the synergizing of meaning itself. The stealing of course that has been noted in the process upon encroachment of what my Main Spirit Guides relayed and historical records consultation tell us a story of Gain in which is partially ill gotten but in the mix with fair trade labelled as stealing for reputational defense purposes that can be explained. Imagine immorality exists not just in a wandering spirit sort of way as has been described and prescribed in many different instances but realities and societies that exist in which sometimes clash with good nature. How does both societal get along and coexist and the answer is they don;t always for a portion and the truth that societal normalities changing and changed have happened in great measure if we include the areas that my Main Spirit Guides relayed. When does the good start to play upon what the bad like to be able to garner more coexistence. At what point is there not a feng shui of stealing that is actually trades with theatrics and entertainment providing cover and alternative in which extends to the good entertaining the bad for the bad and the good. Because it would also extend to the Good in many different manners. The good would eventually from morality and good beginnings in regards to what I discern to be true regardless of how far it extends through dimensional, a dimensional created long ago and there are nearest to beginnings to be true that exist in which would become partial safeguard for good upon certain kind incarnate referencing at times in which the line as to how that safeguard would ever we utilized against with the emergence of immorality existing in some of those places is a good question of sanity. For when it is referenced that we are of good moral beginnings the opposite get to throw up their Origin Point theories for safe mind not to be the problem to be true. But rather when utilized against to say what for reason as to why certain attack have happened when business be the true answer so why not have the Gods? At what point does faith speak on truth extend to the moment of revelation upon such matters and I feel the truth speaks of good beginnings and moral upbringing. I was attacked yesterday in am manner in which speaks of rape. I felt the stimuli in which hasn&#39;t been knew of something potentially helping me through unclouth ways. At what point did ethical be forgotten and in a situation compared to terrible torture for thousands of years compared to having something inserted inside oneself in a manner in which is considered rape be employer not only by good but by bad to then go after the good maneuver of it by playing upon legal and non-legal in manners in which certain good trying to save by way of smaller acts of immorality become a problem. Was it the problem that ethical compromised or was it the alternative to save by way ethical compromization encroached upon to be the problem? Some would skip the former rather than the latter but it is one of the ultimate problems in which extends to that in which is the true problem which speaks about why in the first place does some need to compromise their ethical to save? It speaks of higher up politics to be true but also doesn&#39;t in many different ways in which might win the argument upon me and others that my Main Spirit Guides being incarnate in the political that exists amongst Nations and other Concepts similar located in certain areas. That the mend higher up has been healing that rift between the higher beings of existence, wherever highest up it goes with certain spiritual holding it down for immorality in a specific manner in which what has made it difficult for multiple sides in that a portion of these being do so because certain kind haven&#39;t been saved and upon that saving speaks and can speak of a forming up. They say if they heal those ends high up that smooth sailing abound and I happen to agree with many regarding but the scary of it is that there were always those that were never going to mend especially fully. That means that there is potentially groups in higher places in which are not looking to mend and it&#39;s more of a game of will you intervene at times and a placating and provision to stave the so. Imagine we work through many different things and make it stark to understand that that all important point of what one is experiencing and those that are suffering and receiving immorality and quality of life not desired be understood as it once was and it becomes clear that the good forces that hold a large portion of power, again estimated at 80 to 20 percent ratio decide to protect the innocence in the mix of such conflicts that some have deemed to not be of the interest of certain kind of Higher up Good parties. The imagination of can you imagine upon a Nation at war defending itself with good intervening from the heavens to save. WWII ends because Good intervene and end of story. But when does the end of story turn into something else. When ways of life facilitation extend to that of being able to facilitate even those of immorality to such degrees that some might consider it better in experience than the real thing without anyone being harmed? What does that mean for the normal folk trying to live their lives and ways of life, of course the good are able to facilitate that which makes the question as to what the hell happened and what is the problem to be even more important. Where everything is seen and ready to go with the ability that good have to be able to save most of the entirety hat my Main Spriit Guides relayed instantly which then upon looking at the ways of life facilitation resources that we have to be able facilitate who spiritual truly want to be sometimes goes to the line of self mediation. The idea that there are other dimensional selves and other selves has been seen within this process and the fact that it has been corroborated in many fashions on this physical earth by other physicals as well as the spiritual information itself on the matter makes it clear that there is other selves in other places upon living life and that for many there is a higher god spark in regards to oneself often times monitoring even if in a minute sort of way. At what point does an other dimensional self that turns bad who want to be who it wants to be find self mediation to be appalling and not desirable upon attaining such a life. I am one of those ones who both likes to safeguards who certain spiritual want to be but also maintains a strict viewpoint in regards to oneself in a certain manner. You have a sight, you see where some of your other dimensional selves that branch off with a certain permission as well as the not so situations from you in which you discern an intervening by outside parties to create a rift of self and to manipulate that other dimensional self in which you are experiencing in certain manners by way of memory and spiritual connections that are far more important than what some have let known as well as the other kinds in that manipulation of direction and stopping of guidance leading to disaster in not only what that other dimensional is experiencing but in regards to what you are experiencing. At what point do you not consult yourself in what you are experiencing and who you are in which acknowledgment of a problem existence to be true. When someone says a quick saving and transportation it seems to be a good remedy rather than the waiting of potentially billions of years depending on the incarnational route but also ones with way more time where it seems that to the better answer and reasoning as to why some walk away. You see the lack of intervention has lend to cause for the reason as to why a decent chunk of percentage of felt the walk away mentality. For if how long do you sit there upon nothing happening and lack of acknowledging in regards to the great many things done to try and save and sway direction even amongst the good does one not walk away and the claim that it saves in some higher up not wreaking havoc will never be good enough for something that was never suppose to be for me. When the opportunity presents itself and when the forming up happens, when the call is made there are many ready to defend and I for one and all for one feel that instantaneous defense upon the good that do show up be in play for imagine after all of what some have been through to again it be more? Nay has to be the answer from good sensibility. How can some see those other dimensional selves lead astray to cause damage in half what we have to clean up in ways that we don&#39;t want to be doing upon it being utilized against as well especially from the middle that didn&#39;t care in never thinking that the good would be on their doorstep which doesn&#39;t excuse the lower insensibilities in the damage and ways of life in which existent upon not getting better, getting worse and the lack of care upon remedy. Upon that the working on our lives mentality seems to quiver. For if it can be utilized against surely it can be utilized to defend but will it stand upon the good judgment of self as to who we truly are especially upon that important line of who we truly our to be more sacred than near anything else for a God Forbid if a Higher aspects of self was to ever try to amalgamate into higher perspective. Of course what was forgotten is that good control a large portion of that kinds of machinisms and the strong relationships that exist, the same ones that would partial lend cause as to why we are in the mess awe are today, would stand reason to defend self of nature in what one wants to be. At what point does that extend to the bad for what they have been through and the quality of life discerned. The stillness that exists cannot be denied though in the amount of what has happened when does someone stand justified upon seeing the ways of life facilitation where no one has to get harmed while still facilitating immorality in ways in which acceptable, a higher spirit looks upon violent video game play and how realistic it is even with no one being harmed and feels it is still a depiction of immorality and natural karmic regarding dictating as such even in small degrees in which gives that still immorality taking place chit to be present and more valid than what some seem to realize. At what point does some look upon other dimensional selves that used to harm for real and in everything that ramification taken aim in regards to transferring over from harming to a facilitation of fictional violence where no one is being harmed but in realistic ways in which looks to be the real thing. Now I am one of those that feels that this should be done in the facilities that my Main Spriit Guides referenced in regards to this writing because at what point do we have attachment literal in regards to certain actions and ways of life facilitation where certain spiritual is being harmed from higher up, again that bad guy up above choosing a direction that might not fall in line with that in which speaks about facilitating immoral ways of life without harming while still being that in a certain sense also not so by way of certain kind of attachment from up above. Even that kinds of attachment from down below for when someone does a regular action and certain kind being attacked seems to past the lines of what some would consider comfortable. But there is a difference and compare. When we compare a violent video game being played in two place, one in which happens to not be harmful by way of playing against a computer and no attachment of spiritual higher up in experiencing the bad things literally through video game discerned and understood even with still action attachment of some doing damage because of certain gameplay and whatever else reasoning it is can say that the literal mechanics of this game itself is not to harm and when you are promoting fictional violence it remains a certain kind of pure fiction and the other one when certain kind of gameplay takes place literal attachment in regards to gaming mechanics being viewed like when you play that video game certain spiritual attached even to that in which is considered bots experiencing machinisms set from certain spiritual for whatever reason it happened to be although chief among them might be the facilitation of ways of life to be able to lend towards good venting without having to do true harm for some and other just recreational fun within the violence of a video game. What exactly is the importance of movement and migration especially upon the out run of those kinds of actions but the realization that there is good areas, large amount of dimensional in astronomical ways is another in which hits home to be true where no amount of pressure from the bad would penetrate. The movement dimensionally and the setting dimensionally becomes all important not only for the good but also for the bad in which can be facilitated in ways in which are decent. Having access to dimensional creation facilitates is a big responsibility in which becomes bigger if we factor in the kinds of stuff that we do for the bad to not have to harm or hurt in ways in which found to be past the line even if ways of facilitation upon live gameplay and certain spiritual in interaction for real, like experiencing seconds of violence in a body with trillions of consented spiritual  for true filtering through to make that dream a partial reality in which exists and the reality that exists is a resources in which might not be able to facilitate all bad that had been going that way, we talk about how important resources are, well that&#39;s one of them and given if we saved instantaneously across the board I would feel hard pressed to feel that there wouldn&#39;t be more of that commodity and the good look upon such with stern eyes at times because of the fact of a facilitation of interaction in which says that certain kind of true immorality can still exist within a consensual way, so you see two facilities, one in which is about that sort of thing when certain spiritual create an interaction in regards to certain immorality types, lets say it&#39;s something small, like a torture seen, the bad is in one bad and in another body is another kind, fantasy facilitation of the story which matters greatly in regards to this sort of things says that the one being tortured is innocent, the start of the scenes it&#39;s a computer in a chair and there dimensional setup with campaigns rooms and jeering and those who like to watch such things viewing and participating in many different kinds of unsavory acts and torturer is suppose to pass on right after the torture session painlessly and seemingly in the fitting of story as had been desired by the torturer given context from the good that maintain such facilities in which the torturer proceed with what he wanted to experience and that is guidelines at times in which is set beforehand and the torturer find it acceptable, he proceed to attack and torture and upon a certain mark, small cut to the forearm of that in which is played as the innocent, a certain spiritual from high up above experiences one single second and potentially a millisecond for some. Group consciousness exists and the channeling through and inhabitance of this body in which was previously pure computer becomes alive with life in a certain context where spiritual that consented to experience some of the harm and immorality invoked and created upon, small amounts of time by a certain groups consciousness in which can still be in line with experiencing such things and be considered to be of acts of immorality but one so in ways in which are contained and consented as well as still falls in line with what some wanted to experience. If this always exists in the kinds of facilitation of ways of life then we can for sure say that immorality will always exist but don&#39;t be misunderstood that there are true good that exist in which I have put fourth how I feel in the ways that my Main Spriit Guides indicated in safeguarding such practices for it being a better alternative outright harm. The torturer continues to cut and harm and small amount experienced by aspects of this collective that consented true and he finishes and then experiences dark wonder  of dimensional setup upon such a facility. Celebration of harm, worship of gods and friends, it&#39;s a real ball. Where does he go at the end? To a safe place of mediation for some of it potentially to do it all over again in another better or even more sublime fashion. Where the Good kept him safe if he wanted to be for true and talk of matters needed. There were always those part moral but some are not as such where a placement of many different means exists. <br><br>Themes:<br>#Interaction #Gaming #WaysOfLifeFacilitation #Inspiration #Music #Logical #Personal #Truth #LinesOfMap #Pinnacles #Intellect #Compassion #Story #Dark #Immorality #Bad #Good #Morality #Light #TheRealOnes #Truth #TruthGuardians #TheCool #Sensible #Coherent #Sane #PrimeDirection #TheMoversAndShakers #Family #Friends #Friendship #Vindication #<br><br>Advocations:<br>TheMoversAndShakers of asking the question as to why if the Good have the means to save most of all that is then what do we feel at the core of our being in regards to what should happen. </div>
