<div class="title">(09/01/2019) &quot;Canada Sunglasses&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Early morning interaction turned heightened by a couple different maneuvers. They continue to try and go their way through acceleration tactics and a moving of upwards energies witnessing battle and conflict take place in which I can feel getting attacked at times, people are protected and so our certain Spirit but somehow at times I haven&#39;t felt protected and awareness changing in big cloud energies. For a moment they thought of certain gravity energies in which some were quiet. I felt attacking of overlap beings happen on regards to energy shielding and spirits both protecting but I do discern at times some defenses taking hits.<br>There are these energies at times in which I feel a smooth feeling on me in which makes me feel skinny and wonderful, shaping me that way behind the scenes. They said that they were attacking those energies eve more so I always felt them around certain people in my life, people that made me happy and love. I discerned spirits I cared about. The stimuli I felt made feel like those energies were protecting me and powerful. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides are advocating for what my Main Spirit Guides indicated for us to advocate in regards to this advocation the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br><br>Still heightened energy throughout the day. Continued big topics brought up in which we should be able to talk about and we went to the Cemetery.<br><br>All throughout the day there is these heightened energies and clashes in the sky. Something is still off though even when said it had nothing to do with me for what&#39;s acceptable. They say there are multiple systems and when I go to sask because I use to live here and previous storylines specifically in regards when I was a kid. Someone Channelled through when I was young, the energies I could feel yesterday let me know there was certain kind of channeling that reminded me of when I was younger, I would do silly things and did not know some of large channeling happening at the time, stuff like peeing in my parents bedroom, sit naked on certain windows and run around naked in these awkward mometns where some would find me and I didn&#39;t fully know what I was doing as I was like 4 or 5. I remember feeling similar energies as well these days reminding me of earlier as well. Some Spirit insinuated and scared by way of this a subtle let know but what else happened, I am not certain. They said they attacked me again and that in certain moments they did so while I was in a certain younger form. I am not certain this has to do with me or if it was another aspect of Anti-Camp or Pro-Camp pertaining to my process. Either way I dont feel it&#39;s not important just because there is worse things out there And i also don&#39;t want people being attacked for such things when I feel some might have been forced to do those things to me in regards to certain aspects of the spirit when I was younger. <br><br>One the talking points today has been God Spark splitting and perspective stealing as well as other kinds where some are told that there anticamps got attacked in a certain way in which then some reveal later on that the Anti-Camp working against you that got harmed was actually you in which you were forced to work against yourself in which in the mix some are also trying to utilize in a certain fashion to get some in trouble in which a combining after is said to have not been but rather an aspect of yourself rather than your Anti-Camp for real. So escapes at times is the disparities and lines in regards to this in regards to anticamps and how we view them and desensitization regards in which can be difficult as well upon knowing what kind of anticamps are operating like one as in which some wouldnt want to help by way of the intent and motivation of some. So combing these lines, 1) Are some of us being split and aimed at ourselves in regards to anticamps utilization in which there are potentially attacks only to recombine then say it&#39;s not attacking us? 2)  Are some using the previous point and confusing upon certain combing 3) So what if they don&#39;t combine, combine or are not an aspect of yourself and why should we still care 4) In the !is there are some we have to be wary of and that kind of stuff where some motivation and intent is truly not decent. 5) a let know that there are some that do want to experience certain kinds of immorality in the spirit.<br><br>I felt certain reviews happen and others upon going to Auntie Sherry&#39;s. I was able to do certain Advocations thoughout just as I have been doing on this trip. Reviewing certain information in front of my family to try and help, emphasis in regards to family stuff. <br><br>There was another reveal at the end of the day that ain&#39;t too surprising as I do discern something there to exist that Ken Hislop was innocent in which some tried to setup but I am not certain it&#39;s what some think.<br><br>There has been an emphasis in regards to two different systems, multiple different systems where some are bad guys on one side and good guys on the other where upon coming to sask there was a switch off. I Discern one of the big differences to be open energies in regards to sask and more overlap bubbles in regards to where I am located in Georgina. Some of the high impact stuff though today that I was aware of like thinking about towns, kisby this clean crisp smooth energies, quick and weyburn has a long winded feeling like almost a rea tion to kisby but upon further reflection iweybjrn too has some energies similar to kisby in getting smoother over the years. The kind of inflict I am talking about an obviously spirits can point towards other events at times that have happened on regards to some of this stuff but it still happens to be at times where upon my actions that something takes place like thinking about a subject thatis impacted by that thought and others.<br><br>I need to emphasis the kind of events taking place and the gravity of the situations at times. One of the things mentioned was checking items that are suppose to be there, there was big moment where I felt someone higher up, multiple doing checks. Another one had to do with certain earth-based events for some of it and let knows that there was a percentage of Earth where attacks were trying to have happen and not necessarily on my end. In fact there has been certain events where it just feels like some big my energies up and play it a certain style. Some of it has to do with not affecting certain below in which I am wondering bout the spiritual comparison in regards to Ontario and sasktchewan. <br><br>We went to the graveyard and they brought up cemeteries and graveyards and the contrast between the wordings as well as meanings. Skeleton Fiends and energies of the dead. I think there suppose to work together and do in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I woke up the dead a bit upon entering that place and I am not certain I meant too. I felt there to be connection with the tombstones and the kind of stuff where I would place my hand on a tombstones and feel energies.<br><br>Kisby, weyburn, Carlisle, Estaevan, <br><br>#Cats #Lovers #Graveyards #Cemeterys #Reviews #Fighting #Utilization #Purity #Care #Climate<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
