<div class="content">Activity: <br>It&#39;s been silent to a certain degree. I have been noticing certain things happen, one of which was a psychological release in regards to being given certain answers in regards to head area but yesterday, I did feel like I got attacked in multiple kinds of way but I think certain spirits want me to write certain negatives down in regards to certain things. Today one of the talking points on my end was certain spirits wanting people to continue to bring certain negatives in regards to potentially let know of and create a certain kind of mindset in regards to emerging defenders and spiritualists. Another topic point that was let know was that of certain spiritual happening around myself pertaining different kind of emergences, dimensional placement, partially by way of breaking through that sort of thing yesterday but it was talked about and thought of try an open sort concept kind in a certain kinds of way.  Psychictivty understanding in regards to our beings, certain peoples and spirits being on the Radar regardless, like the scenes from X-Men when Professor X is seeing mutants and regular folk, how that imagery happens except much more advanced  to facilitate other-dimensional needs. Imagine walking through life and there being certain aspects of yourself both conscious and unconscious aspects are able to identify peoples, spirits and beings behind the scenes and in front of the scenes. Like being able to walk down a street and in the physical not know certain people on that street but a part of yourself knowing some of them if not all of them. A fog lifted and an awareness understood. Some of it here and there while other areas the fog is completely gone and it&#39;s understood who certain people are in a certain kinds of way. Imagine that there are seemingly specials and supposedly not soes being seen in those areas where the fog is lifted here and there. Certain peoples you may have seen your life, hundreds of years, thousand of years if not millions or billions of years, potentially more where some people were seen, sense and understood from a far through the Fog and others(defined by my Main Camp).<br>The knowledge and differences between thing not having to matter, systems being employed in regards to that mentality as well the idea that the other course might be beneficial in regards to going a certain that could considered beneficial. Certain areas and dimensional existences where actions truly do not matter and there is for what&#39;s acceptables but also the difference between the mindset and the utilization of that falsehoods pertaining to create harm by way of espousing that defense does not matter. <br><br>Themes: #Failure #Situating #Success #Time #Story #Conversations #LongGame #ShortGame #MidGameProtection #Missions #Earth #Luna #Physical #Bigs #Smalls #MediumSized #ElderBeings #YouthBeings #MediBeings #Black<br><br>Advocationals: <br>White Truth that my Main Camp indicated (February - March, 2019) <br>Those Prophets that my Main Camp indicated (February - March 2019 ) <br>The Heroes that my Main Camp indicated (March 13th, 2019)<br>Specifics X100 advocations in regards to Essential advocations especially in regards to personal Augmentation and actional attachment in regards to my Actions, Non-Actions, etc.(defined by my Main Camp)<br>Situating certain safety pertaining to conflict especially in regards to Elder breings (Like some might be peoples that were fighting but were actually friends and then it&#39;s revealed that there was some elders, etc. feng shuing them to fight.)<br>Communications and Transportation in regards to dimensional sleeves hat venture above my head in which are usually interacting with myself.
