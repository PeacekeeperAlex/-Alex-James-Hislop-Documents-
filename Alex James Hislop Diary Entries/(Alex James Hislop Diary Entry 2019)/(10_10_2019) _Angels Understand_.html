<div class="title">(10/10/2019) &quot;Angels Understand&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- Early morning happening after watching Batman (1992) in which there was this surreal moment with talking points that had been said in 1992 as to what was happening in 2019. Banner and Nation related stuff had been happening. Certain spirit on the move and a big reveal and shake up in regards to the spiritual on my end which usually reflect a portion of earth based and at times others as well although again the past couple days there has been emphasis in regards to moving infrastructure from me in certain manners forming up in process alternatives in the areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There was a scene that really reminded me of some of the current situations where Catwoman asked Batman if they needed to fight now and he responded with &quot;Lets take this outside.&quot; In which really feels like certain kind have been forming up to a certain extent. I explained certain key points and so did spirits in regards to this dialogue with the past and that there are some that are in battle in which vents taking place in Higher Light and in other parts of the Light. <br><br>- Earlier yesterday I felt a certain kind of other dimensional stimuli that shocked certain spirits around in regards to certain streams coming out of certain areas in my bodies most notable my lower body and private areas in which I felt a purity afterwards but like something was missing. it ended up reappearing later when I went to bed in a certain manner.<br><br>- A really amazing spirit came around me in a certain fashion. Intimacy invoked in multiple kinds of ways and I felt like it was something else as well. Certain kind of interaction took place. Then certain stimuli took place and a placement of eyes on me when my eyes like certain like looking at me looking at the dark of my mind. Then the eyes combined with mine and some turned to look outward a decent sized percentage if not more. There was something with intimacy in regards to these eyes but also something else. <br><br>- I decided after enough tossing turning to look towards angelic light. There was a reason but I forgot what exactly happened. I looked towards a bronze golden water kind of light and a yellow-golden light as well. I then looked towards similar light towards Belle my sister. I felt multiple updates and changes, deployments as well as some leaving. <br><br>- I also looked towards an angelic light and multiple angels stemming fourth to protect. There was moment where I felt some had insinuated that there was Angels deploying in a large fashion. I did feel a spirit of angels upon myself specifically insinuated an other self to be an angel or at least a friend. I felt wings and feathers and angelic impression and an update and situating regarding my behavior. <br><br>- I felt there was multiple kinds of interaction and it felt like at he bad spirit were overwhelmed. Because multiple other parties came over in a certain regard, this was after the Angelic feeling in a certain regards partially because of how Angelic operate in a certain manner. <br><br>- Sleeping most of the day.<br><br>- changing gender to female Explain Gender infrastructure correspondence, certain kind of updates and attacks in regards to me changing genders to female, female also potentially attacked. <br><br>- Earth conflict, banners conflict, flotilla happenings, movement of more qualities, emphasis in regards to certain good being more removed from certain physicals. <br><br>- Small argumentative about certain spirit leaving my home, emphasis and upsetness that I did not focus on advocations<br><br>- Eyes and the tell of information or at least trying to have happen of a certain kind. <br><br>- Smooth kind said to be leaving and also trying to work against myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in a certain context partially by way of banner utilization and stimuli utilization to cover what was really attacking. Some kind helping me from future long game in a certain context partially by way of some of the implosions of direction happening in certain areas. <br><br>Dream:<br>- This time the dream in the day happened to be about a certain kind of school. A spirit joked about a school against Alex as well another kind being certain kind of learning and education in regards to certain societal against but I think this might not be true. I think some might want a place like this to be labelled to be and actually I think it was of the good guys in a certain context and if it wasn&#39;t then that is some smooth feng shui, either way I felt like I was amongst them and that it was a recovery area. There was students milling about at tone point earlier in the dream and there was even a running area. At one point I looked towards this platform that high up in the air. Dreamland, specifically this place, they say that some of the students never saw they saw a board and on a board in regards to what I had done it was mostly red, revealed that I never did those things that were listed which changed a situation. I woke up and we had multiple discussions regarding and it was crazy to have potentially a place in dreamland pop up as normal as that so said to be against me and others if certain variables had been true but it also looked to be having it&#39;s own circumstances to protect itself. Like some might not have gone that route had certain kind been given the resources needed discretely. (Explain some of the dark within dreamland and how that can coincide with the light at times.)<br>- Earlier on I had a dream where I was buying certain kinds of products from a wagon inside a school. It was a certain place for certain kind in which had negative feelings at times. There was dark about this dream but there was a closed down feeling as well like this potentially had already been closed down. There was also a certain kind wanting to let know that there lives changed and not necessarily for the better when a certain closed in the spiritual and potentially dreamland. There is an emphasis in regards to this one in regards to certain kind being innocent, it didn&#39;t look that way in the dream pertaining to energies but it is being told that that might be the case in a local sort of way. <br>- The other dream I saw there was someone playing a game of Cat and Mouse. There was letters with something to do with the periods at the ends of sentences. Like an emphasis in regards to beauty marks but also something to do with mouse. Picnic bench of a person reading a letter and trying to track down certain kind in which some said for me to stay away from but really spiritually i don&#39;t know if that is visable for some of my other selves. <br><br><br>Informational Creation: <br><br>- in regards to the Events that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to October 10th, 2019, Events that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to October, 2019, Earth Angels, Earth-Based Angels (AJH Daily Defensives - x30)<br>clarifications pertaining to what is Alex James Hislop&#39;s and what is not<br>Advocationals:<br>in regards to Sleep Teams that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and Awaken Teams that my Main Spirit Guides indicated<br>Updates that my Main Spriit Guides indicated in regards to October, 2019 and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides)<br><br><br>Themes: <br>#Angelics #Angels #Peace #Prosperity #Recovery #Sleep #Battle #Conflict #EarthConfrontation #Labelment #FormingUp #Events #History #ShakeUps #CommunityService<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
