<div class="title">(10/09/2019) &quot;Not so Silent&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- Yesterday early morning after staying up most of the night there were some spirit that were keeping up coupled with me being fairly wired. The discussions ranger from small talk and even comedic banter as well as bringing up some of the same subjects I have been talking about, Original Creator and certain kind of discussion in regards to the amount of negative in regards to some of us along with what is was we actually did. They brought certain dimensional infrastructure around me at a certain point in time that in which I have labelled the Nova. There was also said to be certain kind of gaming interaction happening as well. At one point there was a vision of someone knocking on a females door. As the door opened the scene changed to reflect two female and a male. The two female kissed and it was said that there lips got locked and then a light appeared with saw kind venturing outside of the Light so said to help the two female but really it looked liked something else. Throughout it there was said to be events taking placed in a chain which was higher up in regards to both my incarnational train and process alternatives. Some trying to move certain infrastructure and qualities  as well as traits away from myself and go towards a different place to be able to facilitate some of the things happening in a different area. Then there was a let know that certain kind in regards to a culture I have labelled trene, blue banners and water smooth woke up in a way in which had them check other kinds of aspects. A certain kind said they were leaving and going upwards, some of them status quo and earlier there was this scene like a bunch of good spirit trying to get certain bad spirit but in a certain manner in which kind of felt like some of the bad spirit were still going to be hanging around. Either way I defended myself in multiple kinds of ways one of which was by opening lights by way of spiritual defense and the fact that we can look towards the light during times o spiritual trouble. There was also a deflection I think in regards to Banners, I think some were going a direction to try and change the tone of the conversation but one thing that was brought up was Solvenia and how they are a portion of my Authorities. When we look at it from banner perspective and how the kinds of disparities at times not even spoken of in regards to banners and the kind of weighted card that pull has. Because there has been banners pretend to be my friend and pretend to be defending me when they were not and I only want the protection and defense that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Either way I woke up to devastated energies and big dimensional movements with large spotlight upon me but really the spotlights were upon those that my Main Spriit Guides indicated pertaining to October 8th, 2019 and October 9th, 2019. Something happened when I went to bed and some were saying it was a decent thing me staying up last night and I feel that it was in multiple regards to be quite honest it got less to do with what took place yesterday. Myself and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) did nothing wrong to bring fourth whatever the hell energies have been hanging around today and yesterday. <br>- Some of things spirits have been doing is facilitating and taking away an anger and upsetness in regards to myself in which doesn&#39;t seem to of moral nature but rather of something else. We will see, check it upon the books that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>- Some said that if I didn&#39;t take this life that somehow there would be multiple attacks, spiritual communication letting know of that and there is something about it with all of the things understood and known but the events taking place in the spirit kind of makes that let know not make sense. Research this spirit that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. Reveal the information that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the moments that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>- I proceeded in a different way in getting some of my recreational and work done today. starting off with advocations. <br><br>Informational Creation:<br>Understanding Trene, Optfithus, Azmodus, Ankor and Ri (AJH Daily Defensives - x30 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br>Trene, Optfithus, Azmodus, Ankor, Ri (AJH Daily Defensives - x30 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br>Motivation in regards to Solvenia, Truth in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, God Spark Recovery in regards to Earth (AJH Daily Defensives - x30 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br>Events that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to October 9th, 2019<br>Mine and others(defined by my Main Camp) Defense works as well as the displaying Technology that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, Personnel that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, Spirit Recovery that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, God Spark Recovery that my Main Spirit Guides indicated (AJH Daily Defensives - x30 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br><br><br><br>Working on reputational defense in regards to the routes that I choose specifically in regards to truth revealed. Specifically in regards to how I chose this life. <br><br>Ideas:<br>The disparities in regards to Art, firing back within content experience pertaining to Art and even responding with Art looked in regards to negative and positive art being perpetuated in regards and that desensitizing line in regards to positivity being done towards those that don&#39;t want to experience that or have that be done in regards as well as that desensitizing line in regards to responding certain kind upon having negative being perpetuated in regards and how some view that negativity being drawn in a different light like somehow it&#39;s ok or ignored in regards to how one feels in regards to negative happening based upon responding. Informational Creation. (ART)<br><br>The attacked infrastructure in regards to myself and the saying that somehow earth-based physical need to take the brunt, when there really is no case against me physically anyhow. Infrastructure like food mechanisms, dimensional infrastructure that felt like it used to be part of me being attacked in other dimensional, ruptures and the ailments regarding, the resources and those experiencing that infrastructure upon it being attacked as well as the utilization in regards to that infrastructure. <br><br>I let know that I was a certain kind one that does not always respond in a certain fashion as is reflecting as is happening to myself spiritually, creating let know here and there in regards to myself and others. Like not always being sad when I would usually want to be sad rather than angry but that I am still angry. <br>There was a dream I had in which I saw a certain kind in third person running quickly. Like sup speed. When they stopped it looked like they were on some sort of Greenery or park. One person grabbed a Soda from a certain kind of machine. It looked like a recovery kind of mobility. <br><br>Themes:<br>#Devastation #Change #Flotilla #Dishonesty #Safety #Lies #Truth #Smalls #Bigs #DoSomething #Defense #DefensiveTone #Leaving #Movement #Deployment #Alternatives #Art #Gaming #Science<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
