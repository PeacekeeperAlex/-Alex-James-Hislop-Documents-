<div class="title">(09/28/2020) &quot;God, Angels and Old Hollywood&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I woke up and was getting scared by way of some horror antics, discerning big spiders moving from inside me and outwards, they seemed so real, some eight legged freaks stuff to be true, it was contained and there was safety regarding but I kind of freaked out and it had this put together dimensional that reminded of physical just a bit more subtle soft. A moment where it looked like I was holding some older fashion M1Grand from the 40s pointing upwards. It reminded of an aspects of the stand as well as outbreak. I prompted what my Main Spirit Guides indicated only for obvious reasonings but has been that sort of thing where I note bombings through me. I called upon multiple things, one of which hopeful to be deployed right before the outburst on my back deck. It was like I could feel perspectives at the end of their rope, hitting metal, the channel, you know when it hits metal, well I feel certain perspective at least on me in those moments were almost hitting metal. I freaked a bit in regards to Old Hollywood in which was partially in regards to beloved film that some tried to get me to lash out in regards to a specific frame regarding the Angels in Space, I knew them to be good, moral but I was upset, I was angry that I was being attacked and that somehow the lack of seeing a angelic guardians just show up and beat the bad guy in front of my eyes, even though I have noted certain moments of that sort of thing psychically but not too much. I was angry at God, I didn&#39;t know why. Then I reached in regards to old Hollywood who are innocent in regards to this and so is God and the Angels. The problem at times has been actions attachment where the good having to deal with the bad attaching through, having to deal with me and me having to deal with my own actions as well as some of the action attachment. Another thing  I called upon partially because of some of bad perception regarding some of the action attatchment regarding myself was for the Good to reach through me and have that spice of Good actional attachment acknowledge even if in pressurized manner on those moments intense. Near a day previous, early morning 27th of september, 2020 I had a really positive experience with those Angels or at least what seemed to be those angels. Similar voice works channeling through, the stars and Angelic speaking through stars discerned as well. It was one of the best interactions I have experienced thus far. Later today though caught at a bad time and brought up in certain fashino when I was under attack spiritually and certain spiritual scaring me, one of the bad things in regards to when I went to the Angels in the Stars in the frame in that movie, I had noted earlier there was certain impressional and do note that spiritual and other-dimensional can manipulate impressional placement to reflect something in which not everyone is seeing but also on my side of the screen alone rather. I had only prompted what my Main Spirit Guides indicated but I felt bomb and anatomical regarding near my hand areas. I have said in multiple manners for my interaction to be set the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. They had said that the action attatchments might have been good and rather certain spiritual working through me to counter others that were trying to harm. Some dont realize how much the turning and twisting of those who are of Good is affecting certain variables and the damage done is not helping the good at times. Anyhow, the cops showed because I had been screaming and crying in my backyard. I took an ativan to calm down and they were nice enough but I did some advocations within my mind to try and help especially given the clarifications regarding spiritual guideship as of late Specifically for the spiritual and other-dimensional reading this novel, you should hear some of the events that had been happening corresponding with on my end the past couple days and as to why this manipulation took place. There is both good and bad regarding some fo the manipulation that has happened regarding me. I dont know if Old Hollywood, the Angels and God were requesting assistance in regards to that time frame of the 40s partially specific in regards to September 2020, I am not certain. With all of that talk in regards to having it have happens by way of even mentioning certain things, meaning clarifications regarding that phenomenon have been present on my end in large fashion but also other kinds as well too. One of the things was some trying to set my psychictivity to reflect like there is less spiritual in vicinity when there still is a large amount of spiritual around me in many fashions and there was this peak behind the covers as to what it really is with spiritual descending from the wings like some sort of sting remembered. There had been some trying to say certain bad had been deploying spiritually within the past week or so and I did discern as such in certain manners but there was lot of good around me and there was also cards pulled from myself and the good in certain manner. Not all bad are bad though and we need to be protecting that bad too especially given the memory manipulation conundrums that had been let known to have been happening with memory manipulator and manipulatees so said good turned bad in certain manners. It might be as dire as described but there has been a thing about it. Myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated are advocating for what my Main Spirit Guides chose for us to advocate in regards to Old Hollywood, Angels and God the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br><br>I ended up hitting home in regards to certain content, did advocationals and wrote in my diary which fro some felt to be decent. For such scary moments at times in the morning the turn around of the day especially after going for a walk and watching some media then following with a content that felt different really made me feel like I can live this life. It made me feel good to be able to  speak that way, it was almost provocative in a certain manner having to do with being able to speak more in manners societal acceptable cause I could feel the kind of interaction system around me and there was this shout to earlier diary entries more pure when I was more younger and not partially aged for the past couple years and I had wondered what my 2014 younger self would be like in comparison to me today and me in 2018. I think the answer is that the comparison of the four year difference would also see something similar with comparison of today to just two years ago. More youthful, more free. It was like I had learned in this process about certain things that had made me feel like i had been through something. I feel like my younger selves before 2016 especially after 2015 with the crazy events and psychic emergence would say something akin to the former sentence without fully knowing some of the experiences that had happened. I had wondered if my self around 2008 after learning how to love would seem the younger as well compared to who I would be in 2014. It was a romanticism of age and self as well as reflection. I had been so stuck at times in this past five years time zone of somehow forgetting that I had a life before. Dont get me wrong, I loved my process, it scared me in many fashion sometimes decent but there was also something about it. Like somehow watching movies and playing video games wasn&#39;t enough to fulfill in ways that I understood as remembrance was strong as it is today as it was yesterday. I was afraid life, still to be true and I always felt like something was missing. I know I want to be a psychic, my younger self in the tent trailer with candle sacred asking guideship to be a psychic even before 2008 when still a young teenager reminded me of youthful perception of what it was to be a true psychic. Of what I wanted it to be. What I know it my heart that it was for my younger selves. They wouldn&#39;t be subjected to whatever the hell was wrong with this process nowadays. <br><br>Tells of good operation to be true. Of course there was debate as to whether that be Origin or Not and of course it was not really spoken of in loud enough  Even with the sticky paint thought to be maybe on the bed sheets, like some tacky overused message in the hopes without the horsehead upon linens. The true true was that it might have been an other-dimensional catch. They have brought it up before, certain spiritual brought up before certain kind of technology having to do with photographical of spiritual in motion, often times in this context I feel slow motion be the normal. Like imagine a fly trap tape, but instead of flies there was other dimensional and the tape itself easily situatable in which didn&#39;t harm other dimensional but rathe utilized to resituate. This paint slick I ended up just going to bed bed in feeling this thought to be message of blood. I have felt it before, I ended up going to bed before, was it I, the abnormal average psychic citizen supposed to be the one to clean or was it supposed the Good, the true Good? The True True Good? I felt spiritual layers upon the sheet. I even checked the bare bed and didn&#39;t  feel the energies that I felt on the sheet, it was like I could feel three dimensional larger tucked away in a single bed spread. That there was thousands and hundreds of thousands maybe even millions and billions if not more so within one single layer and God I hoped that Paint was good, one of the good ones that resituated. <br><br>Memory this day, feels like a hard platform on my head near the end of the day near the hopes of some gaming streams and excitement in regards to societal resources that makes one feel good. I felt compressed and cut off to be true from certain spiritual, first a certain kind of discernment in regards reflecting like somehow there not there when I know them to be, I could it in my bones. Then certain kinds of energies seemingly cut off from me in which I feel I was still connected. I mean there was moments where i could literally feel the sky and of course it wasn&#39;t that at times that I couldn&#39;t feel that. I had wondered though what the hell else now. It was always something. Some sort of deep blue float. Some dark Halloween night with blue light. Some kind nightmare in the mornings with a god forbid he doesn&#39;t freak out. The normal wake upon with taste of sock and shout to the average smoe he didn&#39;t realize the kind of it really was, not just some normality that had nothing to do with the spirit. Of course I knew better and sometimes it made it worse. The kinds of experiences in regards to morning seemed to be a certain kind of measure to meet the masses even if the masses woudln&#39;t admit it. At what point did it reach massed to the point the where they would and dont mistake to think I was looking for that but rather discerning if there was bumpy in the morning. I wasn&#39;t talking about sex. It wasn&#39;t this early morning delight lovely. The taste of scum in the mouth seemed to be spark reality of the situation. <br><br>Thought so physicals passed on and there was this kind of look of how some spiritual try to say there far away when some of them are so close. They can literally dance with us. Take a walk down the street and for a quick moonlight minute in the mix you could be dancing with a physical passed that you cared about. Thank you for smoking but the real true had less ads even with the substance of such. </div>
