<div class="content">Activity:<br>I went to Newmarket for a second time. The bud ride was quiet but I could feel a culture of regular banner stuff around receiving healing and information.<br><br>Discussions about a spiritual and other dimensional utilization of archetype noted through impressions, psychic flashes and shaping. Certain kind of hungry spirit letting know of something. The shaping was a cross between myself but also that gangster aspect. There is also those that have indicated a certain group has been doing aggressive maneuvers in regards to other dimensional overlaps and placements of dimensional regarding food pertaining to different archetypes as has been noted in my process but that at times this archetype on my end noted has been associated in multiple manners, some of which having to do with food but nonetheless there has been multiple times noted in certain kind digging the fast food ventures that I take. There had been noting that some are not being sustained through me and in other ways by way of the food and at times water in which upon going to fast food in which lends more sustenance. That might have been one of the shaping tells. That aspect is the portion that was shaped like me I feel because it&#39;s been a tell on my end already. The other aspect looked like gangster to a certain extent potentially speaking of food and resources. Continued flashing of this form periodically until I figured fairly confirmed for some of what it could potentially pertain in which some are trying to communicate.<br><br>There has been energies talked about before in regards to many manners of fashion. One of them, luster for life, a willing to want to continue on in which this muted feeling and suppression is placed and inside me in other dimensional I have felt this suppressed for me to be able to feel as well as other dimensional but that a portion is still feeling these energies. There was another energy affected in regards to myself earlier on in which had to do with fame and feeling certain entertainment life force. It&#39;s a bit different now regarding but it was situated I feel and I do note moments where there was interaction regarding having to do with situating. There has been other energy discussions as well regarding noted difficulties in different fashions. <br><br>The continued bringing up of certain kind of spiritual and an uncomfortable subject to a certain extent. The tells have been that certain kind have been harassing others with certain kind of cultural unclouths. Things in which certain physicals on this physical planet earth view to be not acceptable. In other dimensional it has been told that some of these actions are being perpetuated but certain spiritual isn&#39;t being harmed but considering some of the tells I feel there has been harm. This partially extends to days before in high impactful moments on my end in discernment of bringing up of this subject multiple by certain spiritual in different fashions. Some of it decent, other times not so. Today it was discussed in a certain manner albeit discretely in a dimensional feng shui and I do feel discussing these issues are needed to be able to work past them and certainly ignoring that there is harm taking place might not be the way considering the amount of damage at times. There had been spoken clean resources that certain good societal in a facilitation of bad without anyone being harmed kind of way and there had been moments where certain kind didn&#39;t know what to do with it by way of the kind of treatment at times and if it isn&#39;t clean resources in a certain sense then I am asking for the Authorities to step in, in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I don&#39;t feel I have been the problem and I have continued to say that I want spiritual and people as well as other kinds if not considered a part of previous groups to be protected, so why wouldn&#39;t this extend kind of subject matter. It should also be understood the kinds of energy placements and things of that kind upon certain spiritual in which has been invoking a direction that some do not want to go, why is this happening at times? The answer to be true is that at times there is darker things than some of what we understand to be certain immoral actions unthinkable. What is the Remedy? No remedy at all can&#39;t be the answer, can it?<br><br>Suppression of feeling in regards to myself and other overlaps like the clear watery eyes stare off in the distance kind of stuff. Emotions. Different kinds of feelings as well in which I don&#39;t feel need to be suppressed but might be by way of certain circumstances, Emotion is one of those ones in which I find I want to be able to feel. <br><br>There was movement dimensionally in new market in a certain context and I noted different signs pointing towards direction. Story tells throughout on the bud and a spirit of story coming around and helping. <br><br>Suppression of being able to feel some of the experiences that I am feeling at times physically but also this phenomenon existing in regards to other-dimensional at times notably within process as of late. <br><br>That look that we saw within a film and noted in other characteristic shapings telling of psychological and influencing regarding in which there is multiple connotations I am not fully able to identify as to whether they are good or not. <br><br>Certain spiritual already put into play certain manners in which alleviate ways of operating on my end physically and spiritually as well as in regards to others that has been beneficial albeit given a certain kind of hit. it&#39;s the kind of thing where spiritual maneuver in a certain manner in which I would want to be able to fully endorse and more so but have been unable due to circumstances.<br><br>Informational exchanges especially that in which of those spiritual that are giving tells regarding and the kind circumstances they are under  in which should be understood to be able to help them. and ways we can create further karmic given context.<br><br>The information being seen on this diary at times has been on certain infrastructure and other-dimensional net, for good reason at times, in which has been helpful, which to be true for the physical wording on my diary entries is not too much over the lines in a certain sense but in regards to other dimensional. I am wondering what connotation and direction is going regarding. <br><br>There has been talk of gangsters at times. For me, I feel there has been a spiritual getting attacked reputationally in unfair ways that I am hoping for remedy, it does matter and some of them are not the same, meaning that some don&#39;t mind doing outlandish things to save or help but that there is portions of which are not and do not want to be mixed up in mistaken to be the same. Earlier I had a though in certain dimensional, that I want to protect to mimic actions up above in gangster style that corresponds with actions below defending those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. In fact there are others who feel similar and would want discussions of mimicking from higher dimensional and light but also in the middle realms and middle dimensional for lower down. Many of us wish for this not be misused in certain fashions to try and have spiritual be going those routes but there is also an asking from some that have been getting attacked to certain points to be able to defend themselves in such fashions.<br><br>Explaining why it is that certain things are the way they are has been seen and a mending happening alongside at times and the tell is that there is explaining happening and working towards less attack at times spiritually behind the scenes and in front the scenes and at level. <br><br>Communications for some have been cut off at times in which they are feeling a certain way. It&#39;s interesting that life utilization alleviates some of this especially given communication that exists between the life and the life utilization at times. I think some feel that they still want be a part of certain processes but alleviating resources seems to help.<br><br>-<br>Light existences located lower down. <br>Dimensions<br>-<br>Canada - Nature<br>Ireland - Food Deployments</div>
