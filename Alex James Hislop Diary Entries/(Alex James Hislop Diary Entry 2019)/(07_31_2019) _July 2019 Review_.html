<div class="title">(07/31/2019) &quot;July 2019 Review&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>- There was multiple kinds of discussions yesterday upon going to be. One of the storylines brought up is how some thought Jamie hadn&#39;t been around in a certain context, thoughts that she was bad and even extending to higher up baddies was thought, that she could be of a certain kind was insinuated not that there is anything wrong that. I felt that even if that is this case that she might be her own person I feel she will choose what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Just because she has seemingly not been around at times doesn&#39;t mean she isn&#39;t helping a times or doesn&#39;t care as well doesn&#39;t mean she isn&#39;t trying to pitch in, 1) not all operate in that fashion of showing up at times in certain context that some were insinuating, 2) she might have been around in multiple capacities at times without some knowing, 3) there are moments throughout were she might have been around that is noted 4) life utilization regarding can create multiple kinds of different looks, 5) certain Long Game kind of styles might look different than what some are used too <br>- The next thing I would watch would be Bad Blood. There was linking of this series partially with Sons of Anarchy earlier when I did multiple advocation in regards to certain actors partially by way of certain turbulence in which took place.<br>- There has been a thing with Hollywood when two days ago I brought up heavenly content experiences and how certain heavens have created content experiences in regards to earth based content, not that unheard of to a certain extent and wouldn&#39;t be too out of the blue but I brought up the percentages of earth based physical human population that are comfortable with heaven content experiences in the context of what my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated as well the potential that there is at least a frame in some of earth-based content in the content itself in which lets know this some of this content. There was a realization and movement in regards to it. There was this discernment of different energies associated with film and how strange that the filmmaking itself for some can be thought to be related to the energies especially in regards to colours. I discerned a link between breaking bad as well as Sons of Anarchy.<br>- When I started watching Bad Blood there was thought that some of the events that happened when I watched first season, in which I can now discern through memory there was higher up energies that reminded of some of the turbulence of the day previous but different to a certain degree but still a connection. Some of the turbulence yesterday might have also been certain conflict in regards to film and Hollywood as well as others.<br>- There has been this discerning of conflict in regards to Film Industries on my end stemming from Game of Thrones, it was the first time I looked at Hollywood and film industry in a certain light. It&#39;s again been discerned at times throughout certain content experiences in different light throughout my experiences with film that there are some outside influences trying to influence our films, now some of it I have discerned to be decent in multiple regards, off planet film industries that try to help at times and some of this might even extend to other physical planets but I am uncertain. There has been apparent though that some are trying to impact and steal as well as hurt Earth-Based physical in regards to our physical content. I have noted this in multiple kinds of ways.<br>- Jesus  was brought up multiple times today and one thing that was let know is that you don&#39;t want to be attacking biblical impressions as they have strong case. Those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated did not do anything wrong. It tied into regards life utilization difficulties in which some have continued to let know of and relay that the reason some of cannot extend portions of our lives at times is the utilization in regards to the which the subtlety in regards to that pertaining to bad life utilization has been revealing more so daily in regards to some. Which can be facilitated some of it in regards to the Systems that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>- There was moments upon today as well in which pulled from film in which then connected to certain moments within my life. Biblical and Realism in which some of them combined in which was also relayed that White and Black, some of them Combined as well to make Grey. A certain realism and story in which I felt Green of Story get healed as well. Creating a force in which connected to Caveman impressions in which also reminds me of Beige in regards to certain Stone. It brought to the attention that blue vs grey indicating certain baddies in regards to a kind of conflict.<br>- There potentially needs to be subject change and Segway information in regards to my Father and others that my Main Spirit Guides to be able to operate in a certain fashion as well in which tied into Quality and Trait Mechanism woes in which at times have been happening. We need to listen and proceed the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this planet. Life utilization ties into this. It was then thought of in regards to something in which linked Trene and Azmodus together in which they might be on the same side. Azmodus at times has reminded me of Gold banners and Yellow Banners. Azmodus also remind me of certain Original Creators especially the golden-yellow kind. Trene has remind of Blue Banners. They say that certain banners are of a certain kind in which remind me of the Concept Banners. I do perceive their to be good amongst but there is also conflict in regards to the emergence of the intervention that is needed to be able to protect those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Earlier in Story brook moment in my life during 2015 the let know that there was conflict in regards to two colours. It linked something and somehow some thought that some of the bad guys might be pink or gold but it&#39;s potentially a trap because the biggest let know is tof the psychological defense emphasis that should occur in regards to Pink and Yellow that my Main Spirit Guides indicated with potentially similar emphasis on everyone else because by taking a realistic look at it looks to be multiple colours. Grey I have received a certain group to be the good guys and making sure there is psychological defense in regards to White Black and Grey is paramount. I advocated for Purple and Green to receive rel-alignment but my Main Spirit Guides information being understood and heard more than myself is important. I feel there are also thought certain bad guy potentially posing as grey as well trying to scare and confuse, a certain kind of baddie. <br>- Heightened actions and biblical stuff happening at times around myself, these story let knows and realism let knows pertaining to life and others are important. <br>- Certain negative psychologicals took a hit today and cards as well as others pulled in regards to understanding and realizing the severity of the situations, affecting whole past and futures in regards to my actions needs to be understood at times and I need to be placed where my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. My Main Spirit Guides Chain of Command is defined by my Main Spirit Guides in the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light.
