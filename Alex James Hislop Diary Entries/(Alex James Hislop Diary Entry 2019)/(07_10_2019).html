<div class="content">Activity:<br>- Certain kinds of overlap and talk of different kinds of interaction have been happening as of late. One of which happens to do with like the famous of Earth Past and certain kind of Earth past in which there is like some sort of battle that takes place and has supposedly been taking place. <br>- Upon going to bed I again felt some of those energies again that has been letting know of certain kinds of conflict taking place. <br>- I read the (AJHD) Solvenia Access Viability information with my out loud voice upon having thunderous thoughts feng shuied from certain aspects of the spirit to read it five times in which I only proceeded to read it once. This turned into certain reasonings used in a certain manner as to why certain attack was happening in regards to only reading once but the real reason might have had more to with the subject matter and not even that. It might have had to do with a certain kind of interaction bubble brought forth in the vicinity as well as events unfolding. I would use the heightening of the thought areas to my advantage although I didn&#39;t fully utilize to the degree some would have wanted, I still did read the document disclaimers in regards to the (AJHD) Solvenia Access Document. There was certain implosions happening though and it felt like certain peoples were targeting certain kind in regards to myself, I am not certain what kind of aspects but either way my name in regards to some of it was utilized and things of that nature. I would get to a point where I would defend myself later early morning the next day in decent manners and hitting home upon my defense in multiple regards. I would go towards the beach areas at the end of my street and provided my defense which made sense especially standing next to the reasonings for some of the attack on my end in which did reach past to vindicate some in which were also being blamed that were innocent. Some of the defense I speak of has to do with what&#39;s located on the (07/11/2019) Alex James Hislop Diary Entry. <br><br>I am Alex James Hislop. My Main Camp is my Main Spirit Guides.
