Dec 16, 2019, 3:56:44 AM</div>
<div class="title">(11/23/2019)</div>
<div class="content">After the events of yesterday and the energies and happenings of one of the content experiences I watched, in which yesterday seemed chalked full of links and connections understood by some behind the scenes in which some segwayed to other content experiences I had been experiencing notably a game I have been play as of late, there was moments where some of what has been depicted in the some of the movies and games I have been playing carried out in certain fashion. I would feel assault and turn ulence in my home upon watching a content experience and it&#39;s difficult to get angry when that emotion is being suppressed and also have had past dealings in which has not helped, not blaming anger but there is certain kind that do not want to be angry anymore and for some if anger provided is not the right kind, if it&#39;s utilized in a certain way and accompanied with behaviour changes that has not been desirable that some have to go another way. I created an AJH Radio Free Earth early morning in which felt good upon the discussion of taking away of defense in regards to defending oneself in which needs to be understood for what it is in a certain sense and the need still for spiritual defense in moments where in front of the scenes or what have you defends themselves. It segwayed to multiple other issues and disparities. It was partially on the subject itself in regards to erratic ,incoherent and acceleration happening within processes that talk about this subject matter and ones that don&#39;t, it speaks of something else and maybe there is warfare in the mix but I think it&#39;s more complicated than that. I have been attacked spiritually at times, yesterday, the day before and today in certain manners, some of it has been certain kind trying to help me, maybe the impression unhookup and utilization was decent and maybe the sheoingg up of certain. Kind wasn&#39;t always bad, maybe some of it is entertainment but there is something else at times, the energies speak of this and I do want to talk positivity and enlightenment, I am going to an NDE conference in which I don&#39;t want. I want to play it the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. My process being so disruptive as it has been at times, it&#39;s not just life utilization woes in which has been fixed up at times in big ways but it seems to be more certain kind working against at times as well. I feel there are certain kind today helping me in many different ways, I feel I have been lead well in which in the mix has been a certain kind disrupting and harming that direction. Some of it having to do with earth based, I can&#39;t feel it hasn&#39;t had nothing to do with it and maybe earth that aware of this process feels the same way in regards to me. <br>There has been this actor they brought up multiple times reminds of an actor in a heist movie, family and dark grey impressions, shaped in a certain manner. They kept ringing and flashing his form, there was a certain kind of having to do with Hollywood and certain events taking place potentially. There was a moment where a portion of my psychictivty changed, an insinuation that there was certain conflict with my Main Spirit Guides in the spirit but also other Spirit as well. Wasn&#39;t trying to do large beliefs for what acceptable but rather defend myself upon certain kind trying to invoke a belief I did not feel to be that Hollywood is bad. I felt it&#39;s rather good and I had many different experiences to pull from. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light in regards to my Spiritual Guideship especially outside the Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to my Family the way my Main Spirit Guides. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to the Families that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>As I went to Toronto I could feel the energies, tense and a silence in the air that seemed to be hanging. A sense picked up that would usually lead me to believe that a spiritual battle was taking place but I need to realize that pressure drops and silence don&#39;t always mean conflict although I feel a portion of it is and would be interested to see a stat regarding if the times that I did discern this kind of energy was actually battle or conflict. Either way I would note different kinds of stimuli spiritually as a psychic medium, driven by my father to the first meeting of the IANDS chapter in Toronto. The stimuli pointed towards movement other dimensional in regards to myself and others. I have been a person of multiple world&#39;s, the dark and twisted, misunderstood version of the world that seemed to cherish the bad things in life, hanging shadow partially not of choice for some but for others most certainly so and that in which was a way of life for both. The other world I speak of is good, caring and compassionate, enlightened to be true that speaks of what a large portion of the Psychic mediums let know of. Those of the Light, God and Angels in which does extend to realism culture. That in which reminds of western culture and earth based cultures with enlightenment and goodness exists, for some today I no doubt feel that there was a light bulb moment, &quot;Of course this exists&quot; in which must have been the blessing and the curse of some of the experiences that a portion have had and the experiences that others might not be able to experience. The sadness and choice for certain kind in which they shouldn&#39;t have to feel embarrassed or disparity regarding but should rather have been given the best of the situation earlier and how can we look towards that darker world and blame them, as moderately absurd and difficult as that might be, there are certain situations that God scratches his head at. In my observation the Original Creator has been at this for a long time and I am not saying God can&#39;t fix it because he can in a certain sense but there are also lines that exist between Peoples, Gods and Spirit in which can be upsetting to understand in which I feel the direction in regards to the Spiritualist Communities on this Planet Earth is correct but I feel the need to let know of some of the experiences that are pointing towards what is taking place within multiple dimensional existences. I have understood that good exists, heck I might not fully know why it works the way it does with miracles and positivity, decency in abundance and yet another kind that have been here potentially for a while and maybe a lot longer than any of us know exists. When I got to Toronto I could feel the conversations and debate in a certain sense, maybe it wasn&#39;t even a conversation but some yelling in the Spirit God not forbid. Just one of those things that happens but a real emphasis from certain kind holding it down, that they felt the library placed on a street called Memorial to be fitting and the Artwork outside the building standing like a monument to way more than just my arrival and the continued stuck in my head space with thoughts of me but rather something else that seemed to speak of metaphor and not literal metaphor either. There was a calmness about the spirit this day. Two days previous of psychictivty situatiing and prepared probably for some supposedly unforseen venture into the city, the note that days it&#39;s not all decent exists and something I have been working through. This constant tug of war over the gravity of the situation, one side utilizing to further whatever the heck else exists other than quality of life and safety while others pointing out the craziness of such ripple affect to actions while also looking at the cheat sheet to realize that it is a fairly big deal maybe only if you include the spirit, the others that it has to do with and maybe a certain kind would have given survival context or maybe quality of life. Yeah I went in there and felt shrunk down, a different be quiet Alex that worked without me protesting. It was good to focus on the spiritual in what others are going through and to meet some I had seen on NDE conference content and I am sure there are spirits laughing at the truth being that I haven&#39;t seen nearly as many spiritualist content as I truly need too. It was a group of people interested in the spiritual and it&#39;s the great thing about IANDS, there care free and comfortable approach to a situation that says calmer heads prevail. They have a way about them that speaks of calm authority, I can feel these energies that lets know that they are of the air and wind but also of other elements too. They bring fourth a certain kind of positivity not just in happiness and joy, two of some of the best but they also bring reassuring energies in regards to the afterlife while still letting know of some of the more distressing NDEs. They are one of the Spiritual Leaders on this planet and they prove it everyday. Yvonne Kaison spoke about her five NDEs, three later in life and two from early childhood remembered. She was one of the first Canadian Doctors to specialize in NDE research and I feel she furthered some of the terminology in regards to NDE research after Raymond Moody and others. She spoke and I could see flashes of shaping in regards to people that she reminded of, as of late it has been physically speaking, the expressions and shaping of the face specifically. There were psychic flashes of this, similar to capture points of a person&#39;s resting face, a spiritual snapshot of those in which remind of the shaping. I could note multiple experiences some of the spirit were having through her behind the scenes. I wondered if others were having similar experiences as to what i have been able to note in the spirit world. I don&#39;t know how to let know of some of the expressions and emphasis in negative seen though people. I don&#39;t want to offend and I don&#39;t want to get it wrong and of course there are those that say we shape our own reality but if I am shaping my own reality, then this is what I am discerning in regards to some of the negative taking place? And how is it being shaped to the negative with all of the positivity let knows at times, for in which is partially relied upon spiritual infromation. How can I speak on something that I would want to be true. I did an advocation earlier to be changed spiritually in the moments that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and I am hoping it registered, Spiritually speaking we can change for some of us our forms and atmospherics as well as other kinds to reflect all manner of different things. As a psychic I have been able to feel these changes at times, feel more feminine not just in form but also personality and behaviour changes along with. Fashion, Behaviour, Personality, Spotenaity, Workforce and other kinds similar to clothing for some but other kinds much more encapsulating, although clothing is a bigger thing than we fully realize down here. I feel there were moments this where that change reflected in certain moments which might have been needed. To the happening upon the city, I would note the ability to create happiness in ways in which had it be cross referenced with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated upon an ability to be able with will that into others which saw certain infrastructure spiritually noted to change, I could see it with my psychic eyes and sense the trees to be happier when it was done upon them. There is I feel a need for callwords to do spiritual actions towards but I see the merit in just doing certain actions. I met certain people there that were shaped a certain manner, does this shaping always lend fourth to the life that one has lived, in the physical live life, no. Spiritually my experience tells me that some have experienced certain things sometimes in regards to certain kinds life and that the shaping has been a tell of this experiences. For example, I see someone shaped like a family man  arechetype but also of a comedian in which the kind of shaping sometimes lends towards what I have been through pertaining to notable content experiences within my life. I think of a couple films as impactful favorites in which I felt at times through my experience with content that there has been moments of shaping of Content. <br><br>That there might be darker elements in regards to  <br><br>Ideas:<br>The facilitation from certain referees especially given stance in how certain proceedings have happened.
