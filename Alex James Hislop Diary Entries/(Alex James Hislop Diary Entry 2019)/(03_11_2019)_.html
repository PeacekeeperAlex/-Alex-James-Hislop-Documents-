<div class="content">Activity: <br>Beginning of the day I felt there was reputational defense and other kinds of ways to defend certain spirits brought up in a certain capacity, I think there was need for supplies and resources as well protection in regards to certain kinds of informational displays. There has been some turbulence a couple days previous and I really feel we need to understand certain situational awareness regarding the fact that we can&#39;t always be blaming high turbulence with saying certain things getting through to certain areas and potentially causing higher vibrational frequencies to be invoked and a movement of dimensions as the problem, being famous and in a position of power as well as a big and that sort of thing has taken the hit in this process quite a lot these past couple years if not previous as well at times. Near the end of the day there was this video I saw supposedly of an angel saving a store clerk by tapping him on the shoulder and him seeing a danger that presented itself by way of metal gate closing and then seemingly could not find the person who tapped him on the shoulder, like he disappeared. The demeanor and inflection of the walk reminded me of someone in which I did advocations in regards to but there was also other tells as well in regards to a couple different things. I felt my process change and a different kind of in front of the scenes conversations invoked, one of which had to do with the demonic counterparts that my Main Camp indicated in regards to if there is that sort of physical angelic appearances, specifically the kind in which is subtle yet powerful. One of the issues I have discerned with this kind of saving and not so in this day and age is the technological aspects of things, I don&#39;t doubt for a moment that there is compensating factors pertaining, talk about body manifestations in the physical as well as utilization fo certain kinds of lives in certain manners and what else is possible, what would be more out of place at times as well as the factor of saving multiple kinds of people not just in regards to a physical but rather what you can do with that physical form in the time frame given. I get the impression that some would rather me not be so heavy handed in regards to certain things and yet  I am curious and will continue to be curious by way of it&#39;s nature. There was Different dimensional information flowing through, people happy towards certain advocationals as well as not so, continued dimensional movements on my end, being brought into certain atmospherics and dimensional<br><br><br>Defense: <br>Flowing of cash and monetaries into myself and certain numbers existing that might also be existing in regards to together in a certain way, doing advocates in resituating that cash flow to help those that my Main Camp indicated and not utilizing an air of owning a certain process for what&#39;s acceptable.

Gender anomaly content experiences and gender emergences content experiences. Advocations in regards to reasonings as to why peoples of earth and others(defined by my Mian Camp indicated don&#39;t deserve to be harmed by way of my actions and how it is not that way. Existence creation now in regards to place and bodies, atmospherics that can take the hit in regards to having to vent and/or certain actions having to have happening regards to the actions, non-actions, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) of those that my Main camp indicated. Sticker day in different kinds of places where I can create and buy via contemplation while also putting custom stickers on walls. Updates and body exchanges and life situating in regards to bringing peoples into the fold, onse in regards to my end when people are brought into my end and ones in regards to when I am brought in. Getting harmed in regards to information, those supposed to receive the advocational prowess and thek ind life that I am currently receiving, the information and the ideas at times as well as other qualities Advocationals and potentially more. Augmentors in regards <br>Coffers and bins, like a god looking in a ibn once in a while or regularly to see if anything manisted, advocations towards that stuff<br>Materials excavation, materials placement and materials creation mining. motivators and feng shuiers of my actions, especially advocationals, testificationsals, board work, I and others(defined by my mian Cmap) don&#39;t want peoples to die in regards to our actions and non-actions the way my Main Camp indicated.
