<div class="title">(10/06/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I watched a content experience in which reminded me of certain again impressions. This particular impression reminded me of a certain kind of content vision. It&#39;s amazing the kinds of culture that exists within this world and I have discerned there to be certain kinds of impressions on certain content experiences in which send a message. This particular one I thought to be accenting emphasis in regards to maintaining content vision and it was even lamented upon via spiritual communication but their was also another interesting interaction. That in which reminds of hair standing on end and balled fists. There was tense impressions that I don&#39;t fully understand and again it kind of pulls me in the direction of the kind of interaction between culture and that in which facilitates a certain kind of in interaction and conflict especially when done through upon writing some of my experiences. There is no doubt conflict within culture specifically in regards to culture clashes but I am not certain that all off it is what it seems to be and especially upon some outside earth-base and even within try to facilitate such a conflict and also in the wind that goes do it in certain style and fashion in which is sanctioned lends to eclectic observation that is seen. <br>- There was a moment yesterday where I remember a spirit letting me know of something potentially happening with Kung Fu and Kung Fu Defense. It did kind of feel like there was a notice of conflict yesterday in which this past week and even and overall theme regarding this past month has been observed but it has also been talked about in regards to what events are being not noticed taking place especially in regards to certain processes not noting what they would have normally noted in the past with certain changes taking place. If this is a tell that some of use are not being attacked spiritually it should not be the difference in regards to bringing up conflict. There is such a thing as writing down history and reporting on events especially in a media capacity.<br>- I noticed upon creating a certain document in regards to the (AJHD) Physical Earth-Based Human Making a Better World Simulations and Other kinds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, where I noticed the conversation and spiritual communications veer towards this earth-based physical human controller type in which some have equated to Good vs Bad conversation in regards to Physical Earth Based. I feel it&#39;s a decent document to put into play in regards to disclaimers and advocations as well as testifications that can lend towards a framework utilized in the spirit to view what it would look like if world leaders and the powerful got together. <br>- Today there has been a lot of talking stemming for the last couple days on my end about leaving certain places. On one hand you have certain spirits that want other to continue to leave potentially by way of the ripple affect and impact in certain places and on the other you have certain kind that don&#39;t necessarily want some to leave and also tieing in with the conversation about leaving certain defense for those that stay behind certain dimensional threshold. <br>- Another stimuli experienced was process changes and a moral group of spirit maneuvering in this process coupled with a shoehorning of mechanisms in my head area in which happened first. The kind of stuff I am talking about was similar to though mechanisms and other kinds of other-dimensional anatomy.<br>- Near the end of the day I would feel apull on my spiritual cord in which felt like I was going inside the a womb or stomach area. I felt warmth and the channelwas affected and the urge to eat was affected as well. I could feel the channel like they were standing in front of me.<br>- I had watched Joker 2019 and I related certain kinds of impression linked to other movies in discerning spiritual filmamking. Really.amazing to catch tells of similar style of production and there is a a Spirit of the 80s and spirit of the 90s in this film almost a calloboration in a certain sense especially considering the dark times reminding me of the 90s but also a Spirit of GoldenYellow as well in which reminded of the 80s and an appreciation of Joker in which was found and an appreciation for Jack&#39;s Joker. I found to be quite illuminating in regards to the themes of Mobsters and how in this movie the depiction of joker would be the ecentric artist with mob fashion. I would note there to be something there and how I learned about joker to be true would be through later iterations especially the some people just want to watch the world burn Mentality of on screen portrayal. The fact that there was Antagonist to the Gangster and even common criminal makes that later Joker even more contrasting especially since a certain kind of spiritual criminal are fans of the Joker. There is a synergy between those two Jokers and I find it be almost a gleefull celebration of the character to see either both on the same side or against each other in spiritual content not to mention the spiritual aspects of those two in contrast and clash. Either way though I would see more energies and spirit of the making of that film potentially in proximity and potentially keeping tabs on mine and others viewing which brought another topic to the discussion areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. This having to do with content creation being affected upon viewing, again spiritual spotlight and fame being understood in a certain manner given a certain context in which when viewing content experience the literal production being affected and not so in regards to viewing, experiencing and interacting with said content. A Spirit emerging on behalf of a certain kind and other capacities in the time frames in regards to said content partially utilizing dimensional interaction upon viewings in the future. Can you imagine Spirits showing up on set to a physical film to be able to fill certain roles, partially by way of how certain kind of content creation can happen in the spirit specifically in regard to Earth based filmamking, and the idea that her would be a group of supers and villains on certain kind of comic book movies some said to be there upon certain comic creation of subject matter as well as future viewings of certain kind by certain kind of famous. Some of this on my end was discerned to have been partially by way of the kind of spirits I have around me at times, fans of entertainment and the kind of interaction that can create, resources in regards to content facilitation upon certain famous viewing entertainment and physical information creation in which is now existing online but some of it also had to do with keeping memory of myself existent in certain places, make him a movie star is classic line to keep that knowledge a!I&#39;ve but why then the shaping of my physical family members within certain famous. I saw aspects of pertaining to Louise Hislop, my aunt within the characteristics of Jack Napier in the beginning of Batman (1989) Joker. A question I don&#39;t fully understand when I see the characteristics of my physical family within certain actors and famous and even regular folk sometimes. There is the natural connection that some of us share on this planet and if it extends to genetics and when we are born as well as the spiritual influences regarding, then what does that speak of regarding events and the events that would unfold as well as the knowledge regarding especially upon the speaking of safeguarding memory of a certain kind in which could hold the key. <br><br>Document Creation:<br>(AJHD) Physical Earth-Based Human Making a Better World Simulations and Other kinds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated<br><br>Information Creation:<br>(Doesn&#39;t always include all of the information that I create throughout the Day)<br>Prime Time Sports pertaining to October 5th, 2019 (AJH Daily Defensives Board x1)<br> viewings in regards to the 2019 IANDS conference, IANDS 2019 conference (AJH Daily Defensive Board x1)<br>Events that my Main Spriit Guides indicated in regards to October 6th, 2019 (AJHD Daily Defensive Board x30)<br>Past Events that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and understanding what my Main Spirit Guides indicated (AJHD Daily Defensives Board x1)<br><br>They said there was something that took place during the recording of the psychic wargamers that there was a certain conflict that took place and that sporitually someone was attacked.
