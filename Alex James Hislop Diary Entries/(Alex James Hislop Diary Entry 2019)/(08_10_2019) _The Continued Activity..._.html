<div class="title">(08/10/2019) &quot;The Continued Activity...&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Early morning happenings taking place in regards to breath and motion in which I was having difficulty discerning in a certain sense in which the spirit are masking but also trying to have happen by saying that it is masked. The sort of thing where I have a thought about how someone looks and so said that thought created and lent towards how they looked. There was something this past couple days and week that was initiated in regards to the events of my life and others in how we affect certain things, like some were have said to have gone a certain direction where as if I was to meet and interact with some in a certain way and the affect that would happen taking place, some are still trying to go this direction and some still have not have gone this direction but i felt a tug of war in regards to it which changed this night upon some trying to flip a mechanism in regards to hide certain things that were going this direction. <br>As you can see there are certain physicals that were affected by myself without me fully interact with them in the physical. <br>There was said to have been a battle for earth which I am wondering these days is connected to the Battle of Los Angeles which was said to have taken place last week in a certain capacity, again it&#39;s not what some think, there are still people going about their business, it&#39;s not always this everybody stop what their doing spiritually except that there has been things. There are certain ways of doing events at times and it has to do with staggering in some capacities as well as different methods in regards to certain event like bringing certain historical battles in regards to earth past certain points in earth history. This again is a certain fashion and for others it&#39;s not necessarily so. Others have the battle in the moment that it arrives while some do it in different points in time without the staggering dragging the event through history. There is an emphasis through on a certain realism aspect in getting the battle done when it happens. I discerned pulling form something in regards to Game of Thrones by way of Characters and the kinds that some are trying to portray to potentially affect the film as well as affect my current process as well as others. I have seen this before in multiple ways. But the kinds of stuff happening at times has let me know that there is still a traversing happening and a streamlining taking place. <br>- Another thing that has been happening at times is upon some of my advovations in regards to informational placement pertaining to creation and evolution of species that there were certain kind that have been bringing up certain idea of doing advovations and overlap regarding pertaining to evolution and creation of species. For example I did an advocation in regards to the lion, one of the offer verbal physical by myself and others in which potentially was heard in regards to overlap in which did impact in a certain manner creation and evolution of that species, and there have been others to a certain extent that I have discerned to be prompted at times like the pig within the past couple days. The idea that I and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated are affecting species evolution is fascinating and scary to a certain extent and I do feel there is a line in regards to freewill advocations to be said but I can&#39;t help but feel that it&#39;s a bit soon to be doing that on my end but the scary part is that some have let know here and there that certain overlap pertaining could be happening currently in a certain way in which has lent towards the idea that some in my process have potentially lent impact and ripple affect in regards to ourselves and others that my main Spirit Guides indicated in trying to help situate as others kind in regards to such endeavours of affecting evolution and creation. Again it lends towards that discussion and things talked about in regards to set in stone and utilization of my impact, process and name in which has lent towards Credit and Blame in certain mental where I didn&#39;t interact with certain kind although operated in certain manner like I did, that sort of thing where certain things already happened, certain people already shaped and you can see it in the physical except now it&#39;s impressing upon other dimensional existences in similar fashion and dissimilar fashion.<br>- The idea that the soul leaves the body prior to death for certain aspects of all personal and other dimensional selves I feel is truth but for some it&#39;s not, like the physical driver at times experiencing death although I do feel there is moments of mercy like Emily Rose an angelic appearing and taking her to Heaven. I started looking at this place in a certain way that what a priveladge to live in a place like this where for most people seemingly at times in which might change in the future as the veil continues to thin and higher vibrations achieved, that what an honour to be in this place. The idea the some groups are influencing this space and aspect of this space in certain manners. That some view this place in a certain way that can be utilized to shape perspective in multiple kinds of ways. The idea that there is all kinds of different existences that can facilitate ways of life in many different manners and upon bringing up gaming existences and other kinds especially in regards to immorality, some have looked from a certain lense of potential and hurt in which need not exist in certain manners which creates a desire to go to those places. Let me get this straight though because I do love this place. I do care about this place and I want the creators to know what they already behold in what my Main Authorities indicated. <br>- There has been difficulties as of late and discussions in regards to rights in which I don&#39;t know has anything with do some of the creators of this place. The sort do thing where people being left behind when there is movement of heaven downwards at times. Maybe there are those moving forwards as well and also those we are leaving as moving higher in vibrations. What is the correlation between moving higher up and heaven moving downwards.<br>- <br><br>Advocationals:<br>Those the do sacrifice and those that do play the systems that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>Those that lend resources to each other and others in regards to saving some from peril and passing especially in regards to this physical earth-based.<br>Those that deal with set in stone and destiny as well as the variations and affecting things. <br>Ripple affect and informational placement. <br>Reputational Defense in regards to Evil and facilitation of the ways of Life that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>Those that have been going a certain fashion that was said to be me in other dimensional self reference in which wanted me to be more lax this month.<br>Tank, Scout, Medic, Kung-Fu defensive style deflective, Psychic.<br>Life information that my Main Spirit Guides.<br>Naturalist, FacilitationOfGreenerPastures.<br>Runs for supplies and those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>Clarifications in regards to those that helped and tried too help that did not benefit, especially those moving in a certain direction sometimes thought to be bad.<br><br><br><br>Ideas:<br>Signing, permissions and consent<br>Let knows in regards to that the authorities that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and Earth that my Main Spirit Guides indicated can reach those on Earth in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>Leaving things here and there along the tracks and those that provide in regards to that.<br>Clarifications in regards to Authorities that my Main Spirit Guides indicated pertaining to what they sectioned and what they did not.<br>If the Old ones were to look at it from the perspective from themselves being attacked equating to the amount that there other dimensional selves are attacked. What does it look like when you couple together all the life that is being lived from the old ones in a certain fashion and group it together in lifepools, what does it look like for truth? How many old ones are actually truly being attacked?
