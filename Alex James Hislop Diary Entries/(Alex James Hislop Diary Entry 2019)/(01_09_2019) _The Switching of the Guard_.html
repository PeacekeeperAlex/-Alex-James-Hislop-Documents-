<div class="title">(01/09/2019) &quot;The Switching of the Guard&quot;</div>
<div class="content">- Activity: A lot of different kind of benevolent spirits around supposedly, kind of feels like certain bad guys have somewhat disappeared but two moves i did this morning i felt were decent. One of which had to do with me putting a certain kind of switching in regards to something i have learned as a psychic potentially exists. That being multiple kind of recording within visuals and audio that can be played upon replaying certain content. There seemed to be something strange going on with those beings who are usually change certain kind of content. ANother sort of let know is neighbors and things changing within certain areas. Potentially certain lines of existence changes. There was also talk of different kinds of worlds and areas being attacked from a far and that there was certain beings and spirits who had to hold it down on our end. In that how we respond potentially does matter. Different kinds of ways to type english was let know in regards to certain things, I think of string along words without spaces or combining letters together. Hope.<br><br>-Let knows: <br><br>- IDEAS: Let knows and advocational support in regards to why it is not so easy in regards to voting in regards to some of the stuff pertaining to ending and resets and to get certain kind of resources and change to happen in a certain kinds of specifically in regards to looking. The Idea to create a recreation within my story and the things that have happened to me, multiple angels of the story and stories. I thought of something I thought the things I sometimes see in movies are potentially different than in certain real life, that there was this likeability that is sometimes lost when looking at certain real events. what&#39;s amazing about this is that there is a realism sometimes within movies as well. Imagine watching a certain film where the bad guy is likeable by way of many different factors, what if from another perspective he is more hated. The idea to recreate certain events in a personal way in certain movie form to lend care, compassion from myself. The utilization of this sort of tool in being able to satiate the desire for certain historians to put some spin in the mix. That sort of Idea that exists to try and help those who are dealing with being a part of brimstone culture and the backlash that the potentially go through helping them. Went to the veterinarian in Georgina and it was earily to see certain things like there theme of where sunshine passed on. There was also a let know in regards to certain things  Worked on a<br><br>- Defence: There there are those potentially utilizing certain thing within my process. Like making me do things in other dimensions that I am not doing, attacking me in places where spirits and beings get to me to help me, doing some of these tactics to others. There even other stuff too where its not like terribly but to be able to say that in regards to certain opinions and mentality presented, just enough to potentially tip scales in a certain ways later on, one of the dirty tactics is putting access to my process in the mix with other processes that might be considered similar and not so, by way of Heightening  and others things of that nature, of course there are those utilizing this in a decent manner to try and help but some potentially are not. The hiding obscuring of information and stances in which I am actually going, why the need for life stealing when we just create new bodies and mechanisms and things of that nature. Makes no sense why that is still needed when there is a multiple kinds of alternatives that don&#39;t necessarily have to be dirt y and dirty can live on through. The sort of way of targeting certain things i haven&#39;t worked on in certain regards but there is a multiple fold here, there is a need and certain spirits do try to utilize me to go that way at times and it&#39;s done the way my main spirit guides indicated. Sometimes asking me to be a bigger authority and not necessarily having any other choice or even being put in situations where i don&#39;t necessarily want to choose otherwise to then be used against myself is one of those that at times has been used against myself. There is this thing at times that happens, a sort of thing in where in the way we speak could be considered unclotuh or harmful if there is certain systems a happening but this is also one of the reasons potentially as to why certain communication contact should be made in an honest and truthful manner. There actually is multiple advanced forms of english, latin and other languages to a certain degree in which even having access towards would help to a certain degree but I ultimately don&#39;t feel it should be a problem either way cause it shouldn&#39;t limit whether we have access to the kind of communities that my main camp indicated. There is a limit of expression threshold in regards to beings certain beings and it&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing, some people look at it like vacation. There are those where understanding that reaction does sometimes matter, that sort of things where you react a certain way as to give tells, that sort of thing &quot;if it doesn&#39;t matter then why react that way&quot; sort of stuff. Sort of thing where i can get certain promoter of immorality to do certain things in regards to the way I want to approach story and things of that nature, hey even if it&#39;s seemingly immorality it still a cool gig within the confines of certain things. <br><br>- Advocations: Concepts, Non-Concepts, Process Systems, Ways of Life, Culture, Advocations, Testificatinos, Clarifications, Disclaimers, Industry, Energies and Colour, Neighbors, Proximities, Vicinities, Other world conflict and how we respond during tohse other world conflicts, Past process specifics in regards to people experiencing my life after as well as potentially before, Reproductions of advocations identifiers and authenticity advocations, Those helping my life in the ways that my main camp indicated especially those research and going through my life in regards to truthBurying/Digging sort of stuff, Etc.(defined by my Main Camp), Honesty, Essential Board stuff and Focusing on my Advocations clarifying my actions, etc.(defined by my Main Camp).
