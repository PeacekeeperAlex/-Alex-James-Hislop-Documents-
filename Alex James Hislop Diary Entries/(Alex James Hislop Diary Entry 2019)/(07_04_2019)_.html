<div class="title">(07/04/2019) </div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Upon waking up super realistic and urgent tones in the air, a wake up call that this isn&#39;t just some game. My dreams reflected a thriller style energy kind of reflection in which felt realistic and sent the dream realm a let know as to the current situations , I feel that might be a tell. People were said to have been harmed on my end in a certain manner. People keep knocking at the door of seriousness but we will see how long it lasts. <br>Upon going to bed there was an implosion in which felt like some were switching up from the current mode and tone in regards to that of the spiritualist process but I am continuing that road so it will be interesting to see how that evolves especially with the current setup in regards to certain interaction in regards to reasonings to attack myself which is slim pickins these days. The idea is that someone was screwing up yesterday by going certain directions which felt like someone choosing <br>- There was an epiphany yesterday in multiple regards though upon going to bed, there were those maneuvering and doing things that I have been trying to get some to do for a while now thought in which segwayed to a realization that I do like Long game healing and that a lot of what I have been feeling in regards to instant invulnerable defense and the other kinds has had to do with getting attacked and quality of life in regards to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I think maybe there was a revelation in that I haven&#39;t been trying to harm and sabotage long game healing as much as was insinuated. Regardless there an intense moment of revelation in regards to certain moments in which changed the direction of certain kind pertaining to long game mending and that coupled with a certain style of Long Game Mend, spread out over certain society and increased time in regards to healing made it quite interesting to reflect especially in regards to the two moments that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There other moments as well upon me laughing in the computer room in regards to certain spirits defending and other venturing forth to the areas that my Main Camp indicated but sadly it didn&#39;t last long as certain events unfolded and to be quite honest I am wondering now if there has been event unfoldings and stoppages in the allotted time in regards to that sort of thing anyhow.<br>- It also seemed like some needed that to be the case anyhow as more revelation in regards to certain kind of a certain banner whether it be not in officially capacity, pretending or otherwise has attacked me at times as well specifically while in similar viewpoint regards certain things. <br>- Multiple kinds of experiences from talking in regards to certain forums looking down on the deck to the stairs in regards to some of the current situations ato a spiritual interaction pertaining to spiritualism as well as aspects of earth potentially getting attacked. I also copied and pasted multiple things on my Alex James Hislop Diary Entries some which explaining clickable links as well as history advocations in regards to the Diary Entries themselves and advocations in regards to the Advocational Section.<br>- Still a group trying to get me to do certain documents although I don&#39;t thing in a too indecent way, I still feel they are out there but in the mix are those trying to survive. Multiple swirls of energies and advanced interaction as well as some traversing upwards to try and work against me from a higher point of view so said but there was still the destruction from yesterday.<br>- Multiple fame indications as well as interaction to facilitate certain things happening from vindication in regards to things copied and pasted in regards to the Diary Entries to certain aspects of my process unraveling some went the way of decent even if a little too strong which partially lent towards acceleration and heightening.<br>- There was also strong moments of God within my process in which I have discerned there to be from yesterday interaction upon noticing the course of certain route taken by spirits, there was an interaction in regards to certain Gods specifically in front of my television some in which pertaining to a show I was watching, I discerned some bringing up certain kinds of things in which might have been partial entertainment as well as partial realism. <br><br><br>Advocationals:<br>- A big pact between animals and others on this planet pertaining to food chain and ways of life. A large percentage of beings in regards to their own species on this planet in which protects them karmically in regards to eating habits and passing on. <br>- Advocations in regards to life information in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to this marking, advocation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>- Let knows that those that my Main are scared<br>- - Shaking off the Authority stuff that my Main Spirit Guides Indicated in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>- Situating those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to the Authority the Mechanisms that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>Gaming, Health, Preparation<br>- Canada in regards to the areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated wants to be placed where my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>- America<br>- Love<br>- Defense, Protection, Healing, Testifications, Advocations, CLarifications, Disclaimers, Help<br>- Long Game Mend,  Proximites and Vicinities, those that that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that have not benefited from my direction, <br>- Ripple Affect, Argumentatives, Leaders, Memory, Recruitment, Auxiliary, <br>- Runners, Messengers, Scouts, Courriers, Post, Comunique Mechanisms, Communicational Attachment<br>- What could exist and how what has existed, what exists in regards to instantaneous defense, etc.(defined by my Main Camp)<br>- Situating skeletons in the closet especially in regards to the ongoing that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to myself and others(defined by my mian Camp)<br>- - life in regards to fun, entertainment, and what we want do that my Main Spirit GUides.
