<div class="title">(05/20/2020) &quot;Post Office Days Part 2&quot;</div>
<div class="content"><br><br>Activity:<br>I felt female hands on my chest area and it was smoother and skinnier than me and yet still a part of me, like someone touching me in another dimensional area and my form being different while still a part albeit probably consider by some to be separate and different while the way I felt it made me feel better about myself at the same time as something different. It was like she put bandages on my chest area. When she touched me it felt like she was leaving but I don&#39;t think that is truly the case. There was a sadness. It amidst certain spiritual leaving and it invoked such moving within me in how I feel about myself. It wasn&#39;t just about ascetics but also a barrier that seems to be keep people and spiritual who I care about away. It made me think that people and spiritual out there that look a certain way especially those wishing and wanting upon desire to look different the way they want to look exactly as they want in dimensional existences especially in regards to their live dimensional bodies and other kinds. Because I could feel a touch that while some could say that there is possibility of psychic stimuli discernment being facilitated in regards to being able to feel other touches and other bodies there is still a strong possibility upon the experience to which I was experiencing and have experienced as I know this dimensional to exist that it was a stimuli in regards to me. It made me understand that I do look good because I could feel the form of myself upon the touch in which was made which was in much better shape than I thought I was in which upon the realization that in other-dimensional I actually look that way, the way that I felt and it being in regards to me made me feel like such a revelation should be shared with the world to know that there other dimensional in which view and interact with you as if you felt the way you wanted to feel in regards to form and shaping. There was a comfortable in regards to my body feeling that in in knowing how I could look the way I felt earlier with that one touch. I could feel that that place holds a certain kind of power and that there could be other dimensional similar, there have been the quick discernment of touch upon some of those places at times.  The sadness that was present was not just me but also other spiritual in proximity. There traumatic stuff that happened before hand and I could sense things in the house again. I could sense a certain silence and a waiting as well as when I defended myself outside in which was supposedly decent certain proximity continue to talk about the issues. This day was a personal day and it seemed to be many saved that colours my horizon but a blind man must always see and in what direction would I find myself in not still paying attention. People through my life mentioned at times in what seems to be certain kind not leaving alone and so at the same time. Does the good deserve to be reprimanded for such what happens? No, not really depending on what was done and not done but at what point do you just sit there and stair at a wall for the rest of your life waiting for what should have been already done and as you can that in which is being done as the there was triumph of good yesterday and throughout happened to be true but it wasn&#39;t fully without loss because there was conflict in which took place and that in which even some say isn&#39;t conflict for that does exist. At what point does the loss not be questioned or understood as has been seen by those in my process to be paying attention especially when even those higher up differences agree on the line too far and the many to exist regarding if separate. There shaping events this day where I would look towards physicals on the street looking like certain family and shaping events said to take place in which there is a shaping variable throughout life influenced by the spirit. When I would note the shapings it felt like there was a spiritual in regards to myself that had been put through the ringer, a sadness present and dimensional setup speaking unorthodox as well as the let knows of walls of interaction changing upon economics and understood variables emerging. When did working on ones life become a job and when did we start having to do with things that we didn&#39;t want to do emerge, when was that it became what some would look at survival in attaining and maintaining a quality of life especially upon a variable so extreme as keep one self safe. Can you imagine some in the spiritual where there is this variable where you literally need to defend yourself in certain spiritual areas if you were ever to go to such places. It&#39;s a scary connotation considering that most areas are safe, literal percentage that exists in most place pointing towards the fact that the is good within the world that never get attacked especially behind the scenes while incarnate.<br><br>Quirk: I am Sparkly, Free and Funloving.<br>List:<br>1 - Quirks and Characteristics, personality, mentality and behavior.<br>2 - Concept Comments.<br>3 - Psychictivity.<br>4 - Rights Activism.<br>5 - Literature and Intellectuals.<br>6 - Reason and Love.<br>7 - Personal.<br>8 - Pursuit of Happiness.<br>9 - Experiencing what we want to experience cross referenced with what our Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br><br>Ideas:<br>Live in regards to earth-based<br>Situating afterlife in regards to Earth-Based<br>Life preparation beforelife <br>Time energies, quck more intense time energies still in laid back key.<br>The ones before the 19th was more lax, said to be more off to the side. Both still on me. Feng shui of energies regarding both, again both are still on me.<br>that if the good can trace the steps of the bad and can save good.<br>the kind of stuff spiritual give and the other kinds, like a toy that you put on a special cupboard saving a bunch of spiritual behind the scenes. Those kinds of variables where the true good just situate all of it or most of it. That might be normality for some. <br><br>Themes:<br>#Psychictivity #Sports#Wrestling #Entertainment<br>#Torment #Vacation #Transportation #PostOfficeDays #HighStreet<br>#Love #Channeling #Good #Moral #Lovers #TwinFlame #Personal<br>#Saved #<br></div>
