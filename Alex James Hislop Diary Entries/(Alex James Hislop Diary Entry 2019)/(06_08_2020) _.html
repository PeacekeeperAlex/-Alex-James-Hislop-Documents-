<div class="title">(06/08/2020) &quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>Woke up in the middle of the night and Authorities around. There was this suppression of sadness at times. <br><br>I keep feeling like i am pushed to the back of my head, like a certain other self being shoehorned into the back of my head area pressing upon the back of my head area in multiple way where the normal regular might note pressure but also headaches or starting of headaches. It&#39;s like I feel compartments as a psychic medium in which correspond with anatomical tells that the regular person is able to feel and there is crafting upon my observation potentially in regards to Physical Human Anatomy. I felt again more dimensional stimuli regarding movement. <br><br>I had a thought after some Authority and Non-Authority exchanges through my process and a certain kind of look upon what some of the spiritual and other-dimensional are experiencing through physical. Other-dimensional and spiritual through physicals that don&#39;t fully understand some of the psychictivity and other kinds for that in which is causing them distress. <br><br>Some on this planet potentially feel that there is less other-dimensional and spiritual than what some have espoused and some feel that there isn&#39;t other-dimensional infrastructure and spiritual infrastructure. For some of them it&#39;s a way of proceeding and playing certain situations but also a life parameters thing but also it can be more than that. It&#39;s also a certain kind of stance and a safety at times in which doesn&#39;t denote that there are those that strictly feel that there is not other-dimensional infrastructure and spiritual infrastructure. We all have our opinions and beliefs. <br><br>I know for myself that as a Psychic medium I have noted stimuli that speaks to me that such exist and there is possibility that both can be true and the spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding can prove it to be. <br><br>There has been noting at times certain spiritual through physicals that have been harassed at times and have been noting psychictivity through physicals that physicals aren&#39;t fully noting but also other kinds in which some of it claimed to be because of the physical. Either way I feel it to be an issue that deserves attention especially in regards to what&#39;s being said as to how the physical is responding to such let knows regarding spiritually behind the scenes. For many physicals, at least on this physical planet earth, are not wanting spiritual and other-dimensional through them to be suffering and that isn&#39;t to say some don&#39;t believe in defense especially self-defense. What a physical is experiencing through this phenomenon matters greatly as well. <br><br>There was disconnect today and I felt out of the loop but understood still in the loop by way of other machinisms. Other spiritual in which I couldn&#39;t discern which doesn&#39;t mean there not in my process. There was also feeling of missing something in regards to response. <br><br>God messages in regards to certain interaction, Ill bring up a topic earlier and then manifested later on in the day in different form. This has happened multiple times today in which feels like someone trying to get this some of this processes attention.<br><br>I felt like there was a moment within the past couple days where I felt like I was literally fist fighting with spirit but it felt more physical, like a spiritual will channel through and the spiritual feels like it&#39;s out of breath from fighting behind the scenes and it feels like it&#39;s more than spiritual it feels like other dimensional selves for some of it even though it might not be but I think some of it might be. Vent possibilities upon this and some with the hope of being given access to such ventworks.<br><br>Researched certain kind of Russian Nature and architecture as well as some of the history in which there was a perception update and was done so with some of the motivation having to do with changing a certain perception of Russia, I was upset that I had a negative perception in regards to quality of life but it was something i discerned beforehand, something that was changing and the spiritual even spoke on it changing and I discern it to be true. Canada does have that international kind of feeling, it&#39;s next to America so there is something about it but there has been this look at international at times and even being a similar kind of look to Continents and the kind that some espouse to be. <br><br>I brought up the good and asked for reasonings as to why these vibrational and spiritual as well as other-dimensional changes taking place and it hit home in a manner. <br><br>Another thing about beforehand had to do with this look and done so in a certain kind of royal at times but not always let known in that sort of manner. They said it had to do with certain kind of locking the doors and walking around. A certain kind of system where certain kind of Jailors and Wardens, but also other kinds in which I am not able to identify on my end physical.<br><br>Channel acting a bit funny these days after a day before of let know of needing resources and story moments of channel trust.<br><br>Huge moment of realization that things that were supposed to be deployed in regards to certain physicals, other-dimensional and spiritual regardless of whether I created physical information or not being said to be because of some of the informational I created. You can see the benefit at times regarding if a physical on this physical planet earth was to create the information that I did and how some would point towards it as being the reasonings but it some of them didn&#39;t say it was the only reason and it wasn&#39;t the only reason.<br><br>Certain kind of mending taking place, some trying to say what&#39;s Earth-Based physical and what isn&#39;t, but also another storyline of other kinds of spiritual helping the bad from earth-based. One of the things on my end though has been a look in regards to certain kind of spiritual around me today, Dimensional overlap shaped in regards to earth tagging along in regards to my interaction today was what was discerned for a portion. I have felt this spiritual come around me before, and it might have been there day. Another one had to do with capturing spiritual information in which I am not trying to capture when I physically write but there is consent regarding a portion of the information. There are those that have been stymied at times by my physical writings having to do with informational placement. <br><br>There was let knows at the end of the day, that in certain areas turbulence ensued. I am hoping for what my Main Spirit Guides relayed regarding the portions that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br><br>The last 2 months have been amazing to see the dimensional changes around me. It has been more than what I have been able to describe in this book. Continued movements upwards. Clean interactions. Nature impressions. Certain kind of platforming in regards to dimensional positioning. Flight and technology discerned in regards to some of the movement, flight feelings and impressional of moving through the air in a jet. Atmospheric energies. Weather energies. <br><br>Huge revelation and understanding that I have less to do with some of things happening at times even though there is a spirit for safety trying to let know that I did play a part in regards to some of the events spiritually that took place. but I do discern good utilization in regards to some of the impact machinisms and other kinds, <br><br>There is also other events though that need to be not forgotten about. It can matter.<br><br>There was a tell earlier that there might have been a let know strong regarding that there are other physicals on this physical planet earth that are decent in regards to Anti-Camp, even in fashions that I have espoused at times. There was a tell though that certain good, got more good. What Mend may we have need regarding both those kinds on Earth-Based. I would say to those going more good path and maybe leaving behind certain kinds of Anti-Camp compromise to here from what my Main Spriit Guides indicated, it would be what I choose compared to hearing from me the physical but there are some who can see me physically regarding. <br><br>Moments of old school physicians, certain spiritual alleviation upon certain kind combining back with me for some of them. I have felt other-dimensional infrastructure leave behind the scenes overlapping me but today it seemed that aspects that had left before had recombined. <br><br>Moments happening and some confusing at times that there is an emphasis in regards Earth-Based in regards to my process but that there is facilitation in regards to other kinds of spiritually, most notably on my end physically, Space and Other-Dimensional as well as Spiritual but I did feel better when certain other-dimensional got moved away from me but there is still care and compassion as well as hope for different kinds that had been facilitated in the past and the understanding that some of them are still within my process remains and there was also a tell that some of them are a part of Earth&#39;s process. <br></div>
