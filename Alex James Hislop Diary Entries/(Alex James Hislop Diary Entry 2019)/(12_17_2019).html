<div class="title">(12/17/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>What exactly is taking place with what certain spiritualists have labelled the event? The perception and lions share of the experiences pertaining to the Event have been positive and enlightened. It speaks of psychic awakening in which certain spiritualist and psychics have been experiencing for a while now although I do remember on my end something about early 2018 on my end being a certain kind of variable to the event. Psychctivity changing and heightened and clean energies experienced. There is a shift spoken about that is taking place in which is seeing the veil thinning in multiple kinds of ways and information making it through on this planet. This understanding and experience on the physical side of things on this planet has been steeped in spiritualist culture. What I write about this subject shouldn&#39;t adversely affect such a perception and decent in the view of how it is unfolding on this planet. I do mean to relay some of my notings of such happenings, early 2018 it was more enlightened at times through some of the experiences I would note and create a content video talking about such experiences. But the kinds of let knows regarding is that there is a moving and shaking of such an event behind the scenes in a societal, National and International sort of way. I have wondered what has caused such speed and movement pertaining to such psychictivty feng shui. One of the things I have seen is that psychictivity can be altered by spiritual entities and that most of the psychictivity if not all on this planet is influenced by some of the spiritual around oneself and potentially for some from certain spiritual afar. You will note if you pay close enough attention some of the storylines that exist in the spiritual, a decent sized portion if not more in regards to Earth-Based spiritual event located and recorded within some of the physical content on this planet. Books, Movies, Series,  Music, Games, Comics, Poetry and Art as well as others but there is something about Film and Books in which speak of story. I have seen some of these storylines facilitated on my end of the screen, meaning that the spiritual around me letting know of some of the storylines as well as fiction that exists revolving whether in personal interpretation or even bigger stages around the content that we as physicals on this physical planet earth create. Its&#39; not just in regards to the physicals but also in regards to other dimensionals. I have noted some of things taking place and I am thankful that most physicals have been experiencing the positive of such events. It&#39;s what we have been discerning and the reasonings for that whether they are natural or not exist. I have noted some of the debates in regards to such proceedings. There is an immorality culture that exists which I feel should be given the resources and outlets to be able to deal with some of the directions that this planet is heading the way those Main Spirit Guides that my Main Spriit Guides requested relayed. I feel there is a culture being put to the side in the way we used to do things changing. It speaks of evolution in a short time frame to tell truth. But some got it wrong and still do. There wasn&#39;t nearly as much war as there was peace throughout this planets history. It at times is forgotten in ways in which damage both. A spirit that knows and lies and a spirit that think they are telling truth. It&#39;s one of the key points in some of the spiritual attachments and events that have taken place so said to be and utilize in regards to the physical and other dimensional. Some look towards a portion and say that might be why this is being streamlined because of what had happened in the past. They aren&#39;t fully wrong for a portion. Another though says that we are ready to experience enlightenment and be told about the spiritual behind the scenes in certain manners. No amount of violent video games in front of the scenes or crass culture should be enough to say that we can&#39;t proceed in understanding the spiritual especially that in which tells of truth as to who we really are. Maybe the crass and violent content speaks of something else that when you mix that with with the enlightened culture being let known of that for a portion that that is who we really are for a portion. The question as to whether we still watch violent depiction within films in heaven and whether we have higher selves in which exist that don&#39;t should be understood. Maybe the bigger question is if we have lower selves that like to watch real life violence in an entertainment sort of way and whether the ways of facilitation of higher light that exist should be located lower downs for those staying behind. Timeline itineraries? Someone ask that question in the way better ways than I could. The direction of some have dictated the direction of others. This has been true to the too many cooks in the kitchen mentality, there are benefits and detriments in regards. Thank god there was for some in certain moments. When you get back to the reasoning though as to why we are experiencing certain kinds of turbulence and attack spiritually in certain moments, you might be walking down the street and in spiritual warfare at times and as incredible and scary as that is it&#39;s the truth. It&#39;s never happened not a once in regards to physical humans on earth-based? That is a lie. When we asked what we experienced spiritually? The answers as to why some culture were around us spiritually is that someone was trying to help. Is that a certain direction was trying to mend and facilitate ways of life. And that how we at times have looked at it through our physical perspectives, other-dimensional perspectives especially our higher light perspectives and sometimes even our darker perspectives for some, that we still felt a certain way in which was sometimes in conflict with a certain direction. They always said I was done but I felt someone else should have been done. It was the kinds of experiences that some were experiencing in which I saw that made us that my Main Spirit Guides indicated shake our heads and sometimes our fists. What exactly is being done spiritually to us in regards to this event. We have an enlightened version and accounts in front of the scenes but what exactly is happening to the darker kind. Just because a certain spirit is bad doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t have care, doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t care and if there was one thing that those good and bad spirit let know of is that there is such a thing as ones own. Because there was always a scarier spirit next door. It spoke of the layers upon layers of darker kinds that could exist if only in a dream. And it was that dream that was nowhere nears the kosher that some said it was in the eyes of a regular human, of me. How is that it looked like I was chirping out the true good for the lack of attention and presence when they were around and how is it that the dark gets to chirp them out far better than I could. It&#39;s because the terrors in the night do exist and what they can do to themselves is far worse than what they could ever do to me. Believe in true good, believe that the Good do care and hear from those who experiencing enlightened energies because that is where it is at, that is speaking truth and the variable that we can experience violent video games in heaven while being protected even in ways in which higher light might frown upon exists. <br><br>Some of this though is located within the film and content itself. In which can be altered and Changed given consent and authority as well as ability and others kinds in regards to a decent sized portion if not more. Imaigne a physical song on this planet to be like the speaker in which certain spiritual and other dimensional overlaps in regards to the content itself can be changed like tracks to a song. Like changing other dimensional recordings to a single film in which can be changed upon playing it again, there are ones hardwired into the content itself. The thing I love about books is the kind of style they work with which can seem bigger than this world even more so than the rest save music which is personal taste. Some still say books are the bigger content and have a similar synergy with Art. Literature is one of the greatest things that ever happened. It speaks to old souls and a certain kind in which you can feel sometimes when you are reading. Multiple kinds of dimensional overlaps and Anatomical like imagination and contemplation depending on the person work in unison sometimes when reading a book.
