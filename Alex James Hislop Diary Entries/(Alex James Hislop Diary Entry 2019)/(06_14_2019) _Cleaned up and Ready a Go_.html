<div class="title">(06/14/2019) &quot;Cleaned up and Ready a Go&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: *<br>I woke up and felt that certain aspects of myself had been attacked throughout the night although potentially labelled to be something that wasn&#39;t too bad, I am not certain if some were attacked and harmed. Spiritual abuse where I feel super lucid upon waking up and the energies around myself thinned in a certain manner. After the events that had happened yesterday with basketball. I did advocationals throughout the day to help the situations in which were unfolding as well as the updates that were happening in a certain manner. <br>- It then segwayed to me putting into play certain document where I was creating Dimensional Placement and Dimensional Setup information in regards to Alan Hislop, Anna Hislop, Victoria &quot;Belle&quot; Hislop and Bogart, eight documents in total where upon half way through certain interaction with the spirit changed in certain manner. There were groups in a certain kind of panicking mode trying to make it to be personal, through up a bunch of stuff is what was said, some of which bad in regards to myself and others. Something then happened in which changed the interaction, something was said to have been thrown up or happen in regards to myself or others where it kind of seemed like some were done with working against myself and that others didn&#39;t have a reason. <br>- The situation seemed to partially be stemming from earlier events in which something was fired, the crazy events on the 6th of June, 2019 as well as June 11th, 2019 but also other kinds, some of which having to do with Logic placement in the thought realm in which was discerned to be not a part of the plan. <br>- After certain spirits and others harrassed in regards to the dimensional placement document and dimensional setup documents and the events that unfolded in the timeframes that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, This turned into something else where it felt like some that were working against me before as well as parts of my Family swarmed to my house area and some people were to have <br>- This segwayed and was brought up to be linked with past events in 2018 and potentially earlier, that moment where I was in town and screaming saying this is going to be done if that&#39;s that case in which I then ran home by way of some of the interaction. Another one had to do with channeling spirit when I was in my Bathroom, saying that he needed help, almost like an other-dimensional self of mine was saying to wake up and do something to get someone&#39;s attention. There was also the kitchen memory in which was being explained that there are potentially parts of our lives in which there is turbulence and warfare battle and strife in which we are tying to defend ourselves, the memory tab looks like I am looking at the kitchen oven while walking past. The screaming match in November 2018 on Metro Road was another one as well as some of those memories in regards to those said to be working against me in certain capacities. There potentially being linked with the events that happened on June 14th, 2019 and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) either by way of Past-Present-Future interaction frameworks or other kinds as well. That sort of things where something happens in the present and that impacts what happened in the past where certain spirit can impact past and future events by way of present utilization. This felt like one of those conflicts where I and some of my process were being attacked in certain manners. This one has to be one of the worst ones that I have gauged thus far on my end because of kind of events insinuated at times. Almost the utilization of personal from a business perspective in which there are other ones in which it look like business doing that sort of thing at times, although I wonder hazard a guess if one of them is recreational using one of those conflicts, like what happened on the 8th of June, 2019 except that did look like a different conflict than what occured yesterday, still somehow a part of events in certain manners.  <br>- Early Firing? Someone utilizing a certain Event framework early to potentially impact the future. Multiple thought on this early firing, some were said to have been scared before I went to bed and to be quite honest when I explain some of the things happening, if any of it has anything to do with why some are scared at times, I can&#39;t really fault them, but there were some that were said to have been put into a spot where they felt that was the only choice but I also heard another spirit channeling through at one point and said that they had seen enough in which was partially why certain forces where in a certain area in the spirit.<br>- One of things understood was targeting of certain futures by certain spirits potentially cornered in a certain manner or done in a certain way. It happened in my office room as events unfolded. <br>- I went for a walk in which seemed at the start of the walk to partially be in regards to some of the situation unfolding. A shift in regards to planetary in certain manners and different kinds of interaction letting know of the things that had happened in my computer room where there had been certain implosions and switchups. <br>- I decided to put certain documentation later in the day in play to help with things behind the scenes. When I got back from my walk in which I did a decent amount of verbal advocations and not necessarily in apnick sort of way in which I did traverse to Sutton from Jackson&#39;s Point which impacted events that unfolded on my end in a certain way. When I got back I started working on the other kinds of documents.<br>- It was thought that I was going to put 20 documents into play this day but I actually put more than that into play. Earlier In the day I put into play, (AJHD) Toronto, (AJHD) Lake Simcoe, (AJHD) Keswick, (AJHD) Sutton, (AJHD) Newmarket and (AJHD) Ontario which helped situate certain kinds of areas and to have physical disclaimers to a certain extent online in regards to that sort of thing can be a decent help but there already is multiple kinds of spiritual documentation in to play anyhow but a decent supporting capacity nonetheless. <br>- I put some more documents into play: (AJHD) Knights of Apollo, (AJHD) Visualization Access, (AJHD) Alex James Hislop and Others(defined by my Main Camp) Frameworks, (AJHD) Alex James Hislop and Others(defined by my Main Camp) Frameworks Utilization,<br>- Near the end of the day I carried through with putting others into play: (AJHD) Earth-Based Dinosaurs, (AJHD) Triassic Park, (AJHD) Nimmaiss Dragon Games, (AJHD) Tursenis Showdowns, (AJHD) Grylderos Tournaments,  (AJHD) Truthers, (AJHD) Trayden Dimensional Existences.<br>- I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for the creation of the information that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.  <br>- The Events that happened in regards to Earth throughout the night need to be listed and understood. Multiple events happening. Certain thresholds crossed.<br>- Earth Channeled through me and some of which combined with me in certain manners while I was sleeping. I felt that I was a part of Earth and they insisted that I might be Earth, like a certain human encapsulating and being part of Earth in certain manners but I am not certain if the insinuation that I was a part of Earth since Dinosaur times can be true can it? That was a subtle insinuation there but I feel that there is a very real aspect to this storyline and interaction in regards to myself, I felt like bigger beings in regards to myself woke up for a time in which some channeled through to say that we need help. Like being able to move parts of your body in which have more weight that I am able to gauge as a psychic-medium, moving your head to the left and it feeling light and then moving it to the right and it feeling heavy, indication of moving certain layers to yourself in certain manners in which regular folk might not be able to fully discern. Earth really felt like he was not just channeling through but parts of him were a part of me and the insinuation that some were saying is that that was a high up content experience but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the case. It leads me to believe that what dimensional rights and dimensional fen shui to make people think that there should be places without dimensional rights and what kind of dimensional rights did we lose being masked as a content experiences need to gain dimensional rights. <br>- There was a smoke and mirrors in regards to certain thieves yesterday but also probably a revelation that there is certain kinds <br>- There was battle throughout the night again, two groups said to have been channeling through in which I feel was a tactic to try and harm an alliance and coming together in which might have been doing decent in regards to certain culture, it makes sense why it&#39;s been so rabid in trying to make people think it&#39;s been certain culture attacking me and other as well as each other in some sort of War in which might exist just not in the context that some think. Let knows though that there is a battle happening and a War taking place.<br>- The process also went hard to the way of utilization of my mechanisms away from my physical for certain reasonings. Reminisce of the Flotilla storyline and things of that nature. <br>- Multiple things as well upon going to be this moment where it looked to be certain kinds of time events taking place as well as a big switch in regards to incarnation, interaction and conflict in regards to a certain kind. <br>- Channel affected and certain speech balls potentially stolen having have said that i need to speak with the channel but I am not certain. Again a moving of process mechanisms being masked as something else in which in the mix certain kinds of stealing took place. I felt those that rely on my water affected as well and my circulation, moving outside circulation zones which I could feel as a psychic to be cutting off circulation. Also certain kinds of wiring, like when you smack your hand on a table and the slight electrical pain that is sometimes masked as contact pain being switch to something else, a different kind potentially tethered to tensor strength and grip of hand. Right foot affected like feeling bruising easier and a switch of certain kinds of on the right foot near the the two small toes inwards. Foot arches potentially affected as well and the smalls in regards to myself potentially attacked. Multiple visions and flashes, some of which almost like like physical television in HD. <br>- Peoples potentially moving and gathering there things and moving things away, there were those packing things up into me, like convoys moving through me insinuated to be moving things from Earth. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for the Items of Power that my Main Spirit Guides indicated to be gathered and brought where my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. <br>- The splitting of those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated needs to stop. What my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light needs to be displayed daily in the Areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for the (AJHD) Vendar Dimensional Existences information to be created and constructed as well a protected the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>- I Discerned a certain kind of Original Creator on the way if not already here in a certain manner as well as certain kind of deployments, incarnation and backup because of some of the events happening around myself and others as well as in the Spiritual. I feel this to be true. <br>- Again there is certain groups in regards to Earth that has been identified as to be a certain kind in which is potentially pinned down in a certain manner as per some of the conflict in regards to Earth. The hookups and combining in regards to Earth needs attention if some of those bad characters are combining and utilizing the name of earth in certain manners. <br>- <br><br>Advocationals:<br>change<br>Post<br>Resources and Supply defense<br>Let knows in regards to What I and others(defined by my mian Camp are choosing in regards to what my Main Camp indicated in regards to June 13th, 219 and June 14th, 2019<br>Safety and defense in regards to Banking and Financials as well as those that my Main Camp indicated,<br>Post and shipments in regards to those that my main Spirit Guides indicated<br>Post and Shipments in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated. <br>Advocations in regards to June 11th, 2019 and June 5th, 2019 as well June 2019 in regards to Manpower, Research, Viability, Logistics and Peripherals.  <br>Cry for &#39;Not Doing it!&#39; from those that would hit home in regards to Content Experiences.
