<div class="title">(08/23/2019) &quot;Crazy and Battles&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>- Early Morning attacks in regards to Psychic and Channeling, the have continued to use spiders to harm me psychologically. I have noted multiple psychic stimuli over the past couple days in regards to the utilization of spiders and other kinds to scare me. Partially lying about my desentization and certain kinds of behaviour updates, taking it away and changing it in key moments where I am confronted with these scary visuals and instead of using some of those updates upon seeing some of those visuals utilizing how I feel in the physical if I was to be confronted with certain kind of things partially by way of the reaction and scare tactics. This is partially because of how I feel in that I don&#39;t want to be desensitized in a certain manner because of how I feel in regards to some of my fears and things of that nature. <br> There is different kind of personality and behaviour updates that can happen in the spirit and for some it can be as quick as uploading and downloading a personality trait. In which can change how one proceeds in a certain situation. If you get attacked with spiders psychologically by way of visual imagery your personality is going to be different and to be truth there is those holding it down in certain aspects of certain selves as to how they feel in certain moments. I have noticed moment capturing in regards to certain psychologically damaging moments and scared and crying moments potentially by some of the negative to use in a certain manner. There is ones for the positive as well too that have happened and even some of the negative are utilizing such a thing for decent means like creating content experiences for some to vent aggression instead of it happening in other contexts. <br>- There was also discussion about life path direction and utilization of such things in regards to other processes to affect shaping of those processes and certain events. Like some operating under a life path that I am no longer currently on in a certain fashion to affect the world at large but it&#39;s not just myself, it&#39;s also others. Imagine the spirit be able to utilize a dimensional overlap of how things would have turned out had a certain life path of your and others continued to have been approached, like becoming a doctor and  coming up with the cures to diseases, and certain spirit being able to utilize that overlap in certain situations and reactions as well as shaping of people had that life path taken place and therein lies life utilization as well s some even pretend to be certain kind had they have gone the life path direction. The shitiness of it all is those trying to alter life path then to say that those overlaps are a certain kinds in which are there to be utilized in a certain fashion. God, it really does lament upon the crap of it when there are those trying to alter life path to utilize those overlaps and life utilization in a certain manner. <br>- I have discerned something to do with Fathers these past couple days as well as sons at times in which was lemented upon in a certain moment to partially be affecting myself and others. <br>- Basically woke up this morning in the gutter and feeling still crazy from before. Multiple kinds utilized throughout the night but as the day progressed I got better and yeah, no where nears what some have gone through especially the utilization of my life to take the hit off of punishment alternatives and other kinds. There are those taking the psychological impact in regards to some of the stuff done to me, like other dimensional buffers standing in the way of me feeling the full affect of what ever the heck they are trying to do to me. How many others have this sort of thing in the world? <br>- Big battles emerging with Kaiju Spiders and things of that nature in other dimensional existences. This time when I stood on earth I could feel certain aspects of earth go a bit crazy by way of certain psychological utilized in my process. I prompted attack in regards to some that were attacking others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, my promptings are only supposed to do what my Main Spirit Guides indicated for a reason, I lost my cool in a certain moment and its&#39; just how I feel, I am tired of dealing with a certain kind that continues to harm us. I want the to go and I don&#39;t want them in my process. <br>- Power utilization regarding myself the past couples days has reflected both decent and indecent. Some of it having to do with labeling me a certain kind in certain moments where behavior manipulation and personality influencing to have certain actions taking place to be able to say why they would steal certain aspects of my process, qualities, mechanisms and traits. There has been a certain kind on me as well in which shouldn&#39;t be mistaken as well as utilized in similar manner. That in which certain aspects of other processes on this earth-based supposedly, often having to do with famous personalities in which there was a thought to somehow link that some of the behavior and negatives in regards to the way I operate at times equated and somehow brought fourth as to the reasonings as to why some of others qualities, traits and things of that nature have been stolen. <br><br><br>Advocationals:<br> - Asking the Light to look at it from different perspectives and also asking what he could in regards to that sort of thing upon asking the Light to look at from different perspectives. Like different analyticals, critiques as well as observations. <br> - Advocating for Entertainment regarding those following a process especially those pertaining to increase of views and things of that nature so as to create recreational and willful for some. How to convince those to willfully tune into a process and what kind of entertainment can be done to facilitate this. <br> <br>Themes: <br>#PowerUtilization #Media #Transportation #Earth-Based #Crazy #Hurt #Psychologicals #BatleForEarth #Doubt #Decency#Civility #Judges #ToughFemales #Psychic #Channeling #FacilitationOfEntertainment<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
