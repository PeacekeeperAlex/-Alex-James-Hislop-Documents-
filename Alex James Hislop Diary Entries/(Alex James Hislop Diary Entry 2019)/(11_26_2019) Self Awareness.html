<div class="title">(11/26/2019) Self Awareness</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br> I wondered yesterday somehow the if events depicted were all a dream. A moment passed over me where I saw a platform and mic spiritual manifest around me in which had to do with letting know about the Light and about people who did things like me in the past on this planet and people who would do thing similar in the future. That they don&#39;t experience certain things that have been let know happen to me in which I feel a portion are not true anyhow. How can I accept some of the darker things some of the spirit have insinuated at times, the answer is that I can&#39;t. You would think that certain kind of spirit that come around and have conversation through the channel with me about this subject in a markdown sort of way especially considering the amount of topic and discussion in regards to whether to use energy placements in how we feel to remedy situations without being realistic about it or to approach with realism would be understood for what it is, but sometimes it&#39;s not simple like that, sometimes things are grey. I love grey and dislike it. It speaks of great story if not the best but a shitty reality of situations. An event takes place behind the a scenes, it&#39;s said to be a battle and that your positivity in that spirit are going to be ok might be the difference between certain spirit making it through that battle. Some want to approach with positivity but there is a problematic at times with some using energy placements to ignore a situation instead of looking at it realistically. There are also those that would have some be realistic about it and utilize that as excuse as to why certain energy placements can&#39;t exist. <br>Are those who utilize such energy placement defensives and reactions to blame in regards to certain conflicts being ignored? Not really, it&#39;s a battle for frig sake in which many other kinds of spirit can view and understand the situation. The leaders need to be accountable especially if citizens are being attacked and thrown in the mix specifically if a decent portion laments upon some of the citizens making things worse. If though there is places in which are affected by energy placements, real energy placement that exist and you can look towards your emotions to give you proof that energies and impression exist that lament upon an understanding that we experience and talk abut daily throughout life. We have a word for anger, people know what it is about and there is an emotion in which laments upon it. What about the stuff we can do spiritually? Belief, Faith, Intention, Intuition, Motivation, Gratitude, Apologetics, impressions and others energies in which we can create daily through certain spiritual machinisms and anatomy in which exists. As a psychic I would note that this is the case and that there are different energies bodies associated with us to be able to achieve this. that we could create anger in other places or even other emotions talked about like, love, sadness and joy. We never did fully understand some of the things that our own emotions and some of which was influenced from the spirit around us actually fully did. It&#39;s the same for some of the other stuff. Belief in a certain topic throughout your life in which some never fully understood or recognized that some of us were actually creating energy placement with such things as belief throughout our life. I was one of the ones that did grasp and have a baseline understanding a step up from what my live societal understood in a certain manner. These energy placement I could feel as a psychic to affect things in the spirit and in regards to myself. An energy placement of belief that I and others were calmer would sooth and invoke calm and form the energy placement I would feel it lend towards that in which was believed in. Was it visually seen behind the scenes like a cloud hanging over me spiritually? I discerned there to be colour association with some of the energies like a certain kind could visually see it but others not, either way the energies discerned I would note have a stronger affect within certain spiritual, that the calming belief would affect those in certain energy realms more so myself and just as I could discern spirit at times in subtle fashion I wondered if the beliefs that I could discern in subtle fashion were more intense for another spirit in which was confirmed at times through spiritual communications and experiences that scientific extrapolation spoke of that being the case. when of course we use energy placement to affect an outcome, do we need to be realistic about said outcome? If being realistic about that outcome would change the variables then some would say no. There are those ones though in which I have noted as a psychic who has witnessed and discerned battle, to be ones that affect battle. <br>There is a conflict that takes place, in that conflict I put fourth a belief that say the defenders of such a conflict that my Main Spirit Guides indicated are going to win such a battle in which I would want to have happen to a certain degree. It affect things by way of that energy placement but does that mean I can&#39;t be realistic about the outcome of such a battle? No. For some though it&#39;s not so simple. There are certain kind in the spirit who always look at a situation in a certain way. For some of them they always have a positive outlook on a situation, it&#39;s a certain ripple affect that exists that can change the variables of what they come into contact with. Of them there are a certain kind that still react and are realistic in regards to but just because you don&#39;t react energetically doesn&#39;t mean that you are not being realistic, some might view certain reaction to be disruptive but as a regular physical earth-based human would say especially considering upon those that don&#39;t know about some of the spiritual, I am only human. Reaction exists and it&#39;s a part of life and in regards to natural reaction of a certain kind they would feel that to not be able to react a certain kind of suppression at times. Although when you look at it from a spirit perspective that would be impacted by energy placement and reaction to such degrees especially when looking at it from the perspective of would you speak out loud in which would alert an enemy that was trying to harm you near by, the answer on that becomes more simple. I would not alert the enemy for what&#39;s acceptable and I do care about spirit in how I affect them given context. It&#39;s partially why some of us rely on proxy information and direction in the spirit. <br>Is it fair, I seem to be searching for that in life in which the spiritual has both told me of the enlightened in a small but powerful manner at times but also the danger in a bigger moderate way. In certain places fairness is not factored but it exists and the ways of operating interestingly enough by a large percentage factor in such a variable. Some spirit don&#39;t care but their are a larger portion that does. It&#39;s some of the spirit rely upon the truth and positive of what some preach. It bring hope and tells of a different tale. Maybe it gives hope to the other sides upon believing the opposite. Reality exists though and sometimes it comes knocking at the door of hopes and dreams. You can&#39;t destroy a dream, not truly and that might fly in the face of what certain realism culture speaks about at times. Maybe that is partially why you have some so upset at times though. On one hand we want to be realistic for as much as we can be and the question as to whether that&#39;s achievable in certain areas remains a question at times maybe lending towards hope. While on the other we still want to be able to have believe, hope and faith in things. We still want to put fourth an impact for some and for others that isn&#39;t the case. <br>On one hand you have culture that says to be realistic you need to be fully that or have an unfair amount of realism approach which speaks of unfair treatment in utilization of certain energy placements. The decent of this is some consider them fixers and have a handle on the situation. Coherent. At least it&#39;s not one step away from the equilibrium style anti-art culture that scares the shit out of me but maybe in understanding that perspective and why they do that I would have a better idea of  existence. On the other you have another culture in which says to not be realistic about things and just ignore certain variables almost in a surreal sort of walk past the problem kind of way. This might have to do with what I mentioned earlier in that there are some that approach a situation with positivity and for some not necessarily address and by that way they lend towards situations.<br> They speak of the same thing at times though as ever much as they are on the opposite sides. Is it really those in which distort and cause ripple effect woes upon the actions of some? This paragraph too much? No, what is too much is something else. Because there are those that exist in the spirit the utilize certain concepts in which is in line with an agenda of goodness. That might be the scarier part about it is that it&#39;s not just sanctioned by some authority but sanctioned a good authority in which has proven that this direction is valid.<br>This moment where certain kind came around spoke of a moment in time, i think that it was and what i spoke about had to do with safeguarding certain kind like me that do informational placement in certain ways, one of the few physical humans on this physical planet currently supposedly. It was supposed to be a good moment and was but I think some mistaken certain kind trying to help and a ripple effect that happens upon that sort of thing. Later at night it looked like more spiritual attacks to be true or as certain kind of detour spiritually. like being shoehorned in a certain area where channel is hard, where upon a lot of channeling feels to be of air this felt to be of earth. A subterranean in which I discerned spiritually, a cave of sorts supposedly having to a certain area and spiritual in which was observed in the light of unfairness. Again a certain kind tried to disrupt and vented some stuff in regards to Authority, God and the those that my Main Spirit Guides indicted in higher light for whatever lunacy they go us into. What ever reasoning upon coming from self, family and friendship, and Origin that speaks of well to do organization and planning that would ever turn into the decaying heals of the world we live in now. No, it&#39;s not all dark and the healing that exist from the decay accents a direction in which I used to agree with and no longer can fully agree with. Why would some want to put multiple societies together behind the scenes spiritually that are so different, some would point towards a learning to get along mentality but other might point towards destroying ourselves and that&#39;s the brilliance of it but it&#39;s not all smiles and excitement. It&#39;s not all happy about a direction that many care about in the spiritual mending that exists. In fact I would hazerd a guess that many of them hate this direction, even the die hard and maybe that&#39;s the brilliance of it too. It&#39;s not the only direction of course which must be lyric to the ever famous song too many cooks in the kitchen and for a psychic to discern what kind of directions are existing to heal us and for us to be able to get along in knowing that immorality culture exists behind the scenes lends towards perceptions of mixed cultures and direction in which is not necessarily a true reflection of what some are trying to go for and enact. Such is the lot of life and trying to pursue such direction especially when interacting with those in front of the scenes. I saw aspects of this yesterday when they tried to start affecting the energy placement and validity within  how I feel and what I lend towards in a power sort of way and of course there is many lines that could be taken for reasonings of good are seen through by the light. If you do it for good for true even if you forgot that you are supposedly doing it for bad, the light understand and can see through that bullshit. The light a literal setting that exists seen within near death experience because god forbid we don&#39;t throw a couple lines to remind that these are spiritual matters like talking about Hollywood and other kinds of machinisms isn&#39;t spiritual in nature which some spirits find to be malarkey while other maintain that to be the truth. Either way it&#39;s convenient but in this process doesn&#39;t hold much salt to a certain degree because we know that the spiritual extends in a certain manners. What is the point of disrupting my path spiritually upon conversation, energies and communication from the spirit realm to try and portray me as erratic and incoherent specifically when I making more sense than most. Does this seem like a bad guy move to you? Would certain spirits trying to label you crazy upon you being a psychic medium lend fourth to the credence that there is positivity, enlightenment abound? It was the realistic understanding and faith in Origin that brought a lot of us to the remembrance and protection of sanity to see through the negative placement and understand that that the spiritual exist. It still makes it difficult to tell when a direction employed pertaining to what I am sensing spiritually at times and it can be confusing especially when a process is going a certain direction. Continued back and fourth subtle in regards to process alternatives, life utilization and other kinds upon multiple themes in which some of it had to do with who needs who more. <br>Another thing that happened yesterday had to do with a layer moved in which felt to be an in front of the scenes, that affected blood pressure and a stabilization regarding pertaining to a medical healing in which was more in front of the scenes. Almost like what cause the blood pressure drop was a natural wrap affected and certain spirit replacing parts of it holding the blood pressure at a high enough level to be dangerous. I can feel spiritual influencing in regards to some of the ailments I have felt, like diabetes and other kinds in regard to some of the stimuli being influenced from the spirit around ourselves. Natural systems being modified by the spirit in which is being replaced with alternatives potentially. I felt another kind being invoked today which had to do with lashing out, vent areas an other kind in regards to spiritual responses. They put an aspects of myself on me in which felt to be in this process when I was younger, specifically reminded of my Aunt. An angrier version of myself in which speaks of sadness, anger and happiness and reminded of cyclops. Near the end of the an argument and influencing took place in which did not help the situations, pretty much a lame duck of a day on my end. <br><br>- (Woke up quiet and I am not certain what took place to achieve that. They moved me to self systems in which I felt a solitude of self be affected, some trying to move crowd away from me seemingly but some can&#39;t be moved. Either way though I think they were either trying to disrupt systems of self, point something out or even awaken a spirit of self. It can feel that way but we need to understand if I consider that spirit self in a certain manner.)<br><br>Informational Placement:<br>Gaming Teams that my Main Spirit Guides indicated<br>SEO Teams that my Main Spirit Guides indicated<br>in regards to the best possible advocations that I and others(defined by my Main Spriit Guides) could have advocated, calculated by the setting that my Main Spriit Guides indicated and cross referenced with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated and the Main Spirit Guides that my Main Spriit Guides indicated requested pertaining to November 26th, 2019 and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides)<br>in regards to viability in regards to the best possible actions I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) could have advocated, calculated by the setting that my Main Spriit Guides indicated and cross referenced with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated and the Main Spirit Guides that my Main Spriit Guides indicated requested pertaining to November 26th, 2019 and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides)<br><br><br> There is of course those in the middle.
