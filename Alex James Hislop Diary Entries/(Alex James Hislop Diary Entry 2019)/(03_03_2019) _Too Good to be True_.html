<div class="title">(03/03/2019) &quot;Too Good to be True&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Off the go things have been quite strange one of things being talked about on my end I think is that of some of the things that were falsehoods and reputational attack, also the forcing of cards and saying cards were played when they weren&#39;t, I am sure I have made my fair share of &quot;Hey, they played that card&quot; and walked off, but i am not certain I want to go that route any longer, I am fairly certain I have not been meaning to go that route at all. It dawn on me that to able to utilize certain technology down here would change the course of a lot of different stars. Specifically that sort of stuff that be utilized by way of other dimensional behind the scenes through intention and other such mechanisms, my body feels like it limits myself but the truth remains that it sets me free and can be used in many different ways, how can I use consciousness and perspective as well other means to be able to affect things behind the scenes but can I trust that what I am doing is fully what i intend and not that of others. I played a bit of Elite Dangerous and the game is quite superab, I felt myself get put into a content experience behind the scenes of galaxies and stars is what I was assuming it was but I am not fully certain. I went to Nonnas today and she was well. She seemed well and in good spirits, another sort of thing felt was certain spiritual light opening in the post Mario Larocca Passed on. When I was on the way home, and Grande Cheese and H Mart, seemed like there was a lot spiritually going on at least on my end, as well as Value Village, we stopped by there as well and it seemed there was spiritual turbulence. A lot of different kinds of Faith energies as well as tells in regards to Angelics and Demonics, just because I don&#39;t lament upon the themes written down in the Alex James Hislop Diary Entries, doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t understanding or interaction in regards to those themes and a lot of the times I haven&#39;t been writing these themes to have something created in a certain context. There was this Trickster storyline in regards to Jamie, Jesse and myself as well as certain tells throughout the process. There was also tells of Jesse and DIllon being a certain kinds of leader in the past and that a certain trickster might have been a part of it but I am not certain if either are the truth. The thing of it was though, there is decent reasonsings not to harm myself and others and considering how high up at times this goes, I wonder about some of the reactions and interaction that have happened, not to say that being a thor type character or trickeresque archetype is deserving of some of the brimstone responses. On the way home I sort of felt like I was resituated with certain kinds of passengers as well as experiences certain NEar Death experiences in other dimensional existences. My perspective was affected, I know who I am and I my opinions remain but there is this feeling of certain kinds of head area trauma in another dimensional sort of way but I wonder if it has affected me. There was this moment where I was watching Battleship and I felt myself get put in a certain kind of drivers, seat, almost like a spotlight and awareness was in my vision and body. More viewers and platforming in a certain kind of way, potentially in regards to certain atmospherics and boies within my process. I sort of asked why it was that that would be the case, why certain spirits in opposition would do that as well as the opposite, I thought it might have to do with the realization that I am supporting role in a certain kind of way and that that work s and suite me. There was other reasonings though, some of which had to with putting the attention back on me when it wasn&#39;t just about me, there was people earlier in which I had a moment while watching certain content of acknowledging realization that there is others in this process who are looked upon as in the hot seat and others, and it sort of changed my process a bit which didn&#39;t agree with some. I continued to watch and it was fairly story heavy in regards to myself and I didn&#39;t really know how to respond to another let know regarding qualities and atmospherics of others being similar to my own as well as potentially more than that. Mid way through it became evident that there were this feeling that I wanted to let know in certain moments about the idea, dream and vision pertaining to certain existence creation, something in which I feel already exists and has continued to exist in myriads of different forms. One of the things that is a part of it on my end is being able to promote immorality in certain ways even seemingly in a realistic way with choice and safeties that my Main Camp indicated, one of the things I looked at was that of what do we have to lose in certain situations even without certain safeguards that my Main Camp indicated. While I was doing certain advocations it kind of felt like behind the scenes and even in front of the scenes I was put in a spot where I started defending, I feel there was attacks happening in a certain kind of way and although it was insinuated to be in regards to certain kinds of dimensional existences with certain qualities that be somewhat different than other dimensional existences, somehow it looks fairly similar and real and I can&#39;t shake the feeling that some of it still went down in places outside certain atmospherics. I feel the way I do because I know there to be existences and creation in which exist that can facilitate the ways of life desired in many of peoples and that the defense pertaining is able to withstand certain forces and have the Cover, Resources and Manpower to be able to defend. I had done a hand full of advocations that pertain to what my Main Camp indicated and some of it was revealed that it was potentially an event that had already happened that things are underway but I do affect things to a certain extent especially if it was one of those things where my actions impacted, I understand there are groups out there who feel that was necessary but I continue to go with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated, there are things like that, peoples only listening to their leaders, commanders and authority that come with certain things, a that or nothing approach that&#39;s understood, it&#39;s similar in regards to myself and my Main Guides as well as others(defined by my Main Guides), this is not new and I am wondering how not new it really is considering the amount of stuff that has happened and not so within my life. All the while I felt the need to do a handful of advocations last night, partially because I felt like there was something happening behind the scenes, my main guides gauge that on their end and facilitate me being on a break or any other kind of lifestyle. If i was to say I didn&#39;t want to do this anymore they take it into account and so does my dimensional selves for what&#39;s acceptable, compassion and care is quite important in regards to myself and others that my Main Camp indicated in that regard. There was this moment where I discerned spirits being upset but the real upsetness I feel stemmed potentially off of certain comments in the conversation, some of which weren&#39;t meant as they sounded and either way I am not certain it would be enough to warrant a certain kind of response especially if it was mainly in regards to opposition and doppelgangers getting attacked Was there warfare happening yesterday or is this everyday? A certain group came around near the end of the film and I felt like dimensional baddies and higher light were clashing. Special forces kind of feeling and certain kinds of groups were around me in another dimensional sort of way. I watched Train to Busan and it was sort of revealed that this head throbbing I get is sometimes associated with a certain kinds of spiritual metamorphosis. Almost like spirits could hop in these areas but it feels more physical and in front of the scenes, a more physical nefelibata realm. A head area feng shui kind of felt like a certain kind of brain setup creation but it was more than that, mover  and shakers of physical were around me and it just got to that level where certain physicals were doing a bunch of stuff. Then there was this moment where I felt like someone tried to shoot me in another dimensional sort of way, went into the head area and it was eventually let know later on that that bullet was actually helping potentially by way of psychological safety, still the way it was done made me think it was also something else in multiple kinds of ways.
