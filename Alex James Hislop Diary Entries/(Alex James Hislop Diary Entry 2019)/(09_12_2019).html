<div class="title">(09/12/2019)</div>
<div class="content">- I felt a certain kind of anatomical cutting on the chest area which has seemingly made it more difficult to breath and I am wondering if there was other damage as well in regards to connections and things of that nature. It seemed to me that sometimes heavy breathing has to do with other dimensional alterations that sometimes happen to some of us but I do feel there is decent regarding. Yesterday Spirit were chiming that I was seperating or splitting with myself in a certain way but I think that&#39;s bullsit in a certain manner. I think some were told to leave and I think some have been moving me and shaking certain kind down, in the mix is the incarnation and afterlife transportation conversation having to do with the kind were transportation at times, its beenentioned about another kind that is transporting some that left me and I am wondering how they are fairing. Nonetheless this talk of splitting and combining with spirits is very much real and as a psychic I have felt stimuli to support it. I feel this had to do with certain aspects of me in a certain context potentially but some in which might have to do with something else, maybe aspects not of me in a certain context, I am not fully certain. Some were trying insinuated that there was a falling out of lovers and loved don&#39;t some of my anti-camp, maybe even aspects of myself pertaining to my anti camp but I don&#39;t know how much of it is bullcrap. There seems to be some who would want me to be writing about some that have broken up potentially to cause it to happened or lend credence to something that might not have happen but if it did happen I would say to look your memories and for also some to take a look on certain situations. They keep bringing up certain forms in this process which needs to stop I feel especially if it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with me and others, I know form utilization for some is a certain kind of freedom and I do have a liberal viewpoint regarding and in the mix realization that certain forms have certain meaning but we look at the facts and it continues to try and be utilized against in certain fashion.<br>- There was said to get some that were targeted yesterday in a certain capacity having to with lovers and loved ones. <br>- God spark retrieval also talked about yesterday to a certain extent as well as one of ideas of the more deployment we do the more God spark gathering potentially needs to be done but I thought of it as simplistic instantly gathering of God spark upon a certain length of time pertaining instantaneous transportation to the places needed to go in which does exist.<br>- There was also emphasis yesterday in regards to utilization of a certain kind of voice framework partially in regards to a certain kind of disclaimers in which I feel was uploaded to a certain degree in the peacekeeperalex Trello account in which I uploaded another copy on the peacekeeperAlex github account.<br>- A certain story interaction in the morning on my end, smooth story Feng Shui in which seemed to be the bad guys although the form utilization and voice utilized was of good character and the messengers of it was potentially good as well. They are also potentially good Spirit as well maybe put in a bad spot, heavy emphasis in a safe that they are good in certain dimensions and them being able to say it potentially help. They pointed towards a certain kind and said I go after them in a nonchalant future telling kind of way. They also tried to say I wasn&#39;t going after the shark, which technically I am not, been trying to help the shark but rather said to be a certain kind. There was also reference to a certain kind going after lovers, loved ones and love in a certain fashion in regards to the first group that I was supposedly going after and it was referenced as the new Pennywise. The shark was referencing Original Dimensional Bad Guy Family, Mobsters.<br>- There have been tells that good story has been around which segwayed to interesting conversation. It&#39;s the idea that story a certain kind traversed from a certain area but the joke was that it was already here, good story anyhow, maybe not the kind that has been here today. The ones that say that we can look at certain kind of interaction and tell that even without my own testimony that there is certain kind around some of us at times. Memory, quick one second look at the physical tab for some and what ever it is for other dimensional. Thought mechanisms for some of us not always being the same and a portion having difficulty with thought mechanisms in which could be stream less and lets know of certain interaction. Water being drinken is another tell as some are not drinking enough daily which does correspond with spiritual mechanisms that let know that you are thirsty, mouth content becoming dry letting know that water is needed and also spiritual rememberall in head are not firing off upon needing more water. Food urges being more than what is seemingly needed again urges I have felt to be spiritual in nature and influenced from spirit around. Dreams not being remembered as often as they should is also another tell and vitamin retention upon food consumption not being what it should be. Of course those segways to another sort of thought in which some dislike upon the tells that there is good amongst us in many different ways. You can look towards Faith to be one of the let knows as a good amount of them are moral and have calming energies around themselves. Kung Fu masters is another in which lets know of spiritual goodness in the world. The amount of Peace being perpetuated in contrast with the amount of war and sure bad attitudes supposedly and violent video games should not be enough to warrant some of us being shoehorned around those that would attack and harm us regardless of if some of us consider it to be holding it down in our own way. The real truth though is that I don&#39;t think were suppose to be placed spiritually around some but I do see the reasoning, some in which might be to calm some of the more spiritually angry as well as create bonds of fellowship but when it gets utilized against us in such manners and when it ceases to look productive it is a tell especially in regards to warfare and conflict upon utilization of such interaction systems to advance what some were escaping, mainly war and hatred amongst ourselves to the ever mistaken labelment of some. But I really feel that for some of it, it&#39;s not suppose to be and we can look towards two things in which can help us in our pursuit upon if ever we realized that we were placed spiritually in the wrong area or that if we wanted to reside in another area of peaceful spiritual interaction. 1) Even if this goes back to caveman days where we might feel that we are placed in the wrong areas spiritually, we can always point towards what we want and desire as well as what we should be given freely, that of safety and quality of life, check the opinions of the percentages. What we desire matters. 2) If it&#39;s not from caveman days than we can point to what it was before and it gives us a tell as to that it wasn&#39;t always this way. Potentially lending towards that we shouldn&#39;t be placed in such ways. What is the other dimensional standpoint on this, there version in regards to earth based. God I want safety for them too to be able to promote the ways of life they want but if you don&#39;t step forward and say do more than just say than how can you expect it to ever be. and don&#39;t pull that bullshit. <br>- I had my feet on earth for the past 4 or 5 hours. I had some Channeled conversations but mostly quiet, thought pivotal moments, some of which told of one of the things in regards to that emotional feeling of being scared of life and not knowing what to do at times, that there was suppose to be someone that guides those kinds of peoples in a certain manner. Another had to do with how I incarnated and thins of that nature talked about in a certain manner potentially in regards to whether I was forced incarnate and i do feel aspects now combined with me might have been the case. I had the (AJHD) Alex James Hislop and Others(defined by my Main Camp) Master information document on earth near amount the same time as I had my feet.
