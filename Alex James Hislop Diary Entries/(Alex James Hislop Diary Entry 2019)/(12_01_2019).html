<div class="title">(12/01/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>With understanding some of the meaner and more hateful cultures behind the scenes, the brimstone and the immoral, I find it difficult to let go and easy to leave behind. There were moments where I could have dropped everyone, there were moments where I wanted too and there were moments where I went back, moments where I looked back and thanked god for whatever reason that I didn&#39;t. This doesn&#39;t just pertain to me but it pertains to others as well if you haven&#39;t gotten the clue yet. When someone speaks, I can catch the dual meaning. When there is a body language, I can understand the influence from the spirit. That when we express ourselves the is another kind expressing through us and at times is mixing up which is which. For some on this planet, it&#39;s no big deal in a certain sense being that it is understood who is who. It&#39;s not always that simple for some though. You ever have a moment where you say words to a person that your speaking with in which comes off the wrong way? As a psychic I have been able to feel the placement of expression from spirits around ourselves similar to being able to discern the different between emotions in which are influenced from the spirit around oneself and that of willful emotional creation. I would be able to note the difference and start to understand the double meaning. How important can an inflection change be in a conversation. Turning an answer into a question, that&#39;s fairly important but it&#39;s the little things actually that I find myself noting to be the real kicker. Someone coming off antagonistic rather than friendly observed in a Cinema Dialogue in which the script in the physical might suppose to be friendly and the script in the spiritual potentially not so but it&#39;s small noting of observations in which I have been seeing and experiencing in which has lend towards understanding a small portion of the double meaning, the triple meaning and whole lot more. This context explained is everything. An expression that someone conveys that at times as a psychic I have come to understand that there is expression with body, a spiritual overlap that some don&#39;t fully note in which is sometimes passed of as the expression of the physical and other dimensional, to be true some call it an other-dimensional overlap at times and it can be a part of the physical and other-dimensional. Why say other-dimensional as well? Because it&#39;s not just in regards to the physical and going down this rabbit hole might be a long one but the noting I have been able to see and sense as a physical psychic and the experiences I have had especially within the confines of channeling and spiritual communication let me know that there is similar in other-dimensional. That there is overlaps and layering of dimensions in which not only exist in regards to physical. That there is similar experiences and probably even expanded that exist on both sides of the lines for some. I find myself in the middle of the road in how I want to proceed with my process between a certain kind in which want me to focus on the positive and the spiritual. That word right there tells of the good work the spiritualist communities have been doing in the physical and other-dimensional in regards to earth. It speaks to me of goodness, of truth, letting know of some of the experiences in which exist and the amount of positive involved is hard to deny. But there is another world that exists. It&#39;s this world that I have noted at times within my experiences within the past five years that I have a difficult time just totally walking away from and also certain spirit have a difficult time with just letting go. It speaks of similarities upon the disagreements that we have had at times. It&#39;s another culture in which I have been lamenting and have utilized as a stone upon my own experiences, a backdrop of where I am coming from in which speaks of similar culture if not the same as what the Spiritualist Communities have been letting know of for a while now. It&#39;s this let know of beings of light and other-dimensional that exist that are of the good. Some in which still play violent video games<br>I don&#39;t understand how it is that for a year solid that some would lead me down a road in which didn&#39;t speak of the what the good books said. Maybe it was a future discerned. I am not fully certain but one of the things that pulled me out of that place was love, experiences and realism. It&#39;s interesting to note that I would be arguing with certain spirit about whether I am psychic or mentally. Does a crazy argue with the imaginary in which he perceives to be real? At times some doctors might shake their heads and agree. I am not the kind of crazy that some think though. One of the realizations was that what I was experiencing was real upon the stimuli I was experiencing. The hard facts of the experience laments upon a either a desensitization of the mentally ill in what they are experiencing or potentially that there is a large mislabellment happening by something in which the Doctors don&#39;t fully know how to explain yet. The beautiful thing about it is that it&#39;s happening in a time when the bridge between Spiritualist and Doctor is partially being mended. The doctor that looks upon the physical many of which study the phenomenon as to the science pertaining and if the doctor could for a moment hypothesis and level to say that let&#39;s imagine that what Spiritualist are saying are true, then wouldn&#39;t that mean that a portion of the Spiritualists that study that phenomenon be considered scientists. It&#39;s a difficult to understand that there could be fore running pioneers that went through some terrible experiences behind the scenes spiritually in which would impact their life enough to have to seek out help in which would be eventually misunderstood by some of the most brightest of us. The dictation of society is partially upon the scientists shoulders in which the doctor shouldn&#39;t bear the burden to be true. If it was to be true that those experiencing mental illness were in fact psychics and spiritualist in distress maybe misunderstood to be scientists of other dimensional, I feel that would indeed be a shame. <br>These experiences are interesting to understand especially getting back to the point as to how certain things have unfolded in my process. The excuse that I never watched enough spiritual content is not enough. You know it to be. It speaks of some of the regular folk at times in what they have been through in that some of them are not experiencing the enlightenment that has be talked so much within spiritualist communities. Even though we see regulars people passing on and a cornerstone of some of the spiritual research relied upon in the Accounts and experiences of those in outer body experiences and Near Experiences that let&#39;s know that the common do go to places of enlightenment and that there are those in interaction upon which want them to succeed. What though are they experiencing behind the scenes spiritually if it is not always this enlightenment. A big part of the conversation has been interaction. This darker world has been discerned and I am not trying to upset by way of letting know of it and not going the way of only talking about enlightenment, one of the key difficulties on either side is that if I am experiencing certain negatives at times it can be difficult to talk about the positives and if I don&#39;t talk about the positives the riffing that some can do in creating that positive is limited but not as limited as some would have you believe. I don&#39;t feel for a second that spirit world that I know couldn&#39;t facilitate a ripple effect from someone who only talks of negative to be positive. Some would say it&#39;s exactly what you are trying to point out as to why it can&#39;t be the that in which say the Spiritual World could facilitate. I could take it a step further upon what I know and what I feel to be true which what really could be said is that I don&#39;t believe that the Spiritual that know couldn&#39;t facilitate a positive ripple effect from societal that speaks of partial negatives at times to be a large portion positive. heck I don&#39;t believe that we couldn&#39;t facilitate a balance upon negative and positive either, partially by way of sadness and depression. Either way it&#39;s the small stuff that shouldn&#39;t be lost. Talk of big lines shouldn&#39;t white wash certain things and at times it doesn&#39;t. Maybe the bigger topic point s what exactly are those spirit taking the hit in regards to ourselves going through. I tend to feel that what we are going through and what they are going through to be important. Some want it to be a we in regards to both but for some of us it&#39;s not possible. It&#39;s been made not possible at times. <br><br><br>Informational Placement<br>Construction and shielding<br><br>Recovery Circles<br>Therapy and Therapist, Psychology and Psychologists.<br>scrums<br>Loot Based games that can give things in Heaven, that can mean something when you get that loot in certain dimensional existences, utilization regarding for recovery and other purposes<br><br><br>Themes:<br>#Construction #SIlence #Gaming #Shielding <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
