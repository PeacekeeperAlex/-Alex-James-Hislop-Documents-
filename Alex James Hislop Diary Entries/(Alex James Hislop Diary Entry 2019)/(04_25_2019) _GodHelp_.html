<div class="title">(04/25/2019) &quot;GodHelp&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Advocational Reaction moving upwards and cleaner dimensional areas insinuations that the areas I am in are a bit different and that I am traversing to new areas. There was also different talk about certain spirits that had been scattered in a certain manner but the tell that just because some people have a quality of certain spirits doesn&#39;t indicate that certain scattering of qualities and such have fully happened. Either way advocationals would be decent. There was reaction already in reaction to the catchall healing information and the catchall war disclaimers that i put into play. I have felt certain systems change in regards to my food, I was utilizing the scarfing down kind of food systems that my main Camp indicated which switched to the enjoyment and taste kinds of mechanisms, eating slower and enjoying food more. There has also been tells of exaggerating my process and others(defined by my Main Camp) especially in regards to my Actions, Non-Actions, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) and the kinds of level of Fame Situating which at times ebbs and flows partially because of the kinds of spirits combining with me at times and not in the behind the scenes and in front of the scenes setup. I had a conversation that was really cool in regards to how I would want to approach certain things in regards to being able to promote certain kinds of immorality and seemingly. Myself and the physicals on this physical planet take violent video games a bit for granted but imagine it become more realistic in holodeck programs that look really similar. I think the physical earth based society and others that my Main Camp indicated might view it a certain way based on the information that they have =, potentially put certain restrictions but upon the revelation of what some of the other existences are experiencing potentially put certain things into play in which would be more lenient. Ways to streamline and deal with certain things in other societies where holodeck programs are introduced right off the bat in certain ways rather than going through the technological advancements and time periods that lead up to that sort of stuff. We play video games, we adapt to VR, we create Advanced Vr where when we look at holodeck technology that it looks fairly similar, we get to a point where it can look ultra realistic albeit subtle differences where it no longer has that cartoon sheen, what&#39;s the difference n going through those advancements in technology and time periods to those that get that holodeck experiences right at the start. The idea is that some society might say that that ultra realism and set certain boundaries in play and depending on which might not be a bad idea but the other thing of it is that there is still ways to be able to introduce that stuff into society even when streamlining wait and technology in what some might consider a certain kinds of instruction manual. I don&#39;t want to say behavioural but it really does sometimes depend on information, if we know there are those that like to promote immorality in ways where we would evaluate how we approach immorality and that we could facilitate that kind of thing in certain kinds of ways in which could help different places then the revelation and exactly how that revelation happens can matter greatly. There is this kind of change within my process as well that has been happening, this moving away from certain kinds of anti-camp interaction in which is being replaced with this fuzining of life utilization as well as in regards to my own self, a supposed merging in regards to Anti-Camp and opposition in regards ot myself partially based off of holding down life below certain thresholds in which I may not be able to traverse but in which I want to traverse and have put thing into play to traverse but in which I might not always be able to stay where that life utilization partially comes into play. The idea that some who are utilizing my life could be another aspect of myself or even seemingly in a certain way, like my physical perspective intermingling with my Carndis dimensional self if I have one the way my Main Camp indicated. There has been this idea though by those working against me at times in which has been amenting upon the idea to utilize the seemingly bad things that have been happening to the anti-camp aspects of myself in which to then two fold say that was actually just the bad part of me and not the enemies in which were trying to harm but also to then utilize it to try and get me more harmed in certain ways. It become interesting when you factor in the origin theory that we came from something like a bigger being that at times might look at us and consider us to be part of himself. I wonder at times if it&#39;s not only a tactic from anti-camp but also a let know or an opportunity, an offer and a hope. <br><br>Advocationals:<br>specific targetings protection in regards to those that utilize the things that Alex James Hislop Fenbo44 put into play, especially the AJH Earth Doing Callwords<br>Researching and understanding who is targeting and attacking in regards to the advocationals, testificiationals, clarificationals, disclaimers and others(defined by my Main Camp) of those that my Main Camp indicated as well as why. I have a worry that there were those utilizing certain kinds of stuff in regards to antagonize those that are on hookups that rely upon those not experiencing decent. I am hoping for hookup exchange defense the way my Main Camp indicated. <br>The utilization of my Process and Processes that my Main Camp indicated. <br>Being forced to utilize different kinds of undesired immorality<br><br>Defense:<br>The Idea of different peoples working on different issues in regards to life work and the kind of life lived I don&#39;t find to be a problem, the idea that someone worked on his life and moved past certain issues having to do with immorality and things of that nature if some even tackled issues like that in which I feel exists partially by way of the potentially fact that there might be some that have never promoted immorality or know what immorality entails. The problem I have is the fighting and arguing in regards to which issues are more important and the lack of understanding in regards to what exactly some are going through in regards to quality of life, pain, suffering and other kinds of stimuli while factoring in and prioritizing in All That Is. It is important for people to understand that there are large groups of peoples working on other kinds of issues that don&#39;t have to do with immorality and morality promotion but at what point do we not analyze exactly what the ripple affect augmentation is in regards to those that are not working on the issues of Quality of Life in regards to those are promoting immorality. How does that interact with some of the issues that I and others(defined by my Mian Camp) have been working on and why is it that we would want to work together. <br>Quality of Life and those that have a certain Quality of Life potentially have a certain kinds of stage. The Rights issues regarding this is important. <br>Energies with certain levels of Awareness protectors defense. Certain Energies in places where there is less of awareness in regards to certain things having certain kinds of awareness to try and help situations. There should be a lot of safeguards in play to protect these kinds of energies but like a lot of things that I have noticed it just hasn&#39;t been fully the case in regards to enough protection existing regardless of whether it&#39;s normal or not. It&#39;s the same answer.
