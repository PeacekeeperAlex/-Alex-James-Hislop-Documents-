<div class="title">(03/29/2019) &quot;Limbo A Go Go&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I discerned different kinds of self stance seemingly and there is this emphasis at times in regards to how rigid I can be in regards to how I feel, that doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t get along and it doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t compromise but I know upon knowledge and faith in which tells me these truths that make the current events of what is taking place to not make sense and yeah I am not privy to what some understand and know but it&#39;s enough to shape my direction and choices down here, like aligning oneself to certain stances in which to gauge when Far Away Light would actually intervene in regards to saving the contrast of what happens up above and down below and the stark unfairness of what happens below compared to above and in we flip script does Far Away Light then say it&#39;s enough, the answer is variably yes, they do in a certain manner, many peoples have that line of don&#39;t attack my family or those ones for some but it was just the outing of this line and emphasization of understanding that some of us up above have forgotten or no longer care about those below. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t want those up above put in a situation where they have to venture fourth and have their lives ruined, or losing rights or have loved be harmed but rather have someone do something about it instead of this piece meal bull shit. Just not enough of us to care in the moment to not have anything have happen but just enough to chip us away to we a decent sized have experienced pain and suffering to such a degree, some of use first timer regardless of whether you compare that to those who have never been harmed from the beginning or those who seemingly young ones who have never been harmed, I talk of soul age in regards to this. You compare those two groups and the care regarding really does send a message. <br><br>Defense: <br>If it is as you say and there was things pulled from my life to facilitate the future, past,present, like documents I was going to be creating and pulling from it then how the heck was all the harm and hurt happen in regards to my life while pulling from that stuff especially in regards to the moments in which I needed to safety and defense especially in regards to those that are innocent in all of this. Not to mention all of progressional and monetary implications. So the idea is that some have been saying that certain things have been pulled from in regards to this life and at the same time some only have been facilitating upon myself creating certain things, cause if i didn&#39;t lets just ignore the obvious as to what needs to be done a certain kind of facilitation on certain ends to claim that the decent of it was them for what&#39;s acceptable ubt at the same time not actually do the stuff that I missed for what&#39;s acceptable. I create an Earth disclaimers document and the amount of things happening in regards  it being a mixed bag, some of which happens to be those facilitating only because i put it into play and some of it is pulled from an earlier point potentially, not fully certain but said to might be the case in a certain way. So there are some saying that it wasn&#39;t me regardless whether it was or not. How important is it to know certain things and how important is it not, to protect by way of not knowing a life and what it could do? OK, but why the heck did that life potentially get attacked so much, where was the protection for those who needed saving, especially prior the actions actually happening. There is this mindset change in regards to me in my process yo just facilitate certain things that I might do in a certain kind of way and while decent I feel that there needs to facilitation of economic ripple affect and deceleration tactics as well as acceleration tacts the way my Main Camp indicated. There is a point and line that is quite damning in which is being hidden away in which has to do with the amount of harm and damage has happened within my life as Alex James Hislop and others(defined by my Main Camp) as well as that in which has been pulled from life in which asks the question as to how the heck is that fair specifically in regards to  the others circumstances that my Main Camp indicated. The let know of experiencing life within a big being, you go incarnate, you live your life and then pass on and then see that ibgger being and how much timed has passed, ike imagine 100 minutes passing in his time when that might be too long but it seemed to you to be an entire life and then there are ones where you hit home and get back and the bigger being has aged considerably, has my bigger being aged considerably? Being in the physical on this physical planet earth lets me know that the near death experiences point towards heavenly afterlife in a lot of instances for physical humans and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The international travel seems to be lengthy at times, meaning there certain things traveled at length when we live our physical life on this physical planet earth or some anyhow but in my life there has been insinuation that I have lived long life, like dimensional existences that I am not suppose to be passing by in such time in which ahs potentially been passed. Like if there is normally in certain internationaal existences, a single life being lived in a year of my physical time rather be seconds and minutes at times. Looking at what the information I create down here turns into especially in regards to other taking it over specifically if it&#39;s going to be stolen. Advocations in regards to returning mechanisms and facilitating creation in regards to the ones that were unreturnable. <br><br>Advocationals: <br>Groups of peoples in which to create Disclaimers and Advocations especially in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to those that are utilizing the lives that my Main Camp indicated. Positivity happening when you promote seemingly immorality as well as immorality in a certain way and not having to do with any after stuff for what&#39;s acceptable. Karmic tetherings to streamline progression. Messenger and Diplomats. Rights document for the eventuality of certain beings leaving certain spots, like certain process document I have been creating and things of that nature in regards to energies that my Main in regards to Therapeutic Brimstone Deployments that my Main Camp indicated in which are harmless in the ways that my Main Camp indicated<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
