<div class="content">Activity:<br>For some there is still turbulence and battle happening the storyline yesterday of something being over may be true but there is still stuff happening and especially if it was ruse needs to be understood. There has been this let know and realization that I wasn&#39;t trying to go after immorality that there were certain groups and peoples as well as others that my Main Camp indicated want to be able to do what my Main Camp indicated and it&#39;s not all the same as a lot of what my Main Camp indicated through my writings down here in the physical doesn&#39;t always pertain to a single thing for what&#39;s acceptable, and for what&#39; acceptable in regards to myself and others is defined by my Main Spirit Guides. Anyhow, the idea is that there are those that my Main Camp indicated that want to have what my Main Camp indicated in regards to this marking, advocations, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) and most if not all do not want to be attacked the way my Main Camp indicated. I realized that if this is not achievable in the existences that my Main Camp indicated, as there has been a lot of different kinds of talking as well as battle and bloodshed, then I would want to achieve this elsewhere in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. I am asking the Light to do what my Main Camp indicated in regards to this information the way my Main Camp indicated. I started looking at my life and if I have been attacked down here in such ways has been insinuated and at times still being attacked in certain manners currently, not just in regards to Alex James Hislop Fenbo44 but in other kinds of lives especially if my actions and non-actions as well as what my Main Camp indicated were to be blamed in regards to what has been happening in regards to the life that my Main Camp indicated, Death that my Main Camp indicated and not so that my Main Camp indicated, then I started pondering the possibilities of starting to pack up in certain capacities. That other dimensional selves of myself might have been attacked in ways unthinkable in which did nothing wrong and even if they did do something wrong, the thought of being attacked because of certain actions emerges in which I feel is quite unfair. I thought what if I get back, and look at all the incarnations that I still had located below and I thought that I really wish there was someway to painlessly transport them to safe areas that my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for what my Main Camp indicated in regards to Painless nihilation and other kinds of ways of transporting those that my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated.  <br>Defense^<br><br>There was moments of training, downloading combat training, at least it was brought and somewhat thought to be. There was this idea of attack point where in lengths of lives, futures being seen in spiral fashions and even into the future some in which revealed certain kinds of points within life, imagine not looking at life as it happened through one singular viewpoint and seemingly but rather at these timelines and grids of moments, weavings and shapes of life in each strand could contain multiple kinds of times, moments and other kinds of machinisms and philosophy and being able to change moments while looking at these sort of things. Where your life is affected and ripple effect understood. <br><br>Ability - Power - Creation - Destruction - Guidance - Knowledge - Memory <br>Abilocreadeguidedgory <br>- Ahh - bil - o - creadeh - guidedgory -<br><br>Content: Assassin&#39;s Creed: Themes that has been going on in my process ever present anyhow for the past couple months and more so, it&#39;s the same answer, the need to be able to facilitate violence in different way to be able to stave for who we and be who want to be, the balancing of that emerges ever clearly important and this conversations between two groups and multiple groups talked about before, that god gave us free will to act how we want to act and those that would be able to facilitate that in ways more real than what some of us have experienced in the ways in certain kinds of life and for some it&#39;s not to take freewill away but rather augment it and let know that there are still those that are there if want to have have. Those that would eventually arrive at the doorstep to persuade otherwise and the letting go of certain things to get their but the true percentage would be, arriving at that point where some would want us to stop playing our games and living our life to be something different, something were, something we ought to be, but for some, never again. It&#39;s why that conversation is won and lost for what&#39;s been already lost and to be lost and gained. Why do we need to let that dream be in the conversation and not so. I happened to agree with both in the way that my Main Camp indicated, i and others(defined by my Main Camp) agree in the ways that my Main Camp indicated and not so in the ways that my Main Camp indicated in the highlighted sections that my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. Free choice and healing of who we are can still exist in a certain capacity, to understand there are those who still want to be evil and still want to be who they want to be needs to be understood and so does the line of needing those to emerge to save us from ourselves, to understand that we have changed and no longer deserve to be in the areas that my Main Camp indicated and if possible to understand the context that God gave us freewill. The metaphorical themes of that are throughout the film and games of Assassins creed, the templars representing Authority and the mending of who we are and the Assassin&#39;s Creed being the underground and Freechoice.<br><br>Defense:<br>Back Defense as well as trusst let knows.<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
