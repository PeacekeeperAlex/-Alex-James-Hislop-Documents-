<div class="title">(11/01/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Mood: Quiet, <br><br>Activity:<br>- So I can feel that there is an honest conversation. Throughout the past couple I have noticed a certain channel through, I feel comforted and happy that they around me. Then they cut off from the Channel at times, there will be multiple instances where they will channel through for 20 minutes to an hours time but then there will also be moments where they only channel for ten or fifteen minutes and sometimes only get a word in before something seemingly happens and is often accompanies with energy discernment that point towards events and sometimes turbulence taking place. Windy energies also energies that let know of that something is wrong. This really did remind of the one day a couple days ago at night upon trying to go to bed in which was one of the worst depicted in regards to this phenomenon. This might be related to another story line about smooth type fighting in regards to this process. <br>Speaking of negativity what the heck is with some of the attachment in regards to the video games I play. I have noticed story line like when I play Shadows of Mordor this latest attachment having to do with a certain kind being outed. Is this normal? Is this an every time occurrence when I play this games. What was insinuated at first was that a certain kind that has been operating as the good guys were then figured out and told to be not so. This was let know as I write this that it might have been partially from some of the events taking place when I was playing this game. Specifically a couple days ago though in which I can sometimes see moments when I played past corresponding with the energies that some are trying to say are associated with the story lines depicted. For example I had an earlier save from 2014 in which during this time frame playing the game in 2019 there was a variable in regards to time frame conversation potentially between spirit and talking points from 2014 to 2019, I believe it to be subtle and done in a certain manner. There have been multiple games where I feel like there is certain storyline being perpetuated in regards to certain energy placement and impressions in regards to the games themselves as well as certain experiences pertain to when I am utilizing the games. Dead Island is another and this reminds of that experience in which was talked about where a certain game systems deployment as well as content experience deployment and systems utilization was brought around in which was so said suppose to be for some of it to be mine. What was elaborated on is some of the spiritual stealing that is taking place in regards. <br>I thought of something yesterday upon going to bed. that my grandparents remind me of certain animals at times especially upon elder age. The Polar Bear and the Koala. The Gorilla and the Monkey. I feel there is wisdom in regards to all four especially the Monkey.These are archetypes in a certain sense and I still don&#39;t fully know why these four animals I am discerning especially upon the shaping of certain qualities pertaining. <br>There was big changes happening a certain kind of interaction took place in which is being labelled of self. Like a certain kind of spirit overlapping me went into the vicinity in regards to my interaction for the past twelve hours but also longer. since yesterday and the day before to be true in regards to what I discern. It feels good but also there is disparities at times in this new direction pertaining to some being targeted. There is<br>Throughout the night I think there was a big talking point from some spirit in regards to conflict management and whether some of this is real or not in which just happen to coincide with certain events discerned on my end in which seem very much real. Colossal events in certain places to be true. I think that it&#39;s a mixed bag in regards to some of the event depiction in that some of it is entertainment in which a portion of is real but some of is not necessarily what some think. Real events taking place in which has less to do with entertainment. <br>Another thing that happened past couple days is talking about seriousness in regards to events. Imagine we have certain spiritual beings that are small in nature. Imagine we are bigger compared to them. Imagine watching a basin the size of a football field fill up natural through a natural disaster in which certain smalls were affected. Imagine there was millions and billions of smalls in this basin in which there is homes, work society and culture and that this flood changed them and hurt their way of life. The seriousness to such an event needs to be understood and is partially understood in this instance by the numbers of smalls listed. If we compare to an event like a continent on earth being affected weather patterns in which was devastating enough in which the entire world would be watching. Would there be a comparison there is energy in regards to the spirit and other kinds in which desensitize in regards to certain things. How people to respond to such events really does.<br><br>(Strong arming of others so said to be from me and my Main Spirit Guides and so said to be helping m when it really looks like a certain kind trying to do certain actions to upset others and myself.)<br>(Movement of  a certain anti-camp associated with the Anti-Camp story line in which was thought to be related to pro camp anticamp fight and saying that I am one or the other but also another story line in which  has to do with my irritation but not all of it in which reminds of earlier process.) <br>(Inter politics pertaining to the dimensional in regards to myself and in regards to self)<br>(I brought up a certain matter of the situation in which was refreshing and what I am looking for as a certain kind continues to try go a certain route and display why they were angry in regards to me. The refresher held the truth of situation in which I am referring to what my Main Spriit Guides indicated. I and others were tired of this one look lens as to why a certain was angry but rather wanted to the truth of the situation.)<br>(Spiritualist versus seemingly related to Process alternatives story line and flotilla storyilnes)<br>(This idea as to what we know in the dimensional live and the overlaps and dimensional existences pertaining to interaction in regards to who we were down here specifically the ones pertaining to the experiences throughout the entire life from birth to death and then to experience for some new life and dimensions leaving off where we passed on. Some were noting on my end upon awareness and observation has created interesting variable in regards to some of these interaction upon myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.)<br>(Seriousness in regards to events - Sigils, Markings, Statues, Stones, Art, Urns, Remembrance and other kinds in which <br><br>Informational Placement:<br>Defense Teams that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to the Peacekeeperalex Trello Account and Others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) Advocations (AJH Daily Defensives Board - x388 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br>Defense Teams that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to the Peacekeeperalex Trello Account and Others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) Testifications (AJH Daily Defensives Board - x388 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br>My Main Spirit Guides in the Original Light are in Charge of my Spirit Guides Chain of Command in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light.
