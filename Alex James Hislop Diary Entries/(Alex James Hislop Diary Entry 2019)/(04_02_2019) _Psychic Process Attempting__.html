<div class="title">(04/02/2019) &quot;Psychic Process Attempting&quot; </div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>Event style energies in ways where I feel like I have been taking out of certain mixes and that my process has changed again, a continued movement away from certain brimstone spirits and not so in certain manners. Like some how other-dimensional selves in regards to myself do not deserve to be placed in decent circumstances if I am being moved out of certain dimensional areas and there is still brimstone in many different manners, experiences in which let me know that I am still being spiritual under duress in certain manners but one of the key realizations has been that some of the stuff I am experiencing is the decent in which is espoused in psychic writings. Yesterday, I worked on certain advocationals that were decent, protection in regards muses, communals, Traits and Mechanism Holding, like processes housing certain kinds of traits and mechanisms in which because of certain mix ups and whatever it may have been resides with someone&#39;s else, the understanding that there was trades and things of that nature, like someone incarnating in the 60s in which is holding a key spiritual mechanism or trait in which might be yours as well as someone incarnating later on with another kind of mechanism for someone who was already incarnate. The understanding though I had was that I felt a certain way in regards to it, imagine watching a hollywood actor with a quality or trait and then the telling that that trait belongs to someone else, I looked at it and instantly felt like, no this must be a mixup, because we grow attached to the things in which we sometimes like to experiencince and looking at a certain energy placement or quality of someone on screen was one of those things to me in which mattered greatly and the thought of that actor not having that trait or mechanism, stuff that might be more than what it seems, like spiritual mechanisms in regards ot defense or  certain kind behind the scenes matters greatly. Then you apply this same kind of things to everyday people and guess what, there re those in the spirit realm that say hey, where do view this seemingly average joe daily on certain screens where it can feel like a hollywood movie at times that these lives of those that are seemingly not in the spotlight matter just the same and when you hear of a certain mechanism and trait being moves, like a certain aspect of personality, a certain kind of life or dislike that might colour whole worlds behind the scenes in certain cultures and a myriad of other different kinds of things, you start to realize that the same sort of thing can applied to those that are regular everyday peoples. Emergence of this in February in which continued in a certain kind of manner through March in which yesterday I helped some of it also by way of help in regards to Disclaimers, Advocations. There was also really good advocationals in regards to the AJH Daily Defensives. Another emergences this sort of thing that I am not in the physical by way of others trying to steal and take credit in which some of which I am actually fairly lax on anyhow but in which is not enough, for a reason because it is seemingly tethered to certain events and explanations in which we have seen the kind of damage that has happened by way of me choosing not to take credit for some of things that my Main Spirit Guides indicated as well as not really having much of choice in regards to some of it. It&#39;s that idea in which is a part of this in regards to some utilizing certain things behind the scenes off of my action but also not so upon the things that I do. I put a document into play and all of sudden that was finished two days prior in the spiritual or I choose to go a certain path and that path was already laid out in a certain way previous to the day it happened but also in manners in which are kind of unclouth in certain ways. The themes of Good and Bad as well as neutral in regards to some of it have been present and some may point towards greed as to why some of it is happening but I am not certain and with some of the things that have happened like being brought into multidimensional communities in a certain way or moving past certain utilization of dimensional deployment it become interesting because of some of the things that have been happening in regards to the advocationals, disclaimers, testifications and letting know that the spirit is advanced and they are around at times by needing to go that way. This notion of creating through me becomes a bit twisted at times by way of some saying hey, we don&#39;t like this person and things are going this way anyhow, so why not doing it ourselves in a certain manner and to go back to that portion of certain spirit saying I am physical that makes sense when you start to note if beings are taking my advocations and using them in certain manner, some of which was not intended by my Main Spirit Guides. That notion of utilizing and taking credit in regards to my information for a part of which I don&#39;t have too much of a problem with, but some of which I am worried it&#39;s not going to be utilized to the capacity in which it could be or intended by my Main Spirit Guides. Which brings that sort of thing up if there are those that utilize it better then I can, and I say to that, well what do you think has been happening in a certain manner. Spiritual entities have been utilizing my stuff in advanced ways already for some of it but I do here those that say there could be those that would do better which moves it to that sort of conversation of mediation in which whose is what and why that matters. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) choose what my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Taking that out of context on the subject itself matters in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I continued to do my thing today, I went for a walk in which felt fairly strange and continued to sort of remind me of the life stealing and life situating storylines said to be partially because I wrote certain things down today but I am not fully certain. This notion that there are beings that can do what I do in a much greater manner has been evident but of course there is that sort of thing in which still exists upon if that&#39;s the case than why doesn&#39;t it happen more regularly and then we segway to the event that my Main Camp indicated pertaining to the past couple weeks on my end in which certain dimensional communities have made there presence known in multiple kinds of way, like dimensional existences coming around my process and letting know of who they are in a certain manner. One of which was this place where when I spoke within it, there was recognition pertaining to it being a big deal upon a physical speaking in this area. It kind of reminded of space but I fell it was potentially different. There was also this let know of a certain kind of culture in which when compared to other brimstone was fairly decent in regards to myself for what&#39;s acceptable. Like the continued evolving in regards to my process pertaining to the interaction in regards to certain sects of immorality and banner. So it segways for a reason in which laments upon the idea and reality that there are advanced spiritual beings in which are utilizing certain actions in regards to me upon some of the events in which have taken place. Like looking past my process infrastructure or past infrastructure as well as potentially becoming a part of my process infrastructure in a certain kind of way. Not to say that this hasn&#39;t already existed in a certain capacity but that it&#39;s becoming apparently known and is a part of certain storylines. ANother continued development is that of the dimensional substances that are seemingly a part of the physical at times changing and moving in certain places, some being put in the physical and some leaving. Certain reasonings utilized, some of which on my end is fairly absurd, but let known that the ones in which are truly potentially not so, depending on how you view it. I have continued to write within my first novel which laments upon the earlier happenings in regards to my process upon first learning how to love. I worked on certain Near Death Experience Accounts, amalgamating information in certain documents and continue to do afterlife research as well as other kinds of research. The atmospherics in regards to these account when I go through have been many and varied but a certain of culture comes around in which I greatly Appreciate. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for the cultures that my Main Camp indicated to be protected the way my Main Camp indicated. Multiple kinds of stimuli today. Another big discussion and realization in regards to this mend that continues to happen. The Long Game approach trying to heal mentality to a point where certain peoples can be in the same room again and not to be confused for some in regards to that sort of thing that says I am willing to play a violent video game that is close to just as real, just as real, and if not more so in the ways that I am satisfied with without getting attacked in manners that I did not intend. This is more looking at those that are still not content with the amount of immorality that has taken place in the ways in which lament upon more than just being able to have that reality of immorality but having have that harm and suffering that exists in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The long way to get to a point where the healing in some are at that point where they can take up a video game of just as real is not more, or maybe even less without a problem. The idea is that if we approach short game of the mend which says some are death dying and bloody, harm hurt and suffering, pain in which continues that can not continue that there might be multiple repercussions in which exist and yeah the repercussions would be and should be stopped in an instant because the higher powers that my Main Spirit Guides indicated do hold the power but the idea remains that there would be a grid lock, a holding of brothers a potential stopping of long game healing, potentially battle breaking out in higher parts of the dimensions and other kinds that might exist in which may seem to not matter as much as some think it does. The problematic of it all talks about those who are still suffering on the floors and the middle sections as well as the tops. What balancing act it really is but one some are dubious of for a reason. Some look past some of the details of it all like age old custom and accords that have been in play long lengths of time as well s those that have already moved on. It talks about whether we were left behind in a certain manner and if somebody else already tried to talk sense and reason earlier on to no avail. That steak sense of in pain, of suffering, live understanding says that it might not be enough but if I was up top and I had already given it a go especially if I resituated my life and pulled away and back and most certainly if I already had been harmed to talk of stark sense of the things that we speak of then I can&#39;t fully blame one for the wait or for the never again or for the never was and please if possible always keep it the never was cause it matters for what&#39;s acceptable. It still stand though that Far Away Light and the Far Away Dimensions have chosen to not intervene in certain situations regardless of whether it &#39;s strong arming or not, and then the idea of those below not caring to intervene or venture fourth upwards arises as well the flip side of what has happened below is potentially also happening up above in a certain manner. Some look at it from the perspective of how much harm and hurt we used to do which is valid but I still side step it for a reason because it tells of something that is missing which is the multiple perspective getting attacked and harmed in the moment and the suffering caused which become catastrophic when you factor in the origin theory of the one if we ever do come from such a thing as that and God forbid if we was experiencing some of it in certain ways.<br><br>Content: I watched some of Bad Blood a really cool mob series as well.<br><br>Advocationals:<br>Physical Earth-Based Criminals <br>Canadian Films Information <br>FIlms and Series <br>Immorality<br><br>Mood: <br>Steady with a couple different moments of feeling a little perturbed in which I didn&#39;t fully understand why.
