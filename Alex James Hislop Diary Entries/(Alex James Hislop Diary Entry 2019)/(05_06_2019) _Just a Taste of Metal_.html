<div class="title">(05/06/2019) &quot;Just a Taste of Metal&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>Kind of felt like someone attacked near end of yesterday and today some of which was said to have to do with certain key points which makes this whole thing look a bit over the top. One of the situating that was tried to have done again is the connection and communication issue but interestingly enough who the heck are they to limit are connection and communication in such ways anyhow. People ask where authority is at times and the answer is that they are around and trying to defend, just because it feels like they aren&#39;t doesn&#39;t mean there not because they are. In fact, I can&#39;t help but feel that a decent sized portion of certain wars were situated and won in regards to some of the events that have taken place today. <br><br>Medical Observation: <br>Tasting metal and I felt metal stimuli in regards to my inner chest area, head near thought canal as well nose area and it feels like my tasting is being suppressed.  I can feel this stuff happen and the spirit interacting in regards to it as a psychic. <br><br>Defense:<br>Access to bodies and areas in the manners that my Main Camp indicated, we know that portions of Far Away Light and Far Away Dimensions could intervene in the manners that my Main Camp indicated, we know those bodies to exist which can transcend dimensional boundaries by way of what my Main Camp indicated. We know them to exist within the capacities that my Main Camp indicated now in the manner that my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. If those that my Main Camp indicated cannot get access to the bodies, atmospherics, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) as well as areas that my Main Camp indicated then we need alternatives. The difficulty in regards to the alternatives which is potentially related to the life utilization issue is that there are those groups that have been targeting and trying to stop those that my Main Camp indicated in being able to save and protect to gain access to saving through life utilization and alternatives. The second issue has to do with the kind of saving that happens in regards to the amount and kind saved as well as the peripherals in regards to that and how many times we see peoples not be saved and defended, and if there is so many damn alternatives then why t the heel are those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated getting attacked in the manners that my Main Camp indicated. You can&#39;t suppress the truth on this, it&#39;s the common knowledge that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and the conspiracy isn&#39;t what I have been talking about in the Manners that my Main Camp indicated. So you take stock into account all of the need saving and ultimatums in regards to that but if we are not given what we need to be able to achieve those savings then why is it that we should lose access to our own lives in regards to that? not to mention all those that perish and get hammered in regards to the limiting of access and don&#39;t claim some timeline scheduling bullshit, those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated don&#39;t hear about that. Top priority is saving? I started reviewing past Diary Entry Content in a certain manner for eventual uploading and one of the things that was let know along with other topics was that of past content being facilitated by the spirit in certain manners. If they are insinuating the Alex James Hislop Diary Entries and the other kinds of content that my Main Spirit GUides indicated then how is that the case when that let know that I hit the scenes in a certain manner and not many people know of me in the ways that my Main Camp indicated.  There is a wire crossing that my Main Camp indicated wich points towards certain spirits utilizing the fact that they did not know who I was in the manners that my Main Camp indicated yet if the content that my Main Camp indicated was created especially anything with the name Alex James Hislop as well as what my Main Camp indicated then what does that mean? Light do what my Main Camp indicated in regard to this paragraph. Listen to their actions that my Main Camp facilitated and do what my Main Camp indicated with those actions. <br><br>The killings through me, metamorphosis feng shui and those that suffered in regards to not being saved. IE being moved pas t a threshold and still feeling like someone or certain allpersonal are being harmed in that areas lik i got moved in a certain amount of times and that there are those suffering in regards to my body and atmospherics. <br><br>Mechanisms and abilities (I don&#39;t always write down everythings that I did and in some diary entries I actually am missing a decent sized portion in regards to kind of abilities and Mechanisms that I utilized in which I am trying to remedy by listing some of the activities I did):<br>Taste<br><br>Advocationals:<br>Earth Records<br>Those that my Main Camp indicated facilitating my Content that my Main Camp indicated. <br>Embedment Teams that my Main Camp indicated. <br>Stars aligning advocations to understanding my life and others(defined by my Main Camp)<br>Th advocations and content that my Main Camp indicated in regards to myself and others(defined by my Mian Camp) earlier on and the reasonings why it ended up the way it did. <br>those trying to facilitate in regards to what my Main Camp indicated in brimstone places.<br>roller coaster experiences in regards to living life and those that experience life <br>those that went the way of behind the scenes information matter and the thought that alex might copy and past the AJHD) information in a certain way but there is still let know that copy and pasting in certain manners can still be reflect the information desired.<br>Those mapping down the changes in name and other kinds in regards to my content<br>Those being forced to read disclaimers and advocations in unfair circumstances. <br>Those not being able to let know that they do not want to be attacked albeit feeling a certain way in regards to compensation and what exactly that means.  <br>Those that do overlap response in the past and present as well as future in regards to myself and others(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. <br>Specifics advocatinos and talking point defense in regards to my Content that my Main Camp indicated.<br>Overlaps that my Main Camp indicated in regards to my content <br>those losing access by way of not wanting to proceed in different instances in regards to morality promotion <br>interaction frameworks in regards to listening to past content and the content itself in the manners that my Main Camp indicated. <br>Psychological defense in regards to my past selves.<br>Industry utilization in regards to myself and others(defined by my main Camp), Is that ok for any of you?<br>Those being blamed in regards to industry utilization that don&#39;t have anything to do with it other than what my Main Camp indicated, stealing being utilized to harm in multiple kinds of ways <br>Why did I get this life?<br>Asking those that my Main Camp indicated in the moments utilizing the Cheat Sheets that my Main Camp indicated in the Light. <br>The Game Setup Spirits <br>those that let me know of what my Main Camp indicated and the spiritual interaction in regards to certain things especially long game<br>The attempts to harm and attack myself and others in the future. <br>Light heal me if I am the bad guy in the ways that my Main Camp indicated, we have seen the technology and have felt the technology to exist<br>What I and others(defined by my Main Camp) choose in regards to <br>spirits revealing and giving information.<br>resources in regards to brimstone and utilizing brimstone cover tactics<br>awakenings and sleepings<br>those being able to operate the way my Main Camp indicated.
