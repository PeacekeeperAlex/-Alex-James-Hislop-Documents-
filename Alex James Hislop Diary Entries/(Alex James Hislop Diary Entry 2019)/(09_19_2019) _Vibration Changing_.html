<div class="title">(09/19/2019) &quot;Vibration Changing&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- Spiritually Attacked upon going to bed felt perspective affected. It was as if there was a bunch of spirits waiting in my bedroom upon going to bed but I was tired and not willing to get up but rather fall asleep. I did an advocation before going to bed but let&#39;s be honest it has less to do with advocations in certain regards. I was up throughout the night off and on, tossing and turning as well as up to get water multiple times. One of the things that some people don&#39;t note is certain spiritual turbulence within their lives in which upon being able to sense it as a Psychic Medium I have certainly been able to note. It has been ever changing and getting better upon certain kind taking notice of this process and to be honest 5 years ain&#39;t too bad in regards to a certain length in time but what happens if this is till being noted 10 years from now specifically with the amount of defense works and changes within this process. Is that what it&#39;s going to look like? I hope not and there would be something strange about it if their was. Either way again a certain kind getting to a certain point in which might have been a cover story but upon waking me up again and doing it a certain fashion there being that insinuation of spiritual turbulence in which if really happening I would want situated and understood. There was a branching off of perspective in which was labelled something in which wasn&#39;t necessarily thought to be at least in regards to what some spirit insinuated. I could feel spirit leaving my head areas to go to certain area in which knocked at the door of that sort of idea in which dimensionally has seen me be inside a certain aspect of myself inwards. Like portions of myself expanded overlapping my house in which portions of that perspective have gone to certain areas regarding and not necessarily leaving me. This constant battle in regards to saying that I am a bad spirit from some to then try and manipulate and facilitate certain kind as well as affect certain kinds of passengers in regards to my incarnation. It was felt the day before and the day previous to that in regards to certain kind leaving the chest chakra and other areas. Being able to feel other-dimensional anatomy affected by way of certain events taking palace behind the scenes. <br>- Another topic point brought up was about Wars that are similar lengths of time and ongoing to how I experience physical time. There have been many times brought up and in fact solely focused upon from sum within my process and a certain process spotlight pertaining to the kind of interaction where a battle could happen for 10 minutes and then a break initiates. The sort of thing where you could see wars and battle in the spirit happen for a certain length of times then change seemingly. There was a bringing up of certain dimensions where certain warfare and battle in regards to this process have continued to wage even in times frames similar to the physical. It&#39;s that idea and interest in regards to what would happen if a battle was to break out a month ago and some in the spirit and have had the same time experienced seemingly by myself since it begin in this instance being a month since. The ones brought up were 100 days and more in which I am not certain what it has fully to do with. Again my childhood was brought up in trying to discern. Angelics as well. I think it might be something else to be honest but the gravity in regards to this needs to be understood and with all of the smooth feng shui tactics we still need to remember there are other-dimensional existences experience certain kind of events some of which might have to do with this process which upon my own defense works might look a bit strange at times. <br>- A spiritual group looking past lines upon looking at what is happening to other dimensional selves and allpersonal especially in regards to influences and manipulation in regards to being turned bad behind the scenes. What was noticed is that there are spirits that feel a certain in regards to some of the tactics pertaining to targeting of other-dimensional selves pertaining to influencing and manipulation. Some are sick of it myself included. Some of the insinuations of other dimensional selves and the continued mentions that some are bad has reached a certain point in which needs to be understood and reviewed especially upon how some of the spirits that want this to end feel and proceed. <br><br>Dream: <br>I remember there was moments of my life earlier on in my life when I was younger in which were shoehorned in regards to story line that had to do with situating my life. The story-line correlated a certain kind of streamlining happening and not necessarily solely on my end but also in which had to do with certain kinds of dinosaurs as well as the idea of helping dinosaurs. There was moments in regards to my life in which looked like upon the spotlight and awareness that certain spirit have put on me and through working through this life there was another kind in which realized and understood that some of it might have been in regards to helping certain kinds of Dinosaurs in the past. There was also themes throughout in which were horrifying and was lamented upon after waking up in which I could discern those tones to exist throughout the dream. Whether or not some of the horrifying took place, that I am uncertain of and in regards to certain kinds of themes, we look around and wonder if it would be all too uncommon to see certain spirit setup and the answer to that is no. In the same breath though it wouldn&#39;t be too uncommon for some of those horrifying tones to be depicted and well see if it was that uncommon to see those tones be more true than depicted. There was themes of the past like continuing to go back to my life in the past when I was younger to try and help certain things. Depictions of Jungle  and flashes of my younger form when I was a kid. There were others as well but for some reason I continue to see defense teams being with me most of the times as well as other times when I would be looking at certain items and setting being somewhat representative to certain moments of my life and others. Dreams I have seen to be literal interactions taking place in certain areas. I have felt dream continue to play out psychically upon waking up and I have wondered if some of those nightmares where certain kinds of monsters try to get me have actually been able to do so or at least whoever elses is upon that dream when I wake up.<br>- There was a moment upon creating the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Content, daily Diary Entry Content I have been creating in video form in which by the end of the video there was a moment where certain spirit left this process and went elsewhere in which I am not certain what exactly it was about but there was some power shifts taking place in explaining that I am not the only in which is impacting certain kinds of content. I think some were trying to claim that some have shut down certain impact from Hollywood in a certain manner potentially to help in which I do feel there are some that the impact regarding has been  situated a certain way potentially not consensual either but still one of those things that I feel and especially in regards to the Actors that there is impact regarding certain content consumption and that we do affect the creation of such content creation even within the past for some of it. <br>- Either way I went back to bed upon low energy and this strange sort of facilitation and insinuation on my end upon waking up in which I dislike greatly. Certain kinds trying to label and trying to create certain actions happening behind the scenes in certain way. Some of this might have partly been to scare certain spirits in a way but also other events taking place upon creating another Soothsaying for September 19th, 2019. Certain battle and traps happening on either sides of certain spectrum in which I am witnessing spiritually. What exactly these battles are taking place from partly might have to do with past battles that were happening or potentially other kinds of events that we need to deal with but to be true I really feel it stems from the kinds of insinuations of attack within the past couple days and potentially more so in which some of the spirit have lemtented upon.<br>- I started raising my vibration upon certain kinds of events taking place in which saw certain kind comment in regards to wanting me to be below in certain thresholds anymore. As we can see the amount of resources being put into certain endeavors and vibration changing in regards to some trying change certain vibration for the negative and not necessarily to facilitate good health even through some of my folly, I think the same could be said that there are those able and willing to change the vibration for reasonings.<br>- There is this strange sort of feeling that some of have taken a step back from due to extraneous circumstances, some in which was a certain kind of labeling which seems has something to do with yesterday. I am uncertain why there is this back and fourth in regards to myself and others pertaining to being good or bad. It&#39;s understood and known what it is so I think maybe some are trying to stay kosher in certain places rather than truly trying to let know what it is in a certain context. It&#39;s strange that I would feel that both these groups or at least portion and not to be mistaken upon what some spirits are trying to label but rather two specific groups look as if though both at times are fighting in regards to myself in certain direction that doesn&#39;t much seem that either care about me. There are those though in which do regardless of certain circumstance labeling and direction in which has to label it a certain kinds to supposedly facilitate some.<br><br><br>Themes: <br>#Childhood #Dinosaurs #Dreams #Sask #Fights #Spiritual #Battle #Traps #Psychological #Threats #Sleeping #Awoken<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
