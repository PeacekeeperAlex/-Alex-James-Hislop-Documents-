<div class="title">(06/24/2019) &quot;The Conflicts to End to Finish the Fight Part 1&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- Head area flightiness in regards to writing more than two pages of my book, working on my website, I have noticed this as a certain kind of mentality feeling in which there was battle in regards, I could feel this mentality area or something similar to mentality in which presented turbulence and conflict as well as potentially a certain kind of electricity. This sort of moving of off certain things in regards to myself by way of feeling flighty was then said to have been potentially an energy issue as well as quality of life issue. I am not certain if this part of myself was mistreated or why this aspect fully feels this way but there is movements and interaction in regards to mentality spots in regards to myself in which is potentially linked to my past. It makes me wonder about the other physicals on this planet and what kind of quality of life they are receiving in regards to aspects that have shaped who they are. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for those aspects that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to myself and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) to be protected the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.  <br>- I felt certain Mentality move towards behaviour area and multiple conflict in regards to trying switch out certain components and qualities in regards to myself which might be related to certain locals of myself trying to be pushed out in regards to <br>- Multiple Conflict talked about in early morning wake up, from the inner conflict of those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to Care, Compassion, Kindness Crowds that my Main Camp indicated to the Conflict between certain Care, Compassion, Kindness Authorities that my Main Camp indicated and certain Banner and Dimension Authorities that my Main Camp indicated. <br>- There are some that are trying to heighten this process in certain extreme ways in which upon utilizing my Main Spirit Guides information in regards to this marking, advocations, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) could be safe in regards to certain event streamlining and things of that nature but their are those that ignoring that as well as unable to reach my Main Spirit Guides information. Transportation and Communication as well as knowledge in regards to certain situations are potentially needed but if we are kept in the dark how are we supposed to know which routes to take especially if quality of life down here in certain areas continues to be not of Fairness. Not even being able to speak of higher light and different kinds in regards to direction and guidance especially within the privacy of our own homes tells that there is a problem. Again there are events taking place that has more to do with something happening and routes taken rather than the utilization of conversation and even certain communication. To blame Events though might not necessarily be the route either. Something has to give. <br>- Another thing I have noticed is the invoking of a certain kinds of conflict between what is seemingly Concept and that of peoples. I can&#39;t think of less of a thing than to pit the people against the Concept and to have it done in such a way in which is currently invoked at times even if it pot shot warnings makes me feel that it is being monitored and if so being monitored then at what point is there intervention, granted there is a lto of different kinds of monitoring to a certain extent but the questions still remain as to when intervention from higher spiritual power becomes viable.<br>- The continued movement in regards to working against myself in the future and moving off of different preset in regards to present has somewhat so said stalled in regards to certain psychic communication by way of something in which happens in the future, some said it had to do with the creation of a place to be able to freely promote certain kinds of immorality in regards to the systems that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Also the continued attacks and stoppages in regards to attacks, the continued giving and taking away of decent life overlaps and opportunities as well as the utilization of immorality and morality to stack to <br>- There was other supers, spiritualists, etc.(defined by my Main Camp), those that my Main Camp indicated brought up yesterday in a certain degree which has shaped certain routes in which some have gone within my process as well as process interaction. <br>- Earlier in my process there was in a large way process rules, let knows, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in which was created and then shoehorned away from this process. It was sort of brought up again yesterday and I feel there is a feng shui Happening. There needs to be situating in regards to the informations that my Main Camp indicated.<br>- I found a group called the Revolutionary Spiritualism founded by Kyle Griffith. A Spiritualist that wrote a book that caught my eye on Coast to Coast AM. Heaven at War which prompted certain kinds of dimensional interaction. It lead towards a certain kind of vindication stance in regards to myself by spirits around myself in which I am not fully certain why, potentially a shift in regards to some of the Interaction.<br><br><br>Advocationals:<br>Ten Term Groupings in regards to the Authorities that my Main Camp indicated.
