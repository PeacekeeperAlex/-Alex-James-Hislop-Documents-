<div class="content">Activity: So it feels like I have been able to change certain anatomy and I have been utilizing that sort of thing here and there but I have also noticed that something has changed as well. Certain dimensional thresholds are continued to be affected in certain manners and regardless if this is hitting home or not and I feel that it is in a certain manners, those places that are able to affect the physical in certain ways in which I have felt changes be lamented upon within my process potentially to move of the subject in regards to the continued let knows in regards to certain targetings that have happened spiritually. There is multiple kinds of systems in which some of them have been decent in regards to the passing of physical but some of them haven&#39;t and either war even if it was somebody&#39;s time there has been still information that has been found out that it wasn&#39;t really that persons time in regards to certain cases but rather made somebody&#39;s time. That there were physicals assassinated in regards to certain events is evident and some personally on my end is disconcerting because of the kinds of stuff some of us have been through and how some of us are continuing to go through certain things in which the strength of other physicals and other-dimensionals would have aided us in regards to certain Life Path. How it correlates with our society and the lines of existences remains a partial mystery to myself but considering the kinds of peaceful and decent that we continue to do on this planet in comparison to the violence, especially when factoring the shitty circumstances we have been placed under not only physically but spiritually in which laments upon the potential difficulty in how one is suppose to do decent when some of the systems has been rigged to make us not fully succeed in being able to present certain parameters and variables which should allows to us to be a part of certain lines of existences. It just knock on the door of the shoddiness that has been apparent and the lack of Authority at times present while even having all of the Authority and Power to be able to do something about all the cruddy things hat have been happening but rather continue along which speaks words of something else at play, again that short of long game mend which tells of long healing in the psyche of those that potentially desire for this to continue in a certain manner. As well as an itinerary that continues to be brought up, like a technological schedule that is supposed to be followed to help us out in the future. Ones for our mentality and the systems that my Main Camp indicated that is judging where I am suppose to go in regards to me typing in my diary entries and other such places as well as those that judges where others that my Main Camp indicated should really scour the Internet to take a look at the amount of decent spiritualist websites and the fact that not many are talking about the kinds of things that I am talking about for a reason. It tells of something and that doesn&#39;t change the fact as to where I am going in the Afterlife and how much I am going to know because those two things are fairly set. I am going to go through my life and the things that happened. <br><br>Advocationals (This is a Starred One that my Main Camp indicated, if possible do it the way my Main Camp indicated, it&#39;s starred in that I feel it&#39;s quite important and potentially extends the defense portion, there is also a certain kind of stage potentially watching currently in regards to some):<br>Documentaries in regards to the good that some of the bad have done as well as those labelled bad. <br>Check-In and immorality industry monetary facilitation. <br>Immorality safeguards in ending up in situations afterlife where you are getting attacked.<br>Main Spirit Guides and Main Camp content experiences and different Main Spirit Guides and Main Camps exchanges. <br>Those that have recompense and compensation in which his suppose to be happening which is being ignored as well as help groups and holdings that can help with that sort of thing. <br>ripple affect of access in regards to when life utilization and life stealing is affected especially in regards to those holding down lives. <br>So the creation of level of life in multiple kinds of ways and moving upwards in regards to what my Main Camp indicated as well as safeguards and deterrents in regards to life stealing that my Main Camp indicated.<br>Things to keep busy in regards to waiting and staving.<br><br>Defense:<br>Life situating Life Saving, Life Stealing, those talking about violence to get people in a certain situation spiritually in regards to life utilization as well as being able to talk about violence without being shoehorned in some god forsaken place. <br><br>Far Away Light, the mentality of why should people care if we barely see them, hear from them or interact with them. <br><br>Reasonings as to why we shouldn&#39;t have to work against our family to hold it down anymore and why somebody should just protect us. <br>Why we should be able to promote and have access to the immorality that my Main Camp indicated and seemingly immorality that my Main Camp indicated. <br><br>Side with me, I am the good guy in a decent manner albeit not the decent manner that some were hoping for or as decent as some could be but to be quite honest do we want to be in another spot where we are getting attacked by way of choosing those content experiences where when we cross that line there is the potential of getting attacked and not to say that&#39;s fair either. This is the difficulty I have with it is that if I reside in a dimensional existences where that is the case and not to say that that&#39;s the truth of it but there is that sort of thing where am I suppose to accept that I deserve to be attacked? No. Where I can&#39;t reach out to Far Away Light and Far Away Dimensions? No. That would be why in regards to signing and consenting and looking at that sort of thing in regards to traversing a certain boundary as well as what that entailed on my end and others(defined by my Main Camp) especially when factoring that line being utilized in regards to entire overlaps and existence layering in regards to certain areas is needed to be understood and revisited, especially when some of those layerings and existences are potentially facilitating certain kinds of bigs and specials in a certain capacity. <br><br>This accords put into play to keep certain spirits and beings to still have access to this planet and others as well as research in regards to why that is , the benefits in regards to it and the reasonings and alternatives. <br><br>Those that got influenced and turned in the manners that my Main Camp indicated to go against the wishes of how they truly feel for real with consent. The information that my MAin Camp indicated and the opinions that can be asked in the moments that my Main Camp indicated can let know of the truth in regards to that sort of thing. <br><br>Key Knowledge in regards to these past paragraphs.<br><br>Those that would setup lengthy spots that haven&#39;t been attacked in regards to being able to promote the ways of life, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) that my Main Camp indicated without being, attacked etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in the way that my Main Camp indicated for length periods of time to trap and hamr certain spirits and being, saving in regards to that sort of things, facilitating compensation for those that create that sort of thing in the ways that my Main Camp indicated and research in understanding which ones are compromised in those ways and which ones aren&#39;t. Dispersing the information that my Main Camp indicated in regards to what my Main Camp indicated. <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) choose what my Main Camp indicated in regards to the existences that my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are choosing the existences that my Main Camp indicated in regards to being able to promote the ways of life, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in the ways that my Main Camp indicated without being, attacked, harmed, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are playing the cards that my Main Camp indicated in the moments that my Main Camp indicated especially in regards to the Amount of Times I have been stabbed in the Back Defensive Card to Defend behind our Backs, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
