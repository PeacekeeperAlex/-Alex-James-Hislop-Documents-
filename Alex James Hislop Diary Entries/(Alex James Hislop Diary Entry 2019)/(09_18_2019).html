<div class="title">(09/18/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- All day it&#39;s been an interesting and scary to note what I used to feel lower down in systems similar if not the same upon interaction specifically in regards to altering life path and affecting emery levels. One one hand I can feel certain kinds of conflict taking place below me and at times around me in which I feel is also there to provide smoke in mirrors in regards to some but in which is understood to be what it is in which is a lack of reasoning to attack myself and others. It might also be warfare but after the events of yesterday in which saw more kind vent but also attack in certain manners also provide a certain kind of cover supposedly to events the day before and the day before that. There was a moment where certain spirit made mistakes in multiple kinds of ways and the good spirit spinning it to advantage with the bad spirit doing their thing as well. What does it feel like to know and discern likeness pertaining to certain spiritual groups that have potentially cause oneself harm? Frightening is the answer. It&#39;s scary in multiple regards partially because I am also in communication at times with certain kind in which has had to sometimes cease for some of it was well not necessarily take place at all for some in which I might would have had contact with partially by way of some of the events taking place within my life and discerned to be taking place regardless as well. One of the interaction feng shui understandings yesterday is some trying to get me to be a certain kind in which I partially am agreeable with in which speaks of being chirpy and outspoken. It&#39;s the kinds of stuff that within the privacy of your home and communications set the way your main proxies indicated that wouldn&#39;t necessarily be as much of a problematic in regards to being outspoken but upon some of the issues and ways that I operate it being less of a problematic especially upon some of the interactions that have happened within my process. Some of the things witnessed to have been done to myself by spiritual interaction and other kinds have made it interestingly not necessarily what some think it to be and most certainly what others consider it to be. <br>- I have felt a more immediate kind of interaction lately upon getting back in the swing of things in which multiple kinds of energy devastation were felt below myself and because I could feel it in a certain way it didn&#39;t not seem as impactful as it once did but for some below me and located in certain areas it was certainly so. Another Spirit I discern to be changing has to do with targeting me in certain ways, like how some spirit have challenged this process but also in ways in which seem to be unfair like certain kind ask questions about why some spirit have attacked this process in such ways especially upon finding out some of the stuff that certain kind did. Partially having to do with a movement of energies in which said that somehow to attack this person in regards to other dimensional selves and spirit that didn&#39;t have anything to do with me  when it wasn&#39;t and has been proving to not be especially in regards to being innocent. <br>- Multiple things worked upon, finishing up certain documents like the (AJHD) Gem Theatre and the (AJHD) Gem Theatres as I have had experiences in regards to some of those theatres even spiritually upon discerning multiple kinds of spiritual intraction. Some of which having to do with spiritual banner interaction as well as the enticements of certain Spiritual Heroes and Villains. It&#39;s not unheard of to notice spiritual movement of Nations behind the scenes pertaining to certain kind of interaction in which can give a tell as to what is going on in certain dimensional existences. Strangely enough though the same could be said about certain kinds of energy discernment pertaining to powerful spirit and gods in which some could classify as Supers. Yes there is an understanding that some of the depiction that I am experiencing could be fictional and fantasy but some of the stimuli points towards a realism that speaks that some of the events depicted and the kinds of stuff that I would experience to be non-fiction. <br>- I also finished certain kinds of avocational in regards to sewers and Betting. There has been notice that this month during September on my end spiritually there has been thing about some of the sewers partially in regards to It Chapter 2. You may note that upon certain film releases the kinds of antic depending on the film can vary even in physical population. So you look towards like certain horror releases like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the dude in the drive in theatre that starts up the Chainsaw to scare moviegoers of the likes that my Mother would witness upon the release in the 70s during that release. The kind of theatrics and scare tactics from during certain horror releases makes sense but the kind of stuff they have in the spirit coupled with immorality cultural emergence understandings has made it so that the knowledge of certain releases and the hype machine regards would see multiple kinds of things happen. It&#39;s the kind of normality that would see this kind of stuff happen in certain areas setup as well as not so upon certain kind of events whether it be physical based or not so. <br><br>Dream: <br>There was a bit of an emphasis and an update in regards to certain spirits. There was a focus in regards to one of my family members and it looked to me in the dream like I was learning about him and understanding more about what he was about. There are certain dreams in which can seem fast paced, like a lot of dream happening within the frames of the dream and this was most certainly one of those fast paced highly packed dreams. <br><br>Advocationals:<br>Frameworks in regards to questions to the spirit project.<br>doing activities behind the scenes stuff and energy levels.<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.

I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for Historical Reputational Defense in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and the Historians that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Clickable links like the show all actions on the Peacekeeperalex trello account and attachments section where upon me clicking links shows up on my screen has been at times shoehorned into a spot where some in the spirit think that it needs to be shown in order for it to work. If I never traverse to Google.ca that doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist in the public especially the spiritually that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The data upon clicking some of those links on the peacekeeperalex trello account and the Alex James Hislop Documents on Github are public regardless of whether I click them or not, they have public links in which exist online especially in regards to the Spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.

Another example is : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeacekeeperAlex/-Alex-James-Hislop-Documents-/master/(AJHD)%20AJH%20Monetary%20Creation.txt , You don&#39;t need to sign in to see any of the physical information there, you can open it in a incognito window and it will display. https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5b3546fd00481cc3f86f5b01/5c95f6df01642a7b47cefd84/5351fa2f4c120894fde5b952dd8601f2/(AJHD)_Google.txt I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for this paragraph to be placed where my Main Spirit Guides indicated daily the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. </div>
