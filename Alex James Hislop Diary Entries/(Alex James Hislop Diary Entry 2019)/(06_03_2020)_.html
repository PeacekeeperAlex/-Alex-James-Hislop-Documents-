<div class="title">(06/03/2020) </div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Take note of the energies you feel in life for they could very well be linked with past selves, past spiritual events and even ways of life from yourself that exist. Sometimes you can feel atmospherics that can point towards different times within your life certain interaction frameworks come around you. Impressional especially but also emotion, mental, intuition, thought and chakras even in other extra sensory sot of ways. It comes in many forms like dreams and visions, psychic flashes and discernment of stimuli other worldly in which there is sometimes a name already created to the purpose that is already known or understood in a baseline manner as to the wordings and interaction communicational environmental held by knowledge and experience as well as memory and upon the fact that there is such lens and inflection within our languages and understanding that has been there pointing towards the fact of what spirituality is telling you are the keys. Like Astral planes having an air and muted feeling along with outlining physical and overlapping, ominously described at times which tells of naming infrastructure in regards to different places through our wordings. Different connotations used like light astral planes and the comparison which again there is ones like the ones see within Outer Body Experience Research but also ones seen within Near Death Experience Research which tells of different surfaces of life. Overlapping bodies and selves within incarnation and different kinds of other dimensional worlds at times in association and there are ones in the light overlapping at times and much of this is good and moral, there is a large percentage that is enlightened and do keep spiritual safe. When you note in your interaction happens to be spiritual in nature. Light a candle and what does it do to the energies. Start a bonfire and compare to a walk in the woods. Play a video game and then go out driving and discern the spiritual around onseelf. The smells and sense that you obtain when you open the window or when you walk down the street can be discerned and it goes on beyond far that when you get those the kind of dimensional interaction taking place with potentially thousands and millions if not larger percentages of populations involved within a process interaction. Ripple effect upon actions and what takes place upon your existence impact to the world around oneself. I had memories again today of dreams, especially the ones with the comfortable, red and sometimes single seater and the gravity of spiritual around my younger toys have seemed larger than life. Talks of different markers that exist where time changed. Life changed. Became different and I am with in interaction with many of them at times. Items hold power and the tells of time moving on? Or is it a time for intervention? Is there spiritual events taking place to make us happier and brighter, more enlightened and willing to life live more than most. When does it start to change, you feel more groggy the one day and the next have a lot more energy, what are your energy levels regarding your activities is probably one of the most important questions you can ask yourselves. If it really is spiritual in nature upon those energies and there is spiritual in interaction within your process, what does that mean? Imagine one of your best friends in the world in the most beautiful form in the world is hovering around you seeing you as you wanted to be seen and the kinds of interactions upon that spiritual existing and how you can actually speak towards them those who are your camp and let them know that you are, you express it and let them know, they see you respond and can interact with you spiritually and sometimes try to interact with your live dimensional. Loving. It&#39;s one of the keys pointed towards in which can bring fourth spiritual of that mindset and demeanor just by loving. <br><br>Mode 1: I want you to try and visualize a white orb in your chest area. Envision this orb enveloping the area where your heart is and envision white light pulsing out of it. Just as you can use white light manifestations to defend yourself you can also use it to invoke a loving response. I advise using Heart Radiance in a meditative state during first attempts. If you are having difficulty with the above visualization, you can try envisioning white light radiating like a stream advancing from your heart outwards in a forward fashion rather. I initially used this alternate method with success.<br>Mode 2: There is an emotional center at the core of the emotional body which I believe usually overlaps the physical body. This emotional center is often located near the heart chakra and is not only where you can feel emotions but also where you can create them. After a while of picturing pulsating white light, I want you to try and emanate love from your Emotional Center. The visualizations are there to lead towards a loving response, but the envisioning alone is not what creates the emotion. A willful projection of that emotion may be needed in order to actually be creating that emotion.<br>Mode 3: The emotions that you feel in your emotional center is sometimes not your own. It is my understanding that spirits sometimes implant their own emotions within our own emotional core to elicit an emotional response. So emotions that you feel without you willfully producing them may not be yours which is not to say that there are times when we present emotional responses in which can feel involuntary. Learning to control your emotions may be a part of this but I also feel the influencing of your emotions might be a part of this as well. Keep this in mind as you continue to learn how to create love out of your emotional center. Practice until you are able to generate a loving feeling from your emotional core. You are looking for a warm fuzzy kind of feeling in your heart area. The emotion of love is what you are trying to achieve from this technique. If you have somebody you truly love in your life, not just the word or the idea, then use that to your advantage. Radiate towards that person in conjunction with the HCR methods. Emulate the Love you feel towards that person and harness that into daily emotional output. It can be a warm fuzzy kind of emotion. Think of all the positive emotions that you have experienced in your life and try and pinpoint if you have felt love before. Through continued use, you will get to a point where you can radiate love at will without having to visualize or be in a meditative state. I am advocating for safety in regards to loving when you are driving or doing something in which needs concentration.<br>Mode 4: Once the ability to feel the love develops and you start to understand how to invoke love more clearly, you can start to radiate different types of love. Compassion the emotion of loving care, Loving Happiness is sort of a joyous warmth, Humility being a type of selfless love, Inspiration being a motivational sort of Love, Sensual can be a pleasurable kind of love.<br>Mode 5: So we have been focusing more on the emotional core within the past four modes but I now want you to try and focus on your emotional body. So think of an egg as a metaphor in regards to the emotional body/core. The core is the yoke in which is usually located near your heart and is where you predominantly feel the emotion and create emotion. The body is like the egg white, usually overlapping your entire physical body, in which can be difficult to feel. You don’t usually feel an emotion in your head or hands even though there is an emotional body overlapping the physical. Comparing the difference in what you feel emotionally between the core and body can vary. Keep in mind that I did not always know the emotional body existed because I could not feel it clearly at first. I started to be able to feel the difference between the emotional body and core once I was able to differentiate between the core and body. Loving from your emotional body can feel muted compared to loving from your core at times. This emotional body is difficult to feel at first but the same methods you used to achieve love within your emotional centre can be applied to your emotional body. Using the first four modes in the context of radiating love from the entire emotional body. Being able to love out of your hand or head area rather than just your chest/heart area. Keep practicing and I feel that you will be able to feel it and differentiate soon enough. This mode is to be attempted once you have a better understanding of what Heart Radiance is about. If you are still new to HR and are currently still working on the first four modes, don’t be dissuaded if you are still having difficulty understanding.<br><br>The ability to love is attainable in many different ways and even quick searches online can get you in the right direction but these methods work and I learned from them in being able to understand the ability of love more clearly. You want to be able to create the loving radiance at will through utilization of emotional mechanisms in chest area, imagine trying to recreate fake laughter or trying to get angry when you don&#39;t like it, try to create emotion form the heart center at will. What do you discern. What do you discern when you feel emotion throughout the day and what was your last emotional encounter. What did it fee like? The loving emotion your looking for in emulation after you pinpoint how to create emotions and follow the methods up above if needed. Loving radiance out of the heart area can feel like a light emotion but you can also do it through turbulent energies in literal, like windy energies. Pursuing intimacy will give you an idea of the kinds of energies that exist and what you feel during should be noted during in what you feel in your chest area and the tell that you might be in direct contact with spiritual during is a high possibility.

In pursuing such acts you don&#39;t need to feel uncomfortable but rather aware if possible and alert in discerning your energies during  such experiences.</div>
