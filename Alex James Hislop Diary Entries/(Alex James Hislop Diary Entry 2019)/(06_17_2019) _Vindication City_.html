<div class="title">(06/17/2019) &quot;Vindication City&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>- A complete implosion happened yesterday night upon trying to go to bed in regards to certain groups. For the past two days after the AJH Daily Defensive video certain Authorities tried ity a certain way. Spirits backed off of the channel for a bit and I went silent for a while. <br>- The let know there are those that are surviving based off of my typing, a larger percentage based off of certain handlers providing resources upon me typing and speaking with my physical out loud voice in which also at times has been utilized, at least in regards to the physical out loud voice to harm certain spirits behind the scenes. <br>- This has extended at times in regards to some implanting certain information in regards to my typed word as well as others in fashions. Of course in the mix of it all are those that don&#39;t want me to type because it actually does help and the information listed at times in both typed and written word as well as behind the scenes information to be quite decent partially from a spiritual historical perspective but also in regards to information let knows.<br>-  Letting know of this potentially corresponds with a stealing of information in which was said to have happened earlier in which it might be a mixed bag of decent and indecent by way of the checks currently happening. Forces of Morality and other kind of banners checking on things today partially by way of some of the events that happened early morning and late at night yesterday. <br>- Multiple regular run of the mill actions yesterday I did at times in which was supposedly garnering certain kinds of response. Eating Sandwiches playing video games and watching content as well as pursuing intimacy in regards to June 16th, 2019 in which certain events happened in which I feel unacceptable to be the cause of some of spiritual events in which potentially happened especially if my information is not a decent enough reason to attack me at this point in time. The way the information is worded is sound and the there is multiple kinds of safeties in regards to the way the physical digital information is worded, let alone the spiritual information. <br>- I watched Wreck It Ralph and the storylines in regards reminded me of aspects of myself and Jamie Hart as well as darker aspects of ourselves in certain manners. The ensuing in which happened by way of the storylines that had happened were cray cray at least on my end. It was also potentially linked with a certain kind of memory in which I want to be safeguarded in a certain manner. There were also moments where I felt upset upon not necessarily being a certain kind in which can just whip it out. There was something said to have happen that needed blossom on this page in regards to this storyline and I ant defense in regards to multiple people in regards to listing this if possible I didn&#39;t know if I was supposed to let know or not but since I and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated have been going the way of honesty to a decent degree.<br>-  The kinds of actions i was doing and less aggressive via channel work and talking didn&#39;t give much of a reason even without reason while doing that anyhow which there might be need for differnetk inds of hookups and outlets. Things here and there to heighten certain interaction as well as the consequences in regards to those actions in which knock at the door of not living a quality of life in certain dimensional existences in which does extent to the physical by way of what some of us experience in those dimensional existences. Just because of certain physical perspective don&#39;t realize that they lived thousands of years in certain moments in regards to other dimensional existence which is reflected in certain memory thresholds and potentially physical memory doesn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t experience those things for what&#39;s acceptable. For those experience the negative, harm, hurt and suffering it can be impactful.<br>- Intimacy pursuit again I have experience turbulence in regards in which ahs knocked at the door of similarities of smoking weed which at times has been turbulent that talks of living good life being unacceptable albeit different. I discerned targetings at times although a specific kind in regards to intimacy experiences. <br>- - Playing video games ahs been something different where a certain kinds of interaction takes place and I have discerned a certain kind of battle and warfare as well as the utilization of violent videos games to created access in regards to dakr kinds in which then sometimes reside in processes of certain people who play those violent video games. Some of the battle discernment is in regards to content experiences and existences where that sort of thing is clouth though. <br>- The resources in regards to certain pursuits in regards to working against myself has been at times way too much that it should be and I can&#39;t really blame certain anti-camps at times in regards to some of it especially given the circumstances that some of them have gone through and what exactly is on the table. <br>- Today felt like a mediation and legal kind of review day in which certain groups and individuals of power in a certain manner were around. Trips to the city also lent towards this kind of interaction in a certain manner but there is also that sort of thing around me at times in which is enforced by accords and other kinds in which speaks of certain spirits and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that can traverse past certain kinds of migration boundaries in regards to certain kind. Multiple migration paths all the while continuing in regards to certain overlap and dimensional existences. <br><br>Advocationals:<br>Those leaders that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this marking, advocations, etc.(defined by my main Camp) in which have been trying to do good, moral and decent the way my Mian Spirit Guides indicated. <br>Ring a ding dingers that my Main Spirit Guides indicated on June 14th, 2019<br>June 14th, 2019<br>June 11th, 2019 <br>Immorality top 100 advocations that I and others(defined by my mian Camp) could do<br>Morality top 1000 advocations that I and others(defined by my Main Camp) <br>Ammorality top 10 advocations that I and others(defined by my Main Camp)<br>Vindication City<br>(AJHD) Burn Area especially in regards to Content Experience Access<br>Events that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to June 17th, especially in regards to Afterlife.<br>Situating in regards to the Medicine and Drugs that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>Only believing those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated being good instead of basing specifically when brought up in channel and communications in regards to someone or channeling through.<br><br>Ideas:<br>Future Self Letter to my Present Self<br>Present Self Letter to my Past Self<br>Past Self Letter to my present self <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
