<div class="title">(02/13/2019) &quot;What Now&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Key Points spirits and others don&#39;t need to harm me and others:<br>- What has been done to me and what I have done in the physical. <br>- What I feel is decent enough allocation of things to be able to promote in regards to immorality and other concepts alongside in the way my Main Camp indicated. <br>- The reasons you don&#39;t want me to die.<br>- The reasons you don&#39;t have to kill me.<br>- The repercussions of my death. <br>- Harming myself, a let know. <br>- Being truly careful for what&#39;s acceptable in regards to Informational embedment in regards to Alex James Hislop, the bigger demon^<br>- Evil and Darkness, Brimstone, Anger and Hate as well as disrespect are not to blame. I left anger Management for a reason and I feel it helped, it was a creation from the No More Arguments section of my Defense board, a play on words in regards to me fight and arguing, as much as  I Like and care about arguing, I don&#39;t want to do that anymore, quite honest I have been attacked at times and there needs to be some leeways for arguing, and the one that really needed to be listed was no more disrespect in regards to alex james hislop promoting certain kinds of disrespect, it&#39;s not meant as a literal but more of a mindset. Again, it&#39;s lees to do with certain concepts as to why I am attacked and more to do with upsetness of things going away? Upsetness <br><br>Psychic Information: <br>A group that needs the leeway in being able to research most everything especially in regards to what they get if they do research most everything. I felt how I felt, I even said to certain beings that I feel it might be beneficial in regards to stopping the research in regards to certain things to save time, if I ever to a place where I am able to speak to you, I will try to forwards truth, If it is tethered to certain things, I can only do so much, I am sorry. More time seems to be a key factors, potentially being able to promote a certain kind of immorality for longer periods of time, there might be something to do that in regards to when researching for seemingly everything for answers that there is an allotment of immorality allowances, some of which looked upon in a certain way less than some and more than others and it might not be a place to stack up either, meaning that maybe only certain spirits are allowed into that sort of thing. Yesterday, something happened and the live perspective bounced back again and potentially as here the entire time that focus and clarity was around again. There was this idea yesterday about spirit and being getting targeted and attacked, targeted was under the gun yesterday in a certain kind of way. Three things that are actually a part of the fourth, One - My Main Spirit Guides, Main Camp, Main Xant and Main Guides information getting through where my Main Spirit Guides indicated matters greatly, Two - myself and others(defined by my Main Camp) being dimensionally set which includes what my Main Camp indicated is greatly important the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated, Three - Alex James Hislop and others(defined by my Main Camp) Communications that my Main Camp indicated not being set the way my Main Camp indicated is a difficulty at times that needs to be resolved the way my Main Camp indicated. All three have disclaimers in various places some of which in my physical live existence in 42 Franklin Beach Road, those three things have been protected and defined quite heavily and to be true through it all, there is still problematics at times but it&#39;s one of those things that will matter greatly in the end and I am not certain no amount of patsies gonna do justice. Energies changing in regards to certain processes being able to feel good, I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for a feng shui of those energies and a sharing of resources the way my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for content experience defense by way of vent and offense responses being able to be done in regards to existences and content experiences as well as with industry and economic support the way my Main Camp indicated. Spirits and brings trying to feng shui certain situationals in my direction, putting blame and trying to invoke apocalyptics and something terribly gone wrong on my walk, something seriously not right in regards to some of seemingly normalities out there, peoples are watching and paying attention, i said a lot of different let knows on the walk coupled with a large amount of verbal advocationals, some of which in regards to valentines day, inforia. I AM BARELY DOING ANYTHING!!!!! DAILY ADVOCATIONS!??!?!?!? WHAT!?!?!? SO WHAT!?!?! IT&quot;S NOT WORTH THE AMOUNT OF SEEMINGLY HORRIBLE THINGS SAID TO HAVE BEEN DONE TO ME IS IT?!? FINE, I DO ADVOCATIONS BUT IT&#39;S NOT UNHEARD OF AND ITS DONE THE WAY MY MAIN CAMP INDICATED. THE AMOUNT OF HEIGHTENED GARNERED AGAIN RIGHT AFTER YESTERDAY&#39;S SEEMINGLY DEHEIGHTEND PROCESS AND LET KNOW ADVOCATIONAL REPUTATIONAL DEFEND CAUGHT ON VIDEO<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhPUU1z5GtI MAKES NO DAMN SENSE! THIS WAS IN THE EARLY MORNING! The process gets heightened again and the bigger issue I suppose isn&#39;t heightening but being able to be heightened as well as smalls having access to heightened processes and vice versa. While I do like the live and certain heightened there&#39;s this thing which says we cant be that anymore and it&#39;s been saying that for a while now which has a bit to do with getting attacked. It&#39;s been cleared to a certain extent that I don&#39;t deserve to be harmed especially not to the degree insinuated at times regardless of how much believe and faith I have in regards to not being attacked. I am sorry. I just don&#39;t think it to be in regards to certain things and maybe I am wrong and it scares the shit of me in regards to certain things. one the things I felt happen was a feng shui in regards to certain comedians and tells in regards to certain groups of peoples like those in regards to those who don&#39;t want to be a part of certain events and conversations. There was tells about people combining into bigger beings as well as apocalyptic events especially as well as events pertaining to earth in regards to earth and other the way my Main Camp indicated. TIme and communications are talked about this day and things really did sort of take off a bit, I am guessing communication were also still a theme later on and potentially time. I watched outlaw king, the whole score is amazing and the cinematography was amazing . All of the actors really did an amazing job. Some of the spiritual themes I pick up was certain kinds of conflict lower dower and there was this down in the mud kind of approach from the lead. Grim and sad moments in the film and certain kinds of things happening at times in regards to the filming of this content. <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. Light; Do what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to these advocations the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and Others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) consider the Light to be what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) consider Far Away Light to be the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light.
