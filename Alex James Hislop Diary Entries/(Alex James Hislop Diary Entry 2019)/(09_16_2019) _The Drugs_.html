<div class="title">(09/16/2019) &quot;The Drugs&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- The idea of this long game mend for some the utilization in regards to it and the idea that there are those that were captured, stolen and for some that just want out of certain areas. Some in which are experiencing demeaning and work loads in which upon some of them hold a grudge so subtle and blaze upon the giving up and depression in regards to those that could have saved. There are those worse off too in which are experiencing pain and suffering to only imagine what kind of grudge they hold. This idea that there are some that would utilize this to be the next conflict after a certain portion of the long game. In which to utilize these kind of spirit to create the next conflict. Some looked at it from the perspective that some of the bad good guys would utilize this against. Interestingly enough that it was bad good guys that never saved upon continue the route that they did in which would try try utilize those in which feel a certain way. <br>- Multiple kinds of interaction happening upon which I don&#39;t discern too much conflict but I feel that there is some taking place in which again is potentially trying to be utilized in regards to those that are just living there life in which don&#39;t necessarily discern certain conflict but also the let know regarding that there is potentially spiritually conflict taking place in regards to some of us or rather something else and said to be because of some of us even in a soft core sort of blame. Interaction in which I have discerned some looking away and not trying to interact with me in a certain manner. Certain good guys came around and there was also a forming up but this time it supposedly wasn&#39;t the bad guys hanging around in the interaction holding things skeleton crew style. I am wondering if this has been utilized in a way to potentially say they won certain conflict. <br>- I have felt other dimensional stimuli, first a movement while I was recording the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Content (09/16/2019) in which I felt taking of certain kinds of eye energies and things of that nature. The channel was also put under certain kind of stress and tiredness on the Channel Infrastructure in which afterward I got the impression of certain kind ignoring this process. There also a pulling of circulation upon my feet areas in which for once I felt like I was able to fee more circulation in my feet and there was a padding sink kind of feeling in my stance upon the taking a shower. Again more channeling in the throat area being moved to thought channeling, it started hardening up or what was discerned as that stimuli. I can feel channel infrastructure in regards to the throat area and moments where it seems and feels easier to talk in which was moved to thought area upwards.There was also a a movement in my head in which felt like more health in regards to my hair area, a certain kind of aspect to my hair put fourth on my head area in which I never fully discerned that there was an aspect that should have been placed there. I surmise that there are aspects of ourselves that if we could fully note the changes in regards to our anatomy we would have certain questions spiritually as to why certain aspects were moved in other areas lending towards certain kinds of stimuli in regards to our selves existing and also not so whether it be seemingly or not. One of the thing I noted was light in the head area forehead in which I discerned an other dimensional crack in which was shining light. The eyes felt more responsive form some of the changes in regards to myself and my memory more keen. There was also a cracking of being where I felt cracks and awareness and realization in regards to certain kind of inner self awoken. I also felt an amount of certain kinds of dimensional drugs which has reminded of OxyContin in my system. I have felt stimuli regarding this last one here and there even though I am not taking any such drugs but in a another dimensional sort of way. This time it was really heightened and I could feel it almost as if I had taken the drug in which I have felt certain spiritual in regards to different stimuli such a different tastes behind the scenes upon certain food, like scrambled eggs within certain espresso in which is one of the best things to grace the art of coffee. Spiritual and other-dimensional lending towards the food we eat, like when we eat a banana someone changes the flavor behind the scenes to grapefruit but there is also different kinds in which might not be so quick as a flip of a button or a setting but rather ingredients dimensionally added to food as well. This also has applied to certain vitamins I have taken. There have been times when I have taken waited and been able to feel other dimensionally and this at times has applied to certain kind of drugs affect too upon certain kind of action. Alcoholic beverages being affected and the buzz regarding being influenced and manipulated by spirit around myself. Another one having to do with Marijuana intake in the high being influenced as well. I am wondering if this is similar in regards to the Oxycontin affect and opiate feelings I have felt at times upon drinking in which I feel is on my side of things.<br><br>Advocationals:<br>Spiritual Newspapers<br>Channeling attacked and channeling seizures<br>Anti-Camp Blamed that are innocent <br>Anti-Camp Mislabellment in which was actually good spirit captured put in patsy positions. <br>Those that are getting out of certain areas.<br>Privacy<br>Those that have been awoken and given knowledge and/or found as well as other kinds in regards to going new routes. The kind in which you see recovered, potentially remembrance and other kinds in which can spark new direction. Those that were influenced and manipulated in regards to certain direction, like working against family members for years or lead to be attracted to something in which they were not attracted towards. The kind of stuff where some were lead astray to harm and hurt upon certain kinds of import. <br>Reputational Defense<br>Main Spirit Guides<br>Alternatives to utilize defensives in regards to Alex James Hislop&#39;s process.<br>Interaction<br>Connection<br>Health and preparation<br>Walking<br>Drug Addicts<br><br>Themes:<br>#Drugs #Interaction #MedicalObservation #Spiritual #SpiritWorld #SpiritRealm #Psychic #SpiritualistCommunities #Change #ProcessDirection #LifePath #LifePathUtilization #GodSparkSafeguarding #Safeguarding #Walking #Connection #Health #Preparation #Gaming #Revelation #Meetings #Updates #Knowledge #Impact #RippleEffect #ContentCreation #ReadingIT #AlexJamesHislopDiaryEntryContent #Tags #LegalStarred #NonLegalStarred <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
