<div class="title">(05/08/2019) &quot;So where does that leave us?&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>So I woke up today and it seems like it&#39;s one of those situations where the landscape in certain areas changed and there is different kinds of tuff holding it down in regards to immorality but still a disconcerting in regards to certain things. Instead of erraticness I feel there is a carry on mentality in regards to those trying to figure out certain situations. The utilization of certain cultures and things of that nature in which exists has been understood in certain manner but I feel that it doesn&#39;t tuck under the rug the battle and war that is still taking place. Within the mix of the existences and overlaps that my Main Camp indicated there is a war taking place that can and has impacted certain dimensional existences. The labelling of whistle blowing continues except that that&#39;s not it, it&#39;s normalcy good sir to defend oneself in the manners that my Main Camp indicated. Corruption continues in the manners that my Main Camp indicated and can continue in the Manners that my Main Camp indicated in which the transfer overs and the existence creation as well as the access that my Main Camp indicated can facilitate. Then it moves to the lines of areas that my Main Camp indicated and jurisdiction in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated and others(defined by my Main Camp) The overblowing of events to cover what went down on this day and others is going to be sorted with the amount of eyes and camera that have been seeing the places that my Main Camp indicated and the worst part about it is that those that would do harm in regards to certain people fall into the trap set. There are those that want you to attack and some look at it from both sides. This is the thing of it. <br><br>A bunch of stuff happened, they switched certain kind of interacting frameworks that angry prompting kind which was a part of some of the interaction in regards to 2017 and 2018 maybe even 2016 at times. Utilization of that sort of framework in the middle of a bucn how different tactics.  Lumping a lot of different moments and stuff to cover a bunch of different things but the decent are the let knows of that kind of things. Then there were moments of let knows that someone was getting attacked and harmed in ca very real way there was let knos of not playing this right now that that was there stuff but it might be trying to have something have happen or a warning let know in regards to certain things. There was also this moment of stealing in regards to myself too in which was said to situate a certain areas, I was dragged off somewhere other dimensionally and continuing to move upwards at an alarming pace. A feng shuing of my process in which I dislike in the manners that my Main Camp indicated as well as ignoring some key points that are happening today in multiple kinds of ways, the idea to look at multiple things arisses to a certain extent which kind reminds of those that go through everything a bit, maybe a different kind. Cultures clashing in regards to streamlining certain things by way of different kinds of metamorphosis<br><br>Defense:<br>One of the big ones this month is in getting myself to go after different groups to get those groups to work together against myself and to label me some sort of vagrant and disturbed of all things. <br><br>Three kind of big changes partially to defend and partially to tuck under the Rug, one was the reveal at the end of March 2019 during some gaming when I was playing Rome 2 Total War, something to do with a certain energy and things of that nature saying that there was certain existences that were of gaming nature and that peoples were not attacked as much as thought. On my end they pointed towards two things, one of which happened to do with an older house of Doug and Sherry Hislop specifically certain rooms and memories but I couldn&#39;t perceive anything wrong and just because Light is perceived I don&#39;t know that that points towards total safety, if it does then that&#39;s the decent of it but the amount of lies told at times and my own stimuli tells that attack and harm have happened, the revela that there are potentially group utilizing certain technology to help and potentially cover up certain things in capacities in which is potentially not help becomes apparent. The other one notice on the first happened to do with Jolene and Jessica&#39;s as well as others(defined by my Main Camp) Cottage that was near Mario LaRocca&#39;s old cottage, my grandfather&#39;s Cottage on Trent River. Again thought I perceived memory influences like someone placed an energy in my memory in which was based off of an impression that I would feel around the capras at times specifically the last Name<br><br>Early may has been this facilitation of certain kinds of bigger points in regards to certain things, one of which happens to do with getting attacked and the acceptance in regards to it albeit in a subtle different kinds of way, like there are things like that posed under the guise of certain systems in which might not even be the true culprit but rather stolen items in regards to some. It&#39;s a baseline but not the only things, key energy placements as well in regards to certain things and based off of certain events  and reactions in which some of it makes no sense but potentially becomes cleared upon the bigger picture. These events taking place and the harnessing of the things in which are happening, especially in regards to the specials needs to be seen with the scrutiny of Justice and Fairness. It kind of felt like a certain authority was situating for something in which kind of made certain sense upon what would happen on the 7th of May and the 8th of May. <br><br>The second big one that I discerned in regards to certain maneuvers some of which is to save certain peoples Banner stuff on May 7th, 2019, there was a large interaction in regards to a framework and showing up of certain kind in which even some of the outside world in regards earth were bit hesitant, it lets know that there was disturbances upon certain peoples showing up in certain dimensional existences some of which happened to do with movers and shakers of physical ailments and cures, a certain realms that I have discerned be able to affect physical in a certain way in which has been sort of labelled at times to be a certain, the kind of culture let know in regards to it has been varied but also not so and the focus at one point time was about chit systems, something would be created like a ticket and there would be certain dimensions going to work on it. Some of it has to do with being in certain moments upon passing on in which is real stuff but there was also that idea of the facilitating certain kinds of events in the spiritual to have that have said as well as the information in regards to the targetings regarding physicals in which affected certain events that were going to unfold in regards to the defense of certain peoples. Anyhow, for some there are big changes happening and I hope it&#39;s the kind that see the prosperity that some were looking for in the manners that my Main Camp indicated. There was revealed at the end of the night that I might have been one of those that got attacked as well as potentially attacked but I am not sure which, I could feel memories of bad times, being stuck in places where I was scared and praying for certain things to be over. Again memory influences can be manipulated but it only goes so far for what&#39;s acceptable. It&#39;s why putting the (AJHD) Truth information into play yesterday I feel to be a decent move and with the perception of time changing to such a degree in regards to certain peripherals, I gauged that amount of time passed when I placed those warhammer items on earth which might not have had anything to do with it for what&#39;s acceptable. <br><br>The third one I discerned happened today but in the capacities I don&#39;t fully know not as it had to do with morel et knows about some not being attacked as much as perceived.
