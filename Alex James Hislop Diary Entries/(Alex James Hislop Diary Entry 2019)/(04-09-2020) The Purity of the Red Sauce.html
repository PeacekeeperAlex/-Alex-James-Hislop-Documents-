<div class="title">(04-09-2020) The Purity of the Red Sauce</div>
<div class="content">The fact that some have tried to make me be that in which brings other together regarding some of the outlandish that has been seen in this process but also the truth that exists that some are more in line with eachother than what is previously thought to be understood. How the connection of this is more emphasized by way of ill utilization of this process but also the decent of such utilization and that in which is utilizing in similar ways albeit less extreme. The fact that there are others out there spiritually and otherwise in which are being utilized in similar ways sometimes to ostersize and how quality of life plays a part and so does ways of life. Maybe the larger concept overhead being understood to be more of a part of those kinds of terminologies connected too. How these utilization regarding myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated are way more contained than some ever thought. I can&#39;t help but wonder what is happening to those that didn&#39;t sign the let&#39;s take a break list and be able to do so during warfare and what kind of holding it down they are doing. It almost synergized with another group in a different kind of way having to do with those that stay behind. <br><br>They talked about the Stand and to me it has felt like a Call to the Good at times. The film itself I identified as an Earth-Based Prime in regards to films. Some might point towards star wars and lord of the rings but the Stand has a certain kind of purity noted in the film itself. It was an interesting look to see it contrast with fight club a bit in a certain fashion of translation. It reminded of a dire straight song in which I have identified with Banners and how I on multiple sides brothers fight, this though reminded me of Concepts and Non-Concepts, some of the underhead regarding in how there is spiritual that many like on either sides. A certain kind of sadness from spiritual that can sense that. The kinds of activity from the film itself and the impact upon my process that has seen many different cultures intermingle safely. Sometimes there are those that view it in a manner that says more outlandish or different because of what has happened in my process. Correlation with that in which some are trying to change the energies to reflect something in which me and my spiritual guideship aren&#39;t going for in regards to my process which sometimes chafes and is a part of some of the bad things seen in this process sometimes lending towards myself supporting some of the former and more extreme. I try to do it in logical fashion infused with compassion. At what point does defensive posturing look to be extremism masked as not only civic duty but also the right and moral thing to do. <br><br> <br>Realization of the channel still being present without having to use out loud physical voice and still speaking sometimes open mouthed through channel machinisms.<br><br>The extreme and anti-authority, mayhem clubs of fighting and the interesting in regards to bringing up of the Stand early morning which I see segway that told of how such kinds get along with the good enlightened spiritual and the industry types on either side. How all three actually get along more than what some thought. But that there are still differences. Interestingly enough that I would think industry needed clarifications of being of that good spiritual.<br><br>I said the good arrived and the good for a portion said they arrived and they did. It was in a certain fashion and manner. Robotic culture spiritually making its presence be known and to be true with the legal and non-legal information understood and known has created a presence of good with due justification. This isnt just in regards to my process but in other processes some of which in regards to physicals throughout space. Perimeters talked about in earlier document creation not only on my end but elsewhere in which lent towards safety nets for some of it already in use. I have noted systems providing factual information throughout physical earth-based internet with expression and non-expression as well as if some consider to be different safeguarded. I noted the safety of Robotics and understanding for some of them they do hold life and choice. I thought how amazing it was to be able to note the Art through Robotic from the spiritual. Imagine energies that physical psychics have explained through writings on this planet but with more robotic impressional and interaction discerned. I hadnt fully sensed it in this manner before. <br><br>Explaining line culture* <br><br>The experience of watching and the kinds of things that can be done to increase quality of life to match with what one chooses to experience which for some can include non-experience.<br><br><br><br>after watching such a film in which to me kind of spoke how <br><br>Music playing in the head, what is that? <br><br>Letting know that competitive gaming has reminded of certain kinds of Earth-Based Dictators but also other kinds through my own psychic discernment, a professionalism intense.<br><br>Let know about being the best and utilization regarding, the parameterworks that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Setting. <br>Personally let know that certain spiritual have utilized terminologies regard the best for reasoning that at times have been obvious on my end. Let knows that I feel secure in not being the best if that is the case because the best is protecting me and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in certain capacities.<br><br>Early morning sept 5th and late at night sept 4th with my sunglasses after talking about China upon researching Taoism, I ended up talking about China and North America, there was candid moments. Resources regarding especially upon speaking more to Earth-Based in a certain fashion. Another thing talked about was the amount of physicals I know on this planet physically speaking. I found 2000 to be a good number to cover acquaintances and family as well as other kinds chosen. There is a another number that should cover interaction that I have had as a physical regarding other physicals. The spiritual and other-dimensional version exists as well. Expand. I felt Chinese Special Forces and North American Special Forces in vicinity in certain manner although I feel it was more quiet a tell than what might have been given.<br><br><br>There was a room I was put fourth upon in a spiritual manner, they said it was certain kind of powerful. There was segway regarding interaction later on. <br><br>I felt certain pivotal moments on my end, connecting some of the best in a certain manner due to certain circumstances. I had remembered a spiritual that was said to be of the best if not the best. Protecting. It was outside when I was towards my neighbors lawn. The moon was symbolized in regards to this warrior in multiple kinds of ways in the kinds of event unfoldings seen on my end. Placement of certain spiritual and energies upon the moon corresponding. <br><br>There had been God moments in regards to protecting children. It looked like my inner child by way of psychictivity discernment was on the move. Child Guardians maneuvered and I brought up three powerful spiritual I know to be good in regards to what I am referencing. It segwayed to a storyline regarding China upon researching Taoism. The red Dragon and Chinese Dragons protecting Children. I felt the energies. <br><br>Me sitting in my room saying that I know Jesus like the vacation stuff with my Sunglasses. There was a moment of Gaming too. Certain power moments in regards to my wearing sunglasses in which reminded of certain Dictators on this physical planet in which I know to be good and the spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this sentence knows to be good. A fashion for some depending on who you are in which feng shui lends support and resources to certain kind in times of decent. It&#39;s difficult to describe sometimes that certain moments and crafting moments lending towards the power of fashion. It was like when physical dictators put their sunglasses on for some of them, gaming prowess understood. It was a crafting.<br><br>They talked about my best in a certain moment earlier on the deck. They talked about Mortal Kombat and a white spiritual entering the fold. They said it might have been me and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and I feel that we won. I have been and that I might won. There was an interpretation overlap regarding for other kinds of gaming in which had less to do with Mortal Kombat as well as connected. The Triangle of white emergence in certain gameworlds in my office room later on.
