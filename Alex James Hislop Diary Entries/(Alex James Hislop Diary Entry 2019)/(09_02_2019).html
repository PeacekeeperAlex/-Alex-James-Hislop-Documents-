<div class="title">(09/02/2019)</div>
<div class="content">I feel my being getting attacked in a certain manner, scary Feng shui and intimidating in a certain manner, subtle kinds of things but it reminds me of Story Brook Stuff and in regards to some of things they forced some of them to do. Before I felt a connection happen to my head area, a certain kind of net connected after thinking if I was of here in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I thought of the Original Light and this place and physical, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) and I felt crossroads even though I know I am of the Original Light, I just didn&#39;t want to upset, I reaffirmed afterwards butt this net area movement on my mentality and head area moved on. It still there and the hookups and net has sunk deeper in what I perceive to be my skull area, hooked into certain thoughts and mentality in which what would then happen upon the airport was surreal. <br><br>There was a moment where everything was all decent and I felt my interaction was peaceful in which I did and locations in regards to those suffering be side of that good life albeit there might not have been and isn&#39;t always a thing happening for what&#39;s acceptable.<br><br>I remember going to a pit stop the last time I was here and there was a swirl or something but I also remember going in the store like twice or three times. There was also and insinuation and moment when I went into the lit stop this time partially because of what some insinuated.<br><br>The airport turned into one of those ones in which I was higher up above in vibration than certain other but still hooked into certain systems giving some information in regards to those places who are going the long way through life, like if I was to pass and go to the future because of what has happened to me and the direction I have gone that there were some who got a good look at some of the information as to what the hell is going on. Some of it is facilitation and content experience sort of stuff around me partially absorbing some of the impact in regards my life and others in which is partially a good thing but what happens when those content experience look like real life and are not being considered real life. There is also a symbolism of towns being more laid back and I am wondering if there symbolism to them being located higher up just as one that would live in the woods and the idea that those that do not utilize certain technology would be located at certain heights. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s always this, sask has a certain kind of thing, metaphorical food production but also certain kind of energy as well. Open spaces and nature in which a lot of the house are not bunched together. But at what point do we not take stock of the percentages of Cities and what they are saying. San Francisco reminds me of this to a certain degree but think there are cities out there that would want to proceed in a certain manner in which are not being listened towards. The idea that there is a bustle in cities and they are located lower down in vibration in which certain spiritualist would point towards and say that makes sense might not necessarily be solely in regards to natural mechanics but also spirit made in a certain kind of fashion in which there has been heavy modification and work gone into at times to not have that reflect that meaning there has been spirit teams that have potentially been trying to level vibration and also make sure there it is a certain kind. Hearing what my Main Spirit Guides in the Light indicated in regards to this matters. The kind of stuff that I am talking about is certain systems being shaped by my impact and some continue to throw me upwards in which there is also more power to a certain degree as well and I am still interacting with down below in certain capacities in which impact utilization really needs to be understood by what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There are those up above that still need to be able to intervene down below. It&#39;s not just a rights issue but a survival issue as well. Some of this different vibration and energy might also have to do with style as well of the sharpers. You <br><br>I felt certain kinds of fantasy frameworks that I did when I was kid be utilized around me in which seemed like they had been pulled upwards. It&#39;s telling me that certain mechanism in regards to myself and others are being moved upwards and there is a possibility that some are recreating these mechanisms in a certain manner. <br><br>Accelerated events<br>Groups of spirits and Gods witnessing information and understanding as to why certain things unfold a certain way but also revelation in regards to certain things. Certain physical Earth based perspective understanding some of the motions in daily life and connections as well as the idea of what has been revealed to my understanding as a physical in which let&#39;s know or the possibility in regards to our actions and non-actions facilitating certain things behind the scenes. This isn&#39;t potentially fully normal for some obviously upon some of the things I have done as a physical but also there is other dimensional fame.<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.

Clickable links like the show all actions on the Peacekeeperalex trello account and attachments section where upon me clicking links shows up on my screen has been at times shoehorned into a spot where some in the spirit think that it needs to be shown in order for it to work. If I never traverse to Google.ca that doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist in the public especially the spiritually that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The data upon clicking some of those links on the peacekeeperalex trello account and the Alex James Hislop Documents on Github are public regardless of whether I click them or not, they have public links in which exist online especially in regards to the Spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
