<div class="title">(04/18/2019) &quot;Keeping the Dream Alive&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>So it segways from yesterday&#39;s seemingly extension of the so called past events in regards to the 16th, in which was to have already been partially passed and dealt with in a certain manner. I recorded an audio entry in regards to yesterdays events in w hich hit home and I played it over the Peacekeepers discord server the peacekeepers Communication channel. One april 16th, 2019 there was a large gathering of dimensional interaction and I felt that some of it was in my atmospheric and when I went outside on the grass it really felt like the present or at least seemingly was around in which made the interaction in my office feel like it might have been either a content experience, a certain kind of existence overlap and/or the past. A lot of dimensional advocations and definitions in regards to lines that my Main Camp as well as lineage and history. I ended up getting livid and incredulous near the end of the meeting on my end or at least it might have signalled the end of the meeting on my end. I got upset because of the amount of harm and hurt that has happened to me and others(defined by my Main Camp) in this life. I looked at what I had done in the physical and the response while specifically looking at it from the dimensional rights perspective and lost my temper and basically said that as one of the physicals in the room the way I have been treated is unacceptable. The amount of harm I have been forced to do, the amount of shitty lives forced to live, the life stealing at times, the amount of dead in regards to my defense, the amount of psychological harm forced upon me, the amount of pain and suffering said to have happened, the breach of rights issues the things that have happened to my process, the trap utilization in regards to my life, the timeline stuff, the amount of Justice and Law invoked in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated when I wanted safety and rehabilitation in the ways that my Main Camp indicated, The desentization in regards to certain concepts, the utilization of my forms, the innocent collateral and others(defined by my Main Camp) all extends beyond what is normal and to be quite honest I want to swear about whatever became normal become I can&#39;t accept what has become to normal to be part of my normal and others(defined by my Main Camp) normal. The worst part about it is if this has reached others especially in regards to the others physical that my Main Camp indicated. Certain tells can be facilitated but there is things in which let me know that what people experience correlates with some of the things that have happened to me and societal acceptance of certain things I felt like there might have been physicals on screen and within their own processes and not so in regards to this meeting and although some of it looked not to be quite what some think it would be when some of the physicals view this process I still feel some of them know what&#39;s going on in this process especially on this night and understand some of what took place, on the recording that I did on the April 18th, 2019 someone channeled through in regards to what some of them might have said during a certain moment and I agree, that I am an Amateur in a certain manner but don&#39;t deserve whatever the heck it was the I got, the regardless matters because it tells of the underlying problem of what other are going through and if were so damn well protected then I can move on with my life in a certain way.The furthermore has to do with spiritual reaction and interaction in regards to my advocations in the fashion that seems to be that it is needed at times and the life utilization in regards to it tells me that either there are those still being harmed in certain manners. There have been many different conflict and wars to present themselves within my process but at a certain point you can only go there for so long and the situating in regards to certain things has made it something that some might not fully expect it to be as in targetings and such. It&#39;s a start but not everything and it&#39;s potentially partially why there is still things <br><br>Moving upwards and downwards in which is not really moving at times those trying to get somewhere in which is being facilitated to not get to where it need to go like a looping escalator.<br>Those time frames in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the amount of time it&#39;s supposed to be until the arrival of the destination and others(defined by my Main Camp)  <br>Utilization of certain things in regards to brimstone culture to be able to implement in certain society. Like being able to fruit that are shaped like beings head and the fruit part looks like brains. Being able to get porridge from jerking off a phallic object and other kinds of stuff. Being able to bet the shit out of each other in a living room gladiatorial sport where we don&#39;t have to feel pain and suffering from it. Where we can invite our friends to be a part of the gladiator crowd. Torture sims that seem so life-like with the perfect safeties to keep us who we want to be in which can pertain to brimstone mentality. Those constant fight areas where people below can utilize to still be in the fight always if you wanted and in ways where you don&#39;t necessarily have to be hurt so bad if you didn&#39;t want to be hurt so bad where the aggressor can still feel satisfied by the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
