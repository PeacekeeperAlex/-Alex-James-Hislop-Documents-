<div class="title">(07/09/2019) &quot;This is Over&quot;</div>
<div class="content">- We got to a point yesterday where I was sitting in my room and the amount of immorality that was said to have taken place because of my interaction as well as others was fairly outlandish at least on my end. I feel like if that interaction is the cause then maybe I need to switch it up and taking the road four to six months from now upon seeing if interaction is still problematic that I can a certain stance in the dimensional live in which I might already be taking to a certain extent. <br>- There was this moment where some powerful people came from the sky. This was after an event earlier in which said that I and some others had gotten attacked. Again multiple let knows in the channel that that might have been the case in the spiritual and that they didn&#39;t fully know who got attacked. I am uncertain if I was attacked or not, or whether the others were attacked either. Anyhow, something changed in regards to Authority interaction in this process and has been changing. The difficulty in regards to my own process is that I haven&#39;t been trying to trap certain spirits and beings, I have been trying to get myself moved to the areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I really want 42 Franklin Beach Road to be located in the areas that my Main Camp indicated pertaining to the Original Light and/or the Light existences that my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. It&#39;s been working that way in a certain kind of manners where it&#39;s been accepted that some of that might be the case especially in regards to certain interaction. That on my property in regards to the Home and Hearth that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that it is recognized to be of the Areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Regardless there was moments in my living room where there was certain conflict and the energies around myself completely changing. <br>- There was said to be something happening on an Multidimensional stage. That there was War and Conflict taking place already in a certain capacity. Some lament that it might be a stage that some would consider to be a world War but I think that that might not be the case. A big War nonetheless. That certain events were happening around myself that weren&#39;t supposed to necessarily take place right now. Some of this conflict having to do with a certain direction in which was tried that was attacked at times in which some were trying to have fail. It&#39;s not just process politics, this is supposedly on a much larger scale for what&#39;s acceptable. <br>- There was a forum with interaction supposedly in regards to Earth Authorities in which was put in the cross fire and forced to go a certain way. Earlier there was certain physical going a certain way partially by way of the revelation of certain Data upon some traversing here when it&#39;s been claimed at times to have been because of spiritual culture around earth not really able to go anywhere else but upon transportations that my Main Spirit Guides indicated it looks that for some of the culture that things where being built here to solidify I presence. One in which is supposedly at war with us at times and there has been moments where physicals on this physical planet earth were being attacked. I do feel like there is a bit of a setup in regards to some of it, like people getting attacked in regards to  channel interaction yesterday as well as physicals supposedly getting attacked. I feel some of it wasn&#39;t true but there can not deny that some of it has been truth in multiple kinds of ways, there was an interaction earlier which said that we were looking to the past in regards to some of it which proved certain interactions and conflict were taking place. This idea for some that they want to be placed Spiritually where my Main Spirit Guides indicated while others don&#39;t want to be involved in the events currently unfolding in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>- The interaction within this process was said to be changed partially by way of something being over, dimensions being moved away from my process and access in regards to 42 Franklin Beach Road barred in regards to some.  <br>- Immorality I feel continues to be attacked in certain ways, this past week I have wondered if it was the truth that my interaction and the changes, like going from argumentative to calm and well mannered as well as the interaction I have been experiencing getting more moral as time passess was harming certain sects of immorality as well as others that my main Spirit Guides indicated. The one thing about this early morning had to do with rejecting multiple kinds of dimensional existence in different kinds of ways and I wondering if there are some in the mix that were kicked out of this process that aren&#39;t supposed to be which speaks of sides of personal and sides of conflict. The idea that you might like a dimensional existence but upon certain conflicts them being on the opposite side of the war and/or battle. How is my personal contrasting with this new turn events yesterday and what exactly does that mean? There is a reason I and others(defined by my Main Camp) look around to make sure something dirty isn&#39;t happening. <br>- Certain banners and groups attacking yesterday with a big power shift taking place in which some of the bad guys lost certain kinds of power. As they were attacking it was noted that this was taking place. When bad guys attacked there was an audible shift and different kind of forming up in regards to the Good guys. Peoples leaving certain areas and spirits moving to where they need to go in regards to this conflict. I felt like certain kinds of exchange programs finish and unravel to where it ended up.<br>- It carried over to today and I was wondering what kind of event took place yesterday in the night regards to forming up and what that looks like in regards to Earth. It felt like it wasn&#39;t just on my end and that some of it was in regards to other portions of earth. <br>- I printed out the (AJHD) Solvenia information which only pertains to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light. I also printed out the (AJHD) Solvenia Access and (AJHD) Solvenia Access Viability information which again only pertains to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light which my Main Spirit Guides can let know of the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. I put the print outs on earth, one page in my back yard and another on the side. I also put the (AJHD) Earth Gods information out on the road and put the (AJHD) Main Spirit Guides and (AJHD) Main Camp information on my Driveway. A connection with Earth and others as well as the outside world by doing that but it would still work as well if it was in my Office I feel to a certain degree. Not to mention this information is online. <br>- Upon going to bed I felt multiple kinds of fallings on my end but a certain kind in which I feel was potentially a mixed bag although there are aspects which didn&#39;t feel that way. They brought up that night where I had saw the skinny Triangle-head being as well as higher up spirits interacting with this process. I remember waking up and going in the kitchen which some were sort of in Awe in regards to the current events taking place. Seemingly linked to the experiences that night and another that was brought up was the Light switching, portions of the Light moving downwards and upwards in regards to switching certain things up. Early Morning is a starred event in regards to what took place on my end and it&#39;s continuing today with the interaction as well as other kinds. There was all start sort of feng shui and cover in regards to certain aspects but at what point will that be used against us. Yeah, I am not certain if this has to do with the Left or not but I am uncertain where they stand on this one. <br><br>- I feel a lot of the decisions that some have to make should start with being able to make those decisions. I know that i have felt at times that I haven&#39;t been able to go certain routes at times by way of circumstances and yeah, at times I have ignored that in which some have been harmed because of that, I am sorry. There is still those in situations in which would choose a certain way would certain circumstances be met and to meet those circumstances there is probably some saying the similar things in being able to meet those circumstances.
