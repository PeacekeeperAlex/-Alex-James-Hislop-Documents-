<div class="title">(09/14/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- Early morning ride from a stranger set the tone in which I discerned a good spirit energy coming from her. She drove me home when she didn&#39;t have too and it felt like a message from God. I have felt these before the God works in mysterious way types in which has been seen and discerned and I have felt literal mechanics in regards to such phenomenon in which has spurred faith. There was a moment when I got home and I felt my manners had been give a much needed refresher. It was a bit of culture clash but not as much as some would think to be true because of how I feel and some of the direction this process has been heading. Moving away from argumentatives, at least trying but for the most part has been staying from some, couple bouts this past couple weeks although the Sask trip I feel hardly counts upon some of the events that took place. <br>- Conflict before I left and some saying it was turn into a dog fight. Looking like multiple kinds of energy happenings while I was at the Gem Theater, updates from the last time I was here in multiple regards. Higher up above and potentially in different area, super clean energies even past those clouds of energies that I discerned in my dream pertaining to the Supers on the Baseball Field. I am not certain why some were tying to turn it into a fight or why there was going to be a fight but it might have to do with some of the events that have been happening at times in regards to certain Areas and again I have seen it happen multiple times where some try to get me to talk about big subject in which even that isn&#39;t really a decent enough reason but again the argumentatives to get me to angering or upset invoked maybe to soften the blow of certain revelation that I don&#39;t deserve to be attacked which if claimed to be reasoning for others to be attack potentially vindicates them as well. This isn&#39;t always a revelation though and one of things where certain physicals know about this process and certain other dimensionals know about this process. One of the things spoken of was multiple aspects of myself venturing fourth, some of which still potentially connected to me in certain manners. I think some were a part of certain conflict that had unraveled. On the way there it was sort of said to be Good against Evil to be truth and from my lens that was what it looked like. Of course the smooth Feng Shui happens this sort of mentality that helps with everyday society getting on when conflict is thundering but when you get down too it that&#39;s really what it is. It was even seen after the film had ended and during to a certain degree on my end but they do good work in making people feel comfortable and safe during those conflicts at times for certain people. There was a certain group that felt that I should just stop interacting with them but the truth is that it has been changing and there has been tries to stop interacting with certain kind. This process has been changing now for a while, it is sadness in regards to leaving those behind and also not interacting with those kind that some have labelled brimstone as well as Greasy for some. There have been a lot of really good spirits in the mix in different areas I continue to move upwards and onward from. It&#39;s been an evolution through all of the Conversation and defense work, through all <br>- I woke up and felt in regards to what I have associated in regards with the stimuli chills to be affected. Chills you can feel throughout your body when something inspirational happens as well as something touching but also when sometimes when something scary happens or spooky. There was a puncture in my back and there were some chills that fell away from what I have discerned there to either be a certain kind of other dimensional boy holding these chills or a certain kind of housing in regards. There has been other stimuli spiritually this past couple days as well in which has told of other kinds of changes and maneuvers in the spirit. <br>- The perception of talking about violent video games and looking at certain kinds of immorality alternatives strictly from a video game perspective in which was said to have been affected pending certain conflict and Spiritual attack. <br>- Certain kinds revealed in regards to certain interaction. It&#39;s amazingly how quickly seemingly the tone of certain kind change upon being busy and defending as well as living life change at least what reflects in g regards to this process. The day before a certain ind claiming the interaction needs to change but also somewhat ignoring that it had changed. That it did change and pointing towards one fight upon me bringing up the interaction that has been present upon pursuing intimacy in the privacy of my own home. Ignoring the key facts that this process has been changing for some of them anyhow not all of them. Some feel it has been changing but that I should just ignore the bad for some to claim later on that&#39;s why the interaction continues but forgetting I was only talking with those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated throughout my entire life. I have said it enough times I feel, more than enough for some and too much for others. If you would have asked behind the scenes in regards to my other dimensional selves. It was subtle but some of the things understood in regards to some of the Good groups yesterday to my ever thanks to some of them was this certain line of interaction needs to change with emphasis in regards to not speaking to certain bad spirit. The line that some say in regards to certain things, like operating with bad intention in regards to certain actions and how that somehow is seen in the spirit and is lamented upon even going with what your Main Spirit Guides indicated, some use it as a crutch but I have been using it as a literal that I only want my Motivation to reflect what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. It&#39;s also a different line compared to when you choose to prompt actions to be what your Main Spirit Guides indicated especially from down here incarnate in the physical and other-dimensional. There are some that choose certain lines and then fall back that they only went with what their Main Spirit Guides indicated, there are some that choose lines but first and foremost choose what their Main Spirit Guides indicated and their are those that only choose what their Main Spirit Guides indicated. The talk veers to proxy suppression at times within the spirit in which has been noted on my end but potentially not as bad as insinuated. Anyhow it felt like a bit of a save for some still claiming the line of not interacting with certain kind behind the scenes. Some spirits literal needed it for survival.<br>- Multiple things, conflict upon laying down on the couch and I could feel those energies in a certain manner. I am not certain though if some of the conflict is what some think it to be. I woke up and I remembered a dream in regards to someone and the lens the dream was strange like farther from me, but regardless they accused supposedly me of harming a dog in which was shown to not be the case in a certain manner. I am not certain that&#39;s truth but there was something about it that told of a disparity that was taking place and a rage being created. <br><br>Advocationals:<br>Truth Teams that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>Psychictivty Teams that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>Segway and subject changing teams that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.and other kinds similar that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>Horror Icons that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>(Talking about doing things for spirits and being able to facilitate, that line let know of yesterday that if I would talk about it, it would be over, for some that sort of stuff where we could do thing like speak to someone or convince someone of something and that sort of stuff to be able to potentially lend towards helping. Some of this has nothing to do even with like stuff that we could when we pas and spirits within process needing us to do that kind of stuff, process related and more to do with certain spirits that have wanted certain things to be done potentially for a while)<br>The utilization of things that are happening in other places with similar form in regards to the then accused of attacking some in which are innocent.
