<div class="title">(10/21/2019) &quot;</div>
<div class="content">Mood: Scared, Upset, Calm, quiet.<br>Quotes: “When you can’t find the sunshine, be the sunshine”<br>Thought: The End is most Terrible and Beautiful Concept.<br>Horoscope: It&#39;s time to admit that your hectic lifestyle is catching up with you. Today you must start to get organized. Waiting until the last minute to take care of important tasks only causes anxiety. Make a list of everything you need to get done and prioritize it. Consider yourself lucky if you can confine the list to one page!<br>Horoscope Actuality: On my end I actually feel like even working on getting the some of the things that I want to get done has been the problematic. Low Energy mixed with Low motivation and a note of Laziness has been some of the problem. You throw in some of the events that take place in which my interaction has been reflecting and it adds an exert percentage of not working on some of the things I had been hoping to work on done. It&#39;s also passion and happiness. What I want to do should not feel like work to myself. <br><br>Activity:<br>- I had a vision yesterday, I doing combat training as a female with another female and she killed me and when she did, something snapped between the two knees of in the empty space below my groin. It felt like a head snapping but also felt like a glow stick snapping and I felt spirit rush towards the area not necessarily to heal me but for some it might have been but rather to go inside the area as if certain spirit rushing towards a glow stick lit it up. Some sort of transportation. <br>- There was multiple kinds of battles waiting in the wings over my head area in which have been gathering around me supposedly waiting. Like they will will bring up a certain subject in spiritual communication at times and I will feel energies rushing towards either side of me like on opposite sides of the battlefield in the spirit. This has happened multiple times this week. One having to do with Fans supposedly, another having to do with a conflict talked about on my fathers side of the Family but I am not certain it has anything to do with them. Certain spirit have brought up certain topics and at times tried to tether in regards to my physical family in which they don&#39;t really have anything to do with some of it. There was another one that happened last night except that it didn&#39;t really just hang over me this time but rather some went at it. I could feel energies and attack happening in multiple regards. <br>- There was certain spiritual releases yesterday. In which on my end was depicted in multiple forms. There was a man depicted in which he looked like he was in prison. It was said he was related to another spirit but I am not certain if that&#39;s true. <br>- Memory was affected by certain kind this day in certain spirit teams had taken certain memories from certain spirit. There was also a problematic with Psychological defense as well. I could discern spirits not remembering certain subjects. I could discern certain kinds of angry spirit as well that were operating in fashion in which they did not want too. <br>- There was a moment where a certain spirit came around and attached certain things to my computer in letting know of what happened in regards to spiritual history pertaining to whatever I looked up. I ended up going through timelines of history on Google and scrolling as well as going through a portion of my Diary entries in which there was said to be an attachment displaying what happened in regards to spiritual pertaining to some of the events scrolled. A certain kind of truth was around but I am not certain that was who had channeled through to let know that there was a certain kind. One of the things recognized is that in regards to the events that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to October  20th afternoon and night as well as early morning October 21st, 2019. There was a certain kind of discussion happening in regards to past Earth-Based utilizing future information that would emerge on Earth-Based in a certain fashion. Some are saying that certain events were smoke and mirrors do ignore this point and that it was a good thing but I feel the discussions would have been decent for some of it anyhow to a certain degree. The idea that some were trying to create an interaction around here to facilitate certain kind of actions but also that some were trying to claim that some of the past informational reliance and actions that happened were not in regards to me and because of me but rather in regards to someone else, and someone elses information. It was refreshing to see some honest action in regards to spiritual history to be true but I feel that some used this action to try and cause difficulties. <br>- I felt my levito to potentially be moved in which I could discern not feeling to pursue intimacy and that there is sometimes a feeling in regards to that in which was either changed to reflect not to pursue those kinds of activities or they moved those energies away from me in a certain sense.<br>- I also noted a battle of the fans certain kind of conflict potentially taking place. There needs to be knowing and understanding as to what kind of battle took place. What exactly are some of these spiritual turbulence taking place?<br>- There has been multiple kinds of advocations verbally done within the past couple days and some really decent actions perpetuated. <br>- Earlier on we had been moving towards a certain interaction this past couple of days in which moved off or got moved.<br>- There was a moment where true good was around myself and certain discussions happened but it didn&#39;t take long for some of them to be ignored and some of them to leave. It ended up turning into a battle of sorts around myself and in regards to my home. <br>- It should be understood the gravity of my actions at times have been heightened where I will affect and others will affect certain things by way of our actions to a heightened degree. Imagine saying something and that one comment affect billions and trillions of spirits. What needs to be understood is that there is varying degrees of this around other kinds of spirit as well in which lends towards that conversation that I am not the only one that has a certain kind of lens upon it and that there is higher spiritual information in play to protect certain kind in which is at times not being acknowledge and also that seems to be changing. <br>- There was a review of Statistics from Higher Light to the dimensional existences that my Main Spirit Guides indicated about Teamwork<br>- A certain Spirit came around me in regards to Teamwork but I still only go the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated and operate in a certain fashion pertaining to Team work. I am distanced in a certain regard for a reason. It doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t try to proceed with teamwork or that I don&#39;t try to help in multiple ways but it&#39;s not necessarily what some want it to be. <br>- I have noticed a certain kind not want me to reflect feminine and direction that I want to be partially by way of operating but also in regards to utilization in regards to frameworks and things of that nature. Likability as well. Disparities of Hybrid Styles especially True good and who you want to be. <br>- I voted in the Canadian Elections and felt a certain kind of smooth energy and platform kind of feeling, similar to one of the nights in Sask although fairly different with fae impressions but certain psychic stimuli reminding me of Midnight in Garden of Good and Evil impressions. Smooth kind of clean energies and sight in regards to certain spiritual. There was something to do with community as we went to three locations trying to find the voting booth. Something to do with my father today as well and some trying to continue to further certain actions and excusing in regards to my physical family and potentially spiritual as well.<br>- There was a moment where I felt hurt and pain in the back of my neck lower down where I usually feel chills it was let know that certain spirit attacked and that there were other infrastructure potentially affected. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for the release of what my Main Spirit Guides indicated daily in regards to this marking and advocation that my Main Spirit Guides indicated to facilitate the categories that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>Advocationals:<br>Spiritual Information helping us down here behind the scenes.
