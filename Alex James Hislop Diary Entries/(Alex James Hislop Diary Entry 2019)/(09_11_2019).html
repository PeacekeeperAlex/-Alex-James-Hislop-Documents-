<div class="title">(09/11/2019)</div>
<div class="content">- I noticed angelic impression today upon waking up. A misty white impression that does remind me of Good, not the kind that some equate to certain cataracts in which might also be good energies too, I am not certain. Either way it reminds of certain kind at times. What does this have to do with 9/11? and what does it have to do with June 28th, 2019 where I discerned angels and angelics impressions as well as did certain avocational in regards to Angel Clarifications.<br>- It felt like there was a bit of a hold on something on multiple ends as this is the Anniversary of September 11th, 2001. Where the Planes struck the Twin Towers. I did discern a certain kinds of topic and discussion and I let know of what I had discerned in regards to what I saw pertaining to multiple thick lines on a map in regards to energy placement. I also described multiple energies in regards other events as well like the Assassination of JFK, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr..<br>- Moments throughout this past week letting me know of certain tactic being perpetuated in regards to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. From making it seem like I made things worse, to threatening via memory as well as moving from certain areas that my Main Sprint Guides did not indicated for myself to be moved and potentially hiding the truth in regards to what exactly happened to me and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated supposedly based off of this life to certain degree to stealing and taking over certain kinds of things in which was not agreed upon in a certain manner for some of it as well as put me in situations pertaining to intimacy in which is not clouth and understandable at all especially when noting the supposedly authority energy waiting in the wings and the mislabelment of that in multiple regards. The manipulation and lies in regards to this process of some of the things that had happened in the 80s and 90s in regards to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides is quite shocking at times. I don&#39;t know the full extent of it but what really happened? Past has been brought up as well in multiple regards and that has been one of the lenses seen. <br>- Another kind affected these days to said were those doing things without consent to save people, like ruining experiences and things of that nature. although today they said there was a bounce back regarding, I am not certain if that&#39;s what&#39;s been happening with this kind anyhow<br><br>Advocationals: <br>Those creating disclaimers, testifications, advocations and other kinds in which we have seen spurred into action upon other actions, non-actions and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides). One of the greatest thing some could do is safeguard those that are relying on the informational placement and actions as well as non-actions of those in front of the scenes to be able to help. <br>Documents and informational Placement in regards to the promises that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and understanding that some of us are still not wanting to give up down here. 1) You have some that do not want to compromise how they live and how they proceed in regards to the quality of their lives. 2) You have some that need saving in the mix of this within interaction with some in the first group. 3) There are those promised better life later on where no compromising need have happen upon compromising in current lives. 4) One one hand I want to create document in which safeguards promises of the future in better life for some in regards to earth-based but I also want it to be understood that there are those that still do not want to compromise in regards to their lives and it doesn&#39;t mean for some of them that they don&#39;t want saving to have happen but rather be able to live their lives. <br><br>Tread lightly on this next paragraph. <br>1) I create disclaimers, advocations and other kinds in which some action attach some of their some of own sort of stuff to my actions especially in regards to advocations and disclaimers as well as other kinds in which potentially lends power towards both. 2) We start to understand that there those in which are waiting for myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated to put certain kinds of informational placement in play to then put their own in play. 3) How did it get this way? 4)Some looked at some of these that were attaching actions seemingly good and said that it was supposed to be this way anyway, like there was suppose to be certain defenses and other kinds that were not employed and deployed in certain moments but rather later. There is multiple kinds in regards to action attachment and not all of it was suppose to be because there are some that feel otherwise and say some of it wasn&#39;t suppose to be as well. The balancing act of it all must be impressive but how did some of those get t o point where they would have to really upon some in front of the scenes. <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.

Clickable links like the show all actions on the Peacekeeperalex trello account and attachments section where upon me clicking links shows up on my screen has been at times shoehorned into a spot where some in the spirit think that it needs to be shown in order for it to work. If I never traverse to Google.ca that doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist in the public especially the spiritually that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The data upon clicking some of those links on the peacekeeperalex trello account and the Alex James Hislop Documents on Github are public regardless of whether I click them or not, they have public links in which exist online especially in regards to the Spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
