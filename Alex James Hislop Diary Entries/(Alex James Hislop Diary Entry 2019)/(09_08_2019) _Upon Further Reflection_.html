<div class="title">(09/08/2019) &quot;Upon Further Reflection&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- One of the things that I have felt present itself on multiple occasions this past couple days has had to do with revealing certain information of events that might and potentially would take place in a certain context. Specifically seen from the lens of Waring and supporting certain good guys at least on my end there has been three or four reveals which I have discerned to potentially be decent. The difficulty in regards to this for myself and others is that in the wind at times it&#39;s been felt that future hasn&#39;t been supporting some of us in a certain capacity and it&#39;s not necessarily future in which I am pointing towards. To be truth I don&#39;t know what I am pointing towards in this context but those that discern future, there has been a bit of a look from those reveal certain things in which at times has felt to be not necessarily decent although in the mix with a potentially bigger decent. Like revealing certain things that were suppose to be for me in the future in a manner where some bad guys utilize as well as another one in which has had to do with a bit of a cheapening of story on my end in regards to myself in which actually might be done by good spirits for a reason. <br><br>- There has been certain extenuations in regards to each Chapter I have read in regards to Stephen King&#39;s it, from some of the reveals during the detective scenes, there seemed to be things in regards to that Chapter in which reminded of the ignoring during certain kinds of processes from authorities and policeman not just in regards to my process but also others, like a bit of a reminisce in regards to some of the things that have put cops and detectives in difficult situations and why they choose the way they go, to the Characters popping out of Short Chapters within Six Phone Calls. I have noticed not only personality traits that symbolizes with these characters in regards to myself whether be the comedic, the scared, the cowardly, the straight shooter, the leader, the writer, the lover, the dreamer, the fighter, the abused, the small, the hero, the historian and the local. I have seen these archetypes, we have seen these archetypes but have we seen that as much as we think we have within the context of this Literature, film series and movie? It&#39;s everywhere, literally in regards to English language but also in regards to the shaping of ourselves. He is considered one of the biggest Earth-Based Villains and the Fear of Clowns has much to thank him for but it goes beyond what some would think it&#39;s about. I have been able to discern from the shaping of physicals to some of the mentality of spirit realm in regards to this time period as well as some of the events unfolding especially in regards to the release of It: Chapter 2 and the references in regards to Earth-Based content is myriad. There has been barely not one movie I have watched within the past couple years where there isn&#39;t reference to the Character of Pennywise and other kinds within. From lines of dialogue to inflection changes, to expression and literal physical shaping and it&#39;s a decent metaphor at times. It&#39;s also speaking through these kinds of notices that not every earth-based physical. Here this, I become a Psychic, I start to understand immorality culture exist behind the scenes in which some it is interacting with some of us and I start to understand Cinema culture in that some of these Characters that we are witnessing on screen and elsewhere are potentially more real than we ever could have imagined. I start to witness that I had more of a connection to certain characters and film than I previously thought regardless of if it is what was portrayed in my process at times. I start to learn about story metaphoricals and the signs of life and that we could have literal musings within Character and they us in multiple kinds of ways. The power of story and symbolism in regards to our life has been spoken of before in regards to spiritualists writings nad I bet there are some that are right on the money but from what I have glanced and it&#39;s a small glance it seems to graze the literal of how much story really impacts our lives at times and how much it can shape our lives in which might partially be for a reason and lends towards a realism that says that it&#39;s not always story in regards t our lives right? A disagreeing that some spirit have with each other is a part of the learning in that some fee this is all troy regardless of how some things just happen but what I would witness in my own life pertaining to story would make me realize that I need to literally explain what exactly and how story affects us. A person lives a life and saves somebody within his life and because of certain perception at times it&#39;s not fully understood to literally be one of the Main Spiritual Driving forces behind one of the biggest Comic Book heroes emergence on Earth-Based being that of superman. Some would say this extends beyond just that one story in which the events of that life potentially were also shaped by way of the emergence of such a characters as superman in the future but then again it might not have and the amount of symbolism in regards to certain everyday heroes would be seen and understood to potentially be a part of that storyline and potentially lending towards the spirit to invoke the creation of Superman by way of thought and idea as well as shaping. Again in knowing how spiritual mechanics can work and lend towards the emergence of pop culture and fiction as well as non-fiction in the shaping of events within life and invention as well as other kinds would lend towards a lense in which would develop in regards to myself and others. Literal Spiritual mechanics like that some of us Joes literally could have small and big parts in some of the movies depicted. To understand some of the mechanics and context of this I would also catch on in regards to Channeling in which the idea of channeling spirit when acting and that expression, inflection, body language and other kinds could be in relation to channeling spirit which could and does extend to other-dimensional selves, like a scenes in a movie where a physical speak channeling an other dimensional self in which is also in the movie. <br>- Talk of different kinds of immorality promotion and measuring of certain kind in regards to prompting and invoking more kinds to have happen by way of different kinds of strut. Don&#39;t fall for it, it&#39;s not worth it and when people are attacked and harmed because you forgot you didn&#39;&#39;t have to prove yourself it might be a slog. <br>- There was a bit of a forming up in regards to myself dimensionally. I can feel combining at times of spirits by way of multiple kinds of stimuli, spiritual lens feeling more fluidity, spotlight emphasis at times and change in dimensional anatomy behind the scenes as well as movement towards myself, different kinds of voice atmospherics and channel infrastructure. Other kinds as well not listed but overall I can tell especially when certain combine, queezy at times but it&#39;s not the only change and the only combining. I am not certain if this combing and movement was because of someone in the vicinity or a certain theft that tried to have happen. Not fully certain but multiple tells leading in different directions. It&#39;s probably understood though. Some were leaving so said in regards to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I was said but still reflecting and remembrance in regards to why I dislike some. Not certain if it&#39;s suppose to look that way or if some want me to be upset with some them. <br>- There was also certain kinds of events in regards to pursuing intimacy. One of the greatest things about intimacy for myself is being able to promote love in which can create some of the most amazing intimacy experiences. Although on this particular occasions there was certain spirits harassing and not necessarily in the good way. Certain energies we feel in regards to intimacy are often times spiritual entities around oneself and if the spiritual atmospherics don&#39;t suit the need there can be difficulties.
