<div class="title">(12/02/2019)</div>
<div class="content">There was a point in my life where I continued to talk about big lines, create informational placements, Complain, Argue, Debate and Converse with the Spirit and a large portion was done with my out loud voice. There was also Defense works at times in which I did. What is this worth? It seemed to some spirit that were in Attack that somehow it was these things together that cause some of the attacks and spiritual turbulence to take place. Is this the truth. Can we look over my life and say that there wasn&#39;t spiritual attack beforehand when I was only arguing? Can we say that in regards to a couple years previous as well? What about before then? It&#39;s interesting that some of the topics that I spoke about would come to the rescue. Some of these things for a portion of what I did marked me different then the normal psychic. The normal psychic doesn&#39;t usually have arguments with the spirit? A normal psychic doesn&#39;t usually do defensives informational placement blockings do they? Normal Psychic dealing with some of the topics that I am dealing with? are they? The answer to these questions in regards to Earth-Based in current time frame is that no not to the degree that some would think regarding physicals on this physical planet earth but a surprising variable that remains to be true is that there are psychics out there that have done things similar to myself at times in which does not deserve to receive turbulence of some of the events within my process. They don&#39;t deserve to receive turbulence within their process because of the events within their process. I have wondered if they deserve to receive the turbulence that some of them don&#39;t discern and that some of them discern. Because to be true it looks to be that there has been things happening in which has less to do with them. I don&#39;t know if what they have been saying at times is true. But I look at the population of this planet physically and ask myself am I really the only one. I want to say probably not but sometimes there is a wonder as to whether that is the truth or not. Either way I discerned there to be spiritual events taking place at times in which upon looking at it from another lens is also changing. It&#39;s one of the things some would look towards and say hey, if there was battle taking place and if there was certain kind of events happening than that might be a part of it. But what about the great Peace? What about the other kinds of peaceful events happening that do not have to do with battle? <br> I had wondered if some of the spiritualists on this planet had discerned some of the turbulence that exists and there seems to be spiritually for some a certain kind of boundary and understanding about some of things that are taking place on this planet at times. I have noted there to be many kind of psychics and spiritualist to exist in regards to this earth and others. There exists multiple meetings and groups on this planet. Spiritually it reminds me of a movie I had watched once in which there was a small meet up between certain lobbyists where they speak and share stories about their trade. For the Spiritualist, there might be multiple overlaps in which we are talking and conversing in which can be a form of therapy. There also seems to be an understanding about some of the things that are taking place at times on this earth. It&#39;s almost as if by knowing the secret there might be some special club that presents itself like out of the RPG Games that I play at times. I noticed that some of this has had to do with how one responds in regards to certain societal but what&#39;s interesting is that a lot of the responses are truth. Like if a person asks if his loved ones are watching, those answers invariably pertaining to that they are watching and care are truth. I think it also needs to be understood that in regards to understanding the secret we need to be realistic enough to understand that not all physical and other-dimensional psychics understand some of the darker aspects that exist. There is some that do note that dark and negative spirits exist but are true upon when they speak that there is heaven and enlightenment in which is their to protect.  <br>It&#39;s not always so secretive and it&#39;s not always about ways of operating. Sometimes it&#39;s been about the experiences. The experiences of Spirituality and there are those that exist to safeguard that Spirituality and it&#39;s interesting that there are others that are open about such truth in ways in which doesn&#39;t impact certain spiritual. The question as to what I have written down not deserving to create more turbulence either pops up. The answer to that question is no, it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s a legitimate delving regardless of whether their is certain kind of spiritual battle taking place or not. On one hand it would be critical delving if there was and on the other hand if not a problem then no problem or at least shouldn&#39;t be to a certain degree.<br>There is a story line currently underway in which is seeing certain kind of spirit utilize spirituality in a certain manner in which in the mix is those that utilize spirituality in different albeit similar ways, more viewed to be opportunity and even for some rehabilitation in which another kind<br><br>-(Storyline, utilization of spirituality and certain kind of spiritual in a manner in which is trying to harm which is different than those that have been trying to defend and keep safe in a certain manner. It&#39;s also somewhat different than those in which have been utilize certain spiritual systems as rehabilitation)<br>- (Spiritual attacks throughout then light, I felt teeth knocked in impressions from other dimensional. Late last night some tried to maneuver a certain thing that was taking place, a coming together of sorts in which some tried to get me to talk about big lines but also in obscuring certain kinds of let know and conversation, at least on my end. There are some utilizing the Spiritualist archetype for nefarious reasons at times. There are also been threats and strongarming supposedly in regards to certain kind as well)<br>- (The understanding that there is certain event placement in which are utilizing power and energy upon the utilization of such reasonings as to why certain things are taking place. Like I will experience turbulence within my process and feel that it might be certain events behind the scenes but in which might be some trying to get me to say that it&#39;s events taking place. It sounds far fetched but I feel there is an element of this in the mix, maybe more so in the spiritual as I don&#39;t fully know some of those events. I feel it&#39;s unfair for those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this storyline. Either way I still feel that there is certain happenings that have been a part of the reasoning for some of the things that have taken place in my process taking place. )<br>- (On one hand you have a group that is saying that the need for an excuse is killing certain kind and on the other hand you have certain kind saying that what exactly is being done for the need of an excuse, I feel an employment of certain lines in which is taking the variable away pertaining to whether certain kind deserve to be attacked and whether there is a need for reasonings and excuses.
