<div class="title">(03/27/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>Near the end of the day there was a bit of a blowout after the events of a really solid day and the turbulence of certain police officers showing up by way of deciding to call them and gauging the spiritual reaction. I was aware that there were certain events in regards to Canada that were happening spiritually and I would end up creating the (AJHD) Canadian Armed forces documents right around the same time so it ended up being a bit of a double edge sword but the turbulence did sort of partially stem from earlier interaction with a family member of mine. Yeah, what now... I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for information in regards to Alex James Hislop&#39;s process to be given towards those that my Main Camp indicated and others(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. It kinds of felt like again the process has been going in a different direction after the day before for certain, I am not really certain who got attacked or what fully happened as I feel my process literally shifted dimensionally in a different areas before I received the tell. <br><br>Defense: <br>Cross referencing who I don&#39;t need to show up for by way of being covered in regards to Family, Friends, etc.(defined by my Main) pertaining to moments in their life in which I can help which then I can pull forces, manpower etc.(defined by my Main Camp) from the areas, tiems, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) that my Main Camp indicated to those that I can help utilizing the parameters that my Main Camp Indicated. (IE: cross referencing who I would want to help with those that if was to help would help the overall all that is storyline by helping), I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for what my Main Camp indicated in regards to mine and others(defined by my Main Camp) relationships the way my Main Camp indicated. Those that would take over my life in certain ways upon the dimensional existences below the Light and in other areas that my Main Camp indicated, one of the worries I have is that some not doing in the ways that need to be done to keep peoples safe the way my Main Camp indicated, especially if certain Authority take over from which all of the power they already have in potentially being able to protect people anyhow, have not protected us to the degrees in which is needed to be able to fully achieve safety for what&#39;s acceptable. It&#39;s not meant to upset but it is meant to let know that some might be trying utilize my life and others not to save or protect or even live life but rather purposely sabotage some of the chances and resources in which are located within certain lives as well as for some not be able to utilize the lives to the potentially in which it could be by way of not having enough resources. So either way I look up and say, if it&#39;s an issue of not having enough resources, then I feel it might be needed to revisit certain things to be able to achieve the desired resources in order to achieve safety as well as if it isn&#39;t a matter of resource but rather something else at play, who is it then that is responsible for the peoples below certain areas especially if power is being abused? Some claim to say that we took this venture but full truth on that is not fully known by myself and if it is does that mean they not deserve to be protected? Counting those in circulation that my Main Camp indicated who have worked against myself and those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the amount of live in which it has happened and the lengths of those lives at times is needed, I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for the information pertaining to that to be displayed where my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. The events within this process and how they have unfolded especially being seen from up above and high up when compared with each other is also needed at times. I had been saying it&#39;s the same answer for about a month and a half and what exactly did it turn into by way of the amount of psychological attachment in regards? I am also not certain why in certain places it takes whatever amount of time it does to get upwards moving, some may lament upon having to certain routes but when were literally waiting at doors within the live while working through our lives to move upwards and get tot the places we need to be then why is that fully needed and why isn&#39;t it especially when contrasting and synergizing multiple responses. Arts and crafts to vent and work through my life in regards to issues and problematic in which has presented themselves within my lives and others kinds of things. <br><br>Advocationals: <br>Sex propositions in regards to the spirit realm and ways to do it both brimstone and not so, opportunity in regards to being a super stud in regards to access to all the things that drive feminine genders wild for true and then swoop in regards to certain situations like intimacy happening in regards to certain feminine spirits and being able to give them what they wanted in regards to intimacy and sex for what&#39;s acceptable. So in those areas where that sort of thing happens and punishment happens where intimacy might be on the table and chosen, that sort of thing in putting certain spirit and beings in certain positions to then be able to ease the punishment by way of give them what they wanted as well a compromizations or at the very least a better situation. In which can stack to get peoples out of certain things, like augmentation of mentality, demeanor and even form by way of just walk and the stance changing as the walk happens but in regards to circumstance and situations. Creating places where the game would be to put certain spirits and beings in situations where intimacy takes place in certain fashion where it is consensual in the moment and not so. Hard Day&#39;s Fun creation in regards to recreational getting work done without it feeling like work, Consent based in which can lend towards the quickening of getting this ish to the point we want it to be. The bullshit of some of the hate in regards to myself really makes non sense at the end of the day or even during it because the mindset and opinions that I have presented are not too outlandish in a certain ways many people have those opinion, in fact it&#39;s a baseline for some specifically in regards to quality of life and survival. You were right in regards to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I still want a relationship with Jamie in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Staff Advocationals especially for when I pass on. Advocationals for passing on. Advocationals for being able to stay in the dimensions that my Main Camp indicated as well as getting to where my Min Camp indicated in the Light and others dimensional Existences. <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for help to be protected the way my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for the light to be defended the way my Main Camp indicated.<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. Light; Do what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to these advocations the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and Others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) consider the Light to be what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) consider Far Away Light to be the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are playing the cards that my Main Camp indicated in the moments that my Main Camp indicated especially in regards to the Amount of Times I have been stabbed in the Back Defensive Card to Defend behind our Backs, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
