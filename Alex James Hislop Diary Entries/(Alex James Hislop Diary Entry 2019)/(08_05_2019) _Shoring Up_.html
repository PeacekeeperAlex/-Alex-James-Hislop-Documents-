<div class="title">(08/05/2019) &quot;Shoring Up?&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- I had a certain kind of interaction today which felt like certain kind in my process imploded and I felt inner conflict and dislike in regards to certain kind of work. It was one of the dislikes that was brought up and continued to ty exacerbating Industry and myself. It&#39;s not unheard of for some to dislike certain work within industries and economies there are opinions in regards to favorite work and least favorite work, it exists and is a part of Job searching to a certain degree, it doesn&#39;t extend beyond that in regards to certain kinds of ways of life but it&#39;s not as expanded as some are insinuating in regards to myself and others. I liek work in a certain context but also not so. Because of what I do and others do it shouldn&#39;t have to mean that we need to spend years worth of moment within a single moment of our lives. We shouldn&#39;t be forced to slave labour and other kinds behind the scenes and for myself it extends to those that my main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to life utilization pertaining to myself.<br>- There was another kind of let know that somehow in regards to certain some there was a flip, where it would be considered a certain section of their life to be stolen and not sanctioned in which some point towards what it is and could have been and would have been as what it potentially should be and is. An overlap explaining what it is for those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in which there is systems in which do adhere to that sort of thing as well as other going around in different capacities. <br>- There has been a different kind of interaction some say it might have been in regards to friends and other kinds in regards to myself in which has been interesting upon trying to discern the motivation and tactic in regards to what is taking place. It kind of felt like earth-based kind of landing in regards to my process a certain kind under what seemed to be similar earth kind of style banners and things of that nature. <br>- There was also again earlier exacerbation upon the implosions and things of that nature so said in my process which did look a certain kind as well as exacerbating and strong arming in regards to me going a certain direction in which I am still going the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated are going the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>- Days before it was talked about certain kinds of life utilization like uploading certain life on a pirate bay kind of infrastructure and things of that nature potentially affected to a certain degree in which a targeting might have been happening that was let know to the good guys in regards to that sort of thing pertaining to my liberal approach pertaining to my life in a certain manner. <br>- Another thing that happened yesterday was a afamily kind of style overlap in which ahs been affected to a certain degree. One of the biggest reveals in regards to some of this stuff had to do with the spiritual overlaps that existed in regards to informational placement to a certain degree in which some looked towards my process and basically said what the heck, then why do you need anything to do with the information he creatures as well as others in which partially lent towards that it had less to do with personal even though they have been targeting personal in a certain manner. <br>- The kinds of action attachments that have been happening have been moment in regards to me doing certain kinds of things to partially heighten my actions to partially make it matter in regards to many countless deaths and attacks in regards to my defense but it&#39;s only a partial and some want to do it a certain styles that is utilized in certain ways that can make it seem like that route might not be the way to go. Either way i choose what my main Spirit Guides indicated, we that my Main Spirit Guides indicated choose what my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>- Yesterday a talking in regards to physical in which certain physicals might have been looking upon earth in a certain way, I am curious to understand if there already was some in watching to a certain extent as I feel that might be the case anyhow but upon talking there it kind of seemed like it was go ahead for some in which trying to impact this life and others in a certain manner. Psychologicals of earth was brought up as well in which looked like a large percentage of a certain population utilized in a certain manner but then again that might not be it. One of the thing I spoke of and the main thing had to do with the worshipping of female and the kinds of stuff that happened the day before. <br>-There is also a white washing currently happening in certain manner in which si trying to forget some of the things that have been taking place this past couple days, and emphasis in regards to memory and understanding the current enemy tactics I would advise in regards to this day. There was switch up on my end in which can mean multiple kinds of things. <br>- There is also multiple kindso fl et knows to systems in which I have not been writing down as of yet, I can discern certain kinds but at times I am wondering if they are doing that to get past certain litigation in which there is nothing wrong with that but there is still unknown variables in which I am not privy especially in regards to identify different groups, some of which have been trying to link up. <br>- There is also a battle in the wings is what some were saying, in waiting within the next couple weeks was the times frame if not sooner. It was said to potentially be a personal in regards to some of us to clear some of the air as some conflict in regards ot banners were being overshadowed at times potentially as well as potentially shaking some of the personal out of some of the conflicts taking place in regards to Banners, on the flips side there is also personal where banners conflict is being mixed within and when I saw banner conflict I am referring in this instance to dimensional, non-dimensional, fdaction, government, non-government that sort of conflicts. There has been things where personals have been affected by ways of certain kinds of shoehorning of certain conflict within. <br>- I have definitely been moved to a certain area and /or certain interaction set, I feel morality utilization potentially a topic of discussion in which there might have been some in this process not benefit from the direction today. <br>- Change in interaction so said again, this time life changed by way of different kinds of deployment and I am wondering how much of a suppression of corruption will look in years time. Of course this might a deployable overlap that gets taken somewhere else upon going to sleep as been seen in the past but I am not certain. There seems to be something going on with those that are trying to facilitate an understanding that there is still warfare a foot in certain manners but then again that might be a part of the overlap because we need to know and understand. Note what happens in the processes that my Main Spirit Guides indicated especially if this is a tactic from the bad guys. What is the ripple affect. Of course utilization of the impact and the stealing that continues to go on is interesting to note especially if claimed that it weir impact to begin with, etc.<br><br>Advocationals:<br>Not getting angry in the Far Away Places and life utilization for certain portion considered potentially stolen and not sanctioned. How There would b e no freak outs or anger in regards to portion at all and hasn&#39;t been because that&#39;s what&#39;s it &#39;s considered. <br>Conflicting let knows that there is harm taking place to satiate and help a certain kind but also to bypass certain system configuration conflicting with certain ripple affect systems pertaining to impact upon actions.<br><br>I am Alex James Hislop. My Main Camp is my Main Spirit Guides. I and Others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) testify in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. This includes what my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
