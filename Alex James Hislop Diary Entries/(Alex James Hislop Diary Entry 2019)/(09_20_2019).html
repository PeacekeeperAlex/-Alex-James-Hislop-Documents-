<div class="title">(09/20/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- This day I woke up and I could feel those old systems around me. Yesterday one presented itself,a certain interaction and area. So imagine spiritually how we feel being affected and impacted by dimensional and the interactions around us. Makes sense but as a psychic-medium I am able sense some of that more clearly life when they move certain interactions overlapping us whether it be in the vicinity or not. There are those ones that sometimes we feel throughout life in different moments. There are also certain kinds that we feel maybe once or twice in our lifetime and sometimes it has to do with positive moments and negative moments within our lives. The kind of mentality and demeanor we present in life sometimes shapes the interaction spiritually but from what I have noticed it shouldn&#39;t shape it to such a degree that we can never get out of the traps that we set for ourselves often times unintentionally. Like some not being able to shake the lure of racism upon some of the experiences in which then sometimes can impact spiritual interaction or not being able stop a certain mindset and mentality that again lends towards the interaction within ones life. Within the mix there is disparities in certain areas of the spirit realm in which influencing and manipulation in regards to mindset, mentality, demeanor, behaviors and personality lends towards further disparities upon those influences like not being able to experience certain kinds of positivity upon being negative and vice versa. Again it lends to the shaping of who we are and there is sometimes other selves that fight tooth and nail partially because some of it is impacting their own lives upon being able to understood who they and their other selves want to be. You see through some lives certain changes here and there by just not enough to fully change someone is on the wrong path and to be a le to get that full interaction of what we were going for and it can be unfair. Either way yesterday I saw an interaction that was supposedly around me when I was younger that had to do with when I had depression and sadness as well as linked with my difficulties with direction, leaving home and standing on my own two feet. This interaction and system that came around me supposedly, I don&#39;t remember it being the the larger interaction in regards to my earlier life but it was there I feel in certain capacities specifically when I became sad and withdrawn more so that i already was. I don&#39;t know why it came around me last night but maybe it had to do with a family member. This systems actually reminds me of the sadness I would present upon a certain family member interaction of in which I really feel there is more to the story spiritually than what we did in the physical. Who I would become and the things that I would do lending towards some of the other kinds of stuff that would happen behind the scenes spiritually potentially in regards to past interaction as well but there is something missing and at times not understood. What exactly happened spiritually beforehand to cause certain interaction to be as charged as it is now and God forbid it wasn&#39;t exactly the fame some thought it was.<br>-There are also times when I am unable to discern what exactly is taking place spiritually while still understanding the something is taking shape.<br>- Again going through mythology and faith I stumbled upon a certain God of Death from the Hellenic eras. There was symbolism that I related too in which again was reminiscent of what happened earlier potentially pertaining to certain spirit trying label partly not necessarily to try and affect certain things but there are those i feel that did try to impact. I have had those moments in regards to past happening upon this life in which I would want to know the kinds of things that had happened in a certain context, certain God Spark for sure would want to understand what took place in certain time frames especially in regards to Earth-Based God histories that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. <br>- There was a let know that a higher up Spirit in certain thresholds was causing havoks in cleaner energies and higher vibrations.<br>There was thought in regards to the amount of labellment some have to do in regards to attacking myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated especially in regards to my old soul and higher God sparks partially because of what it looks like from certain perspective, if you factor in AllThatIs, Earth can look fairly small and the utilization of earth-based informational creation being the reasoning to attack can be problematic and often seen to have to come up with some other reasoning in higher light and other places. There was a realization upon this in which is changing the way some are viewing certain things and especially upon certain anti-camp changes should be understood for what it is. <br>Life upon viewing content and reading histories being nurturing to certain beings in regards to oneself.<br>- The idea to pick one day a month where I would work towards creating things in regards to certain kind especially those in which I am seemingly leaving behind when I am really still close by. Like I said heaven is around us and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me to hear that there are those of higher light interacting with a great many of us. <br>- A moment where I was watching certain content that I had a thought about utilization of desensitization and forced life as well as other kinds of working against in the present upon certain futures that has seen certain kind working against me in the present. Certain kind of streamlining then supposedly but they may be trying to say that had happened to have it have happen. So that sort of thing might not have taken place but the energy feng shui tells me otherwise in a certain context. I don&#39;t fully know how to describe it but it&#39;s like looking at a certain part of the show and wondering if that part had anything to do with you and that desensitization and shoehorning out of the room by way of being too famous, like you have too much to do with not just this show but a lot of the shows. Whatever causes that to be said to be truth, is that kind of stuff happening to me and others that my Main Spriit Guides indicated?<br>#VoiceAttatchments #MyVoice #Help<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
