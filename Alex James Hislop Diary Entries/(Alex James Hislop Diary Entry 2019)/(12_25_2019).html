Dec 26, 2019, 8:37:57 PM</div>
<div class="title">(12/25/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Channeling, Psychictivity, Movement, Tactic, <br>- I think there was certain things that took place in which has been reliant in regards to certain excuses pertaining to event relaying and story depiction within certain machinisms. Like seeing story depiction and event relaying within the setting itself and in this instance it was in regards to the wood grains on my wall in which upon me viewing them was supposedly a catalyst for certain things. Regardless the turbulence on either end I am not certain is warranted in a certain manner and I don&#39;t think that amount of attacks that have been insinuated is clouth or even the reasoning relayed pertaining to story and event relaying as well also other kinds. In fact i think there was other dimensional in regards to this day especially early morning. It initially supposedly started with a content experience but again I don&#39;t know if that is the problematic. Followed by multiple conversations in my kitchen in a rundown pertaining to how it got to be the way it did in my process. Then there was talk of other-dimensional and psychictivity. There was a large live heightened energies and it might have been that tell where there certain things going on elsewhere rather than on my end except that there multiple attacks and spiritual turbulence discerned on my end as well. There was moments where they utilized certain kind of other dimensional stimuli supposedly similar to Bermuda Triangle stuff in other dimensional around me but I think some of it is fiction depiction. I defended myself with a certain kind of shield. I felt spirit utilizing certain kinds of doors in regards to myself and then also bigger doors in what I discerned to be life itself upon a though I had. Multiple kinds of energies discerned in regards to battle ensued. There was defenders and protectors as well as saviors. A certain other-dimensional suction moved over my head area and body in which maneuvered other dimensional in regards to my being and what I can discern at times. Creating Christmas Disclaimers can&#39;t be the reasonings for some of this turbulence and neither can other kinds of information placement in regards to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated as their already are multiple kinds of Earth-Based informational Placement and other kinds created in which is for some a normality. Light display the statistics where my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the moments that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Really Shitty Christmas on my end. <br><br>- Utilization of how I approach punishment and crime as an excuse to attack me and the leniency and quality of life I advocate in regards to punishment. The excuse to do good in regards to this planet and others upon some of the turbulence and attack in regards to myself and others that my Main Spriit Guides indicated and vice versa.The kinds of attachments and utilization of actions, non-actions especially experiencing content experiences, relaying of events and story depiction as well as other kinds as an excuse as to why to attack. Fame utilization and reasonings for certain spiritual attack as well. Certain dimensional that shouldn&#39;t be attacked anyhow in regards to our content experiences and the fixing up of that dimensional upon certain attack because of said attacks instead of fixing the problem outright. Utilization of Earth-Based and then some of the extremes in regards to the utilization of my own content. Certain spirit combining with me and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) after attacks and<br>The continued attacking myself in regards to the things that have happened in outside world, where one person who hasn&#39;t done anything wrong gets attacked in a fashion and some claiming because of what I have done deserving more attack when I am in my right in creating informational placement. The continued sizing up of attacks in regards to myself and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides). The continued pretending to be good but not in regards to some. The continued utilization of myself in regards to attacks and traps as well as switching overs. Stuff like saying that if I don&#39;t write a Diary entry that my Interaction doesn&#39;t change to be decent when that hasn&#39;t been fully agreed upon at times by my Main Spriit Guides. The Casework in regards to my Main Spirit Guides in regards to my life. The Spiritual that happened behind the scenes in regards to December 24th, 2019 and December 25th, 2019 in regards to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The continued pulling of the rug of some in the past in regards to this life and the impact on the present as well as the free passes in the past in regards to this life and the impact in the present. The ignoring of certain future and facilitation of band aides upon time frames where certain aspects were suppose to change, while there has been changes in this process in regards to safety there have also been moments w here it was supposed to be changed a certain way. The utilization of resources that were supposed to go to me bu rather utilized elsewhere and the utilization of resources here that was supposed to be utilized elsewhere, while still having decent greed coverage plans as well for a decent sized portion. The forming up through me, combining and harming my life by way of combining, mixing it up with those sanctioned to be combined and then the trying of forming up through me in higher light. The utilization of my life outside earth-based. What my perspectives and God sparks, as well as other kinds in regards to myself are going through regardless of the amount decent experiences in which has been given at times to counteract some of the bad but utilized to continue some of the bad experiences. Combining me with certain kind that have had disparities to try and fix their lives while I am still getting attacked at times. The realization that my higher light self went through some of the experiences that I had been through and more so but also the tetherment to me to the certain experiences behind the scenes sometimes claimed not to be my Higher God Spark in which my Higher God Spark is experiencing a portion of by was of what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The continued utilization of myself in regards to getting other spirits in which then is blamed on myself in certain key moments in which has lead to certain attacks. Some of the things tried to be tethered in regards to my life and the lives of my family as well as others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated especially in regards to story as well as the stealing of storylines in regards to my life and the lives of my family as well as others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides). The The fact that I didn&#39;t really do anything wrong this day in which you can look at the paragraph before this in which supposedly lead to some of the events that would take place and the turbulence, harm and medical observations in which is listed already on written Diary Entry form. The continued blaming on other-dimensional and continued let knows that somehow I am supposed to take the hit in which there is a decent sized portion of lies in the mix. <br><br>Multiple medical observation, right breast dimensional infrastructure cut, pain discerned regarding. Head area attacked. Suction tube put over my head area and body. Movement of other dimensional in which was supposedly good in that instance. Attacks in regards to allpersonal. Invoking of cold and strep throat and bronchitis in other-dimensional pertaining to myself in which I can feel a portion of but a certain spirit can feel the more of behind the scenes, the section off of myself and attacks regarding. The insinuations of rape and attack in regards to other dimensional infrastructure. Other dimensional Lungs affected, wrapped in something and felt like it sunk. Chakras affected, multiple cores removed, love core removed from chest area and a certain kinds of cores in regards to head area and feet area removed. The decent in regards to some of this has been that healing teams have been helping me in extreme ways at times. Yesterday it felt like I was hooked up to an oxygen hoze zipline on my head area.There is a stimuli I have discerned in regards to opening of doors of self. Like someone walking through certain areas of my body. Multiple traversing in some of these areas in which I feel to be sacred in which I discerned a certain group located there in which defended themselves.<br><br>There would be other kinds later on in the night as well, Aspect of God and spiritual changes in regards to certain aspects of Earth said to have happen. It was also said that I wasn&#39;t the only one affected early morning 25th of December 2019.</div>
