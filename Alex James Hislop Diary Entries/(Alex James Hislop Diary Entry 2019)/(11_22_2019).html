<div class="title">(11/22/2019)</div>
<div class="content">I woke up sad this day, I am not certain if something happened in the spirit or if it something else to be true. There was a sadness in the air and it felt genuine. The events yesterday though kind of felt like some spirit were fighting and that I was in the mix somehow. I don&#39;t know if something changed or what the events were but I felt confident yesterday that I was being defended but again multiple spirit channeling through and letting know that there was certain kind attacking me and one of the topics of discussion had to do with the fact that I shouldn&#39;t and don&#39;t have to say for certain kind to defend myself. There was also something yesterday about being present, interestingly enough that I felt present in a certain manner but also I realized removed later on from a certain kind. Being moved away and certain energy placement leading me not to interact with a more brimstone kind to be true in which seemed to be in conflict with others that operated a certain way, in which made it seem like certain brimstone spirit might have been the good guys in the situation but I am not certain and the more moral kind that was supposedly in conflict might be the good guys as well. <br>- There was a dream I remembered again this day, it reminded of the green land rover that my Aunt used to drive and we were up at the cottage or somewhere similar. it was said to be about some kind leaving. I don&#39;t what this memory was about but I think there should clarifications about this dream. A certain kind leaving in which was here before, almost a discernment of future supposedly causing them to leave but I think some stayed. It might have been the energies I felt and the insinuations the spirit around me invoked but I felt maybe it was a fox and the hound moment, where the last drives the fox into the wilderness, let&#39;s him go to protect him. In the dream that I remember having years ago it seemed real and there was this air about some that did not want me to remember. <br>- I played multiple gaming sessions this past couple days, today it&#39;s my birthday, I am taking the day off and just chilling, I am here and have been doing verbal advocations and a couple of other things, might do a soothsaying video. There was a spirit around me invoking energies of contentment upon playing video games and it&#39;s one of those things we notice within life to be true and don&#39;t fully identify noticing those energies for what they are. Like noticing the difference between different thought mechanisms, speaking in your mind, doing a math problem and having a thought in the head area about commenting about a situation.<br>- There has been something going on with my psychictivty, certain kinds of spirit I feel are trying to modify my psychictiviy which I find to be offensive in a certain manner. I want it to reflect what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Some have tried to maneuver certain kinds of energies having to do with feeling like communications are open as well as that heaven is close by but it seems to be backfiring at times with the mentality presented in that communication is open regardless and heaven is close by either way. It matters though. <br>AJh Radio free Earth, defending yourself and supposedly losing defense upon such an endeavour. The taking away of things and hookups, mixing up the right to be able to have energy utilization regarding and saying that we can no longer defend. Getting ass backwards wrong and piece mealing it together later on, feng shuing life to look a certain way in how it didn&#39;t play out supposedly to save a certain kind in the end in which for some defenders if they could and weren&#39;t put in such difficult situations to defend a certain kind would have given context. I am still here, I have been here, I have done advocations daily, I have talked about defense throughout the deal it&#39;s just not in certain areas anymore which is a part of the it but maybe it is more so than some thought. How many process alternatives in regards to this place and how many are in those areas.<br><br>Idea:<br>those that are riffing from my actions especially physicals <br>those I am riffing from their actions especially physicals<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.

Clickable links like the show all actions on the Peacekeeperalex trello account and attachments section where upon me clicking links shows up on my screen has been at times shoehorned into a spot where some in the spirit think that it needs to be shown in order for it to work.
