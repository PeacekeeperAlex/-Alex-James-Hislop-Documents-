<div class="title">(09/15/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I discerned a certain group by way of seeing form via psychic discernment. It&#39;s one of ways I have been able identify certain spirit in multiple capacities I believe. This group reminds me of sand. I have noticed multiple human potentially shaped in certain ways in which remind me of this group and potentially specific Banners regarding, although in regards to some of them there might not be any relation. At first it was thought that some of them come from a certain kind of working mentality but I also got the vibes that some are of recreational. <br>- Another thing spoken of these days was miracles and Miracle culture, I discerned there to be discussions about such phenomenon in regards to physicals and other-dimensionals pertaining to earth based spoken of. Other events might have taken place as well. <br>- Another kind spoken of this day has been in regards to Cystic Fibrosis especially someone that reminded me of love. I felt today in regards to my lungs other dimensionally fill up with fluids and I think some had to employ certain technology to save certain kind behind regarding. <br>- Proof I have seen in this life pertaining to some of the darker aspect in which I don&#39;t want my other-dimensional selves and allpersonal bearing the burden especially when labelled in regards to them and not me upon some not being able to blame me in certain capacities. I pass on and go to a high up place not only because of the circumstances of my life but also because physical drivers, those moving the physical body physically go to high up place but what of the allpersonal and other selves especially those reliant of the physical life, they should have to end up in areas where they have to explain my life especially upon some of the disparities that exist. We know there are going to be some that are take things out of context, I don&#39;t want sitting up there watching them get harmed while some bureaucrat sits there and tells me that I can&#39;t intervene and that if do I will be harmed. I know there are exceptions, I see miracles on this planet daily saving physicals even in contexts that some physical don&#39;t know about. Miraculous disease recoveries and angelic intervention. I know there is such a thing for when some pass on, exceptions in regards to certain metamorphosis that is suppose to take place upon certain physical humans passing on. Heck, I am of the wavelength that some pertaining to my life utilization, the idea that there are spirit that utilize ones life to potentially help but also not so in certain dimensional areas where some of us are no longer able, allowed or willing to do, specifically some of bad spirit shouldn&#39;t have to hold it down in certain life as per what might take place. It&#39;s a part of similar issues. It&#39;s not just understanding that there is exceptions and saving in regards to passing on but also understanding that instantaneous transportation machinisms exist. We know it to be.<br>- The amount of things done by those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light similar to what I have labelled Sunset Grills and Sunrise Grills. <br>- One of the things I have discerned is certain kind trying to have it be said that some of things that have happened on the side of content creation pertaining to my life as Alex James Hislop and Others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) were actually on my end in regards to how I experience psychictivty. One of the things I have noticed is e impact that we have on the films and music that is created as well as other kinds of content creation. There ave been moments where I have felt spotlight and spirit looking at me and that upon my actions literally sensing spirit moving from one process to other processes, for example, I have walked to my living with this spiritual spotlight on me and turned on the news in which I have noted in regards to live coverage to be affected at times by way of certain spirits maneuvering to that area. There were some that have been trying to affect and feng shui energies in regards to certain reflections of movie scenes to lend credence that it might be on my end pertaining to what I am discerning. <br>- This 4 or 5 second latency in regards to live media coverage is probably noted in regards to some of the reactions i have gauged upon my actions in regards to what I am viewing which speaks of certain spirit being told of what would happen beforehand and also some spirit setting a certain interaction upon what is playing out on the news 4 or 5 seconds previous to my action in which supposedly impacted what I was viewing. Again when I speak of affecting content experiences that were created 10 or 15 years previous especially in regards to film, I would have a thought or say something while watching a movie and the expression and interaction upon the scene I am watching would reflect something similar to what the thought or saying was about, in which some take a look at and felt there is an incredulity and fantastic as well as dubiousness that the kind of interaction that I and others that my Main Spirit Guides would have impacted past content recorded years previous. When it&#39;s spoken of in regards to live content though and spirits moving from one process to the next in regards to certain people watching news content and live coverage there is said to be from some more credibility because of how some view time. The latency in regards to live coverage though is what sticks out and lend credence to past content experiences, if I have a though while watching news and the what is being depicted on screen is spot on in regards to what I was thinking about then how was that facilitated with the kind of 5 to 10 second latency that exists. <br>- Another thing that I have noticed is on other ends pertaining to certain content in regards to communications within this process and other kinds especially in regards to live coverage in that it&#39;s not always on my end upon my interaction but also upon others within certain processes in regards to that content. It&#39;s usually thought that I am the one impacting communication and interaction at times upon my actions even though we have understood that sometimes it&#39;s spirit utilizing my process and others in which invoked interaction and not necessarily myself and others, but that&#39;s also some spirit within other processes related and depicted on screen and within content. <br>- A capacity created in regards to when I advocate for certain spirits to be protected. The idea is that there is a threshold for certain kind in which created in regards to my advocations especially to be utilized the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated upon doing certain advocations in regards to Bad Spirit.<br>- Certain spirit have also been doing certain interaction and saying I have been making a bigger impact but not in the ways to potentially facilitate that impact for what&#39;s acceptable. More of a showing that I am impacting things in which was discerned and has been emphasized to not be what some think it is but in the mix I think some spirit have been gauging certain impact from my process and ripple affect. Yesterday there was a moment when I compared myself to an Original Light being and the amount of power comparison which I insinuated I would have no chance partially by way of being at the spirits mercy around myself to a certain degree. <br>- Near the end of the day there was interesting interaction happening with one of the content experiences coming out soon in which the depiction of Joker looks really cool. The kind of stuff that happen upon watching movies around my processes is interesting on that I will see forms of the actors depicted at times in which can be theatrical at times but is often in a certain manner in which denotes other kinds kinds interaction that has been both thought to be related to life utilization in which is not always the case. It&#39;s been a bit of a topic point for a bit now on my end, months and years in which really speaks of the pent up agression at times from certain Spirit in regards to it not being said at times in the physical and other places, it can set tone and spark interest as well as shudder doors and windows to hear it once again for the fiteenth hundred thousandth time. Not enough though or too much. Some speak of conversation to flow blood but others to get to the door of a finished conversation on a certain topic can be dangerous specifically if a certain kind of fin is in order. <br>- I can feel my process lured by the theatrical and the road of art. I think it&#39;s a great idea to be true, why can&#39;t we be who we want to be? Given the correct access and outlets as well as alternatives and leeway we could. Is it viable? Should it be viable? There was a moment on the 13th where I emphasized that I wanted to be happy and to proceed with my process in a certain manner to be true I thought of dividing lines, those that didn&#39;t feel a certain way as per what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light, leave this process and the processes that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Some say that oh but the ripple effect and I would point towards my Main Spirit Guides information regarding and besides some of these spirits came from somewhere and my informational placement only pertains to what my Main Spriti Guides indicated an act not so uncommon in the spirit realm specifically in some of the context that I have created. Either way some of the spirits traversed supposedly because of myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated but not really because of my physical informational placement. Not truly for what&#39;s acceptable. Either way I think they should leave this process on the grounds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and some of them don&#39;t even really be here anyhow to be true. It makes one believe in super groups emerging to protect the physical, almost. Considering we don&#39;t even get physical God&#39;s in the Physical on this planet and a seemingly captive circumstance behind the scenes spiritually in which doesn&#39;t just extend to some of our other-dimrndoonal selves at times but also others as well in a certain context which makes it seem outlandish. Especially for those working against me to be true but also other kinds that don&#39;t have much to do with it if any at all. Either way I feel we should be able or have a theatrical process and ways that we want around ourselves while still being able to kick out the seemingly captors that seemingly Chain us. I want to say may on the prison storyline as well cause I am kind of sick of being the warden at times. The wardens laughs cause it was never me so said anyhow but maybe he is getting their as well. Spiritual atmospherics matter and life matters as well, what we experience soiritual may just be as important as what we experience in the live not to say it can&#39;t be spiritual. <br><br>Advocationals:<br>Advocations for Old people and spirit pertaining to September 2019<br>Interaction Advocations pertaining to content experience interactions.<br>Those Guardians of Youth that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>Those falsely accused of crimes especially pedophilia.<br>Safeguards in regards to the Innocent. <br>Entertainment in regards to my Process and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
