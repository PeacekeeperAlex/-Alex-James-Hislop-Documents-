<div class="title">(11/29/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Mood: Quiet, Reserved and Focused.<br><br>Activity:<br>The ripple Effect regarding our lives can matter. There is a spirit that likes that I sometimes say that it doesn&#39;t have to matter. I am wondering at what point that sentiment became all important or vital. It might contrast and correlate with another kind that seemingly gave up or had enough. There is a portion that stopped doing a certain Duty in a certain manner but I feel that there are aspects of that spirit in operation just not in the ways that we once knew. Saving. It seems to have always have been about quality of life and safety. It&#39;s a bit of a redundancy to speak of safety upon quality of life as it is a given but again it laments upon what I am getting at in a certain manner. The truth is that there is a large portion of ripple effect in which really does matter. The though we have and emotions, energies that we create and our actions and non-actions in which ripple like in a pond but imagine there being billions of ponds, imagine that each spirit has a pond in which can have multiple kinds of ponds within. For so much impact that we have on each others lives I am wondering if that Big Pond in regards to ourselves has felt the tiny ripple and huge splashes we seemingly create when incarnate. No doubt there seems to be a safeguard in the mix in which protect that big pond from being too disturbed. It&#39;s this same group talked about that walked away from whatever it was long ago supposedly, only to still be back in an unofficial capacity, some in which have for along time that seems to be taken for granted at times. Some might have guessed that I would just say that partially what I am talking about is the Spiritual turbulence and conflict that I have been able to discern at times in an elder kind walking away and that that big pond is sometimes in regards to elder God spark in regards to ourselves. The mentality that some might have me thinking about middle realm God Spark and that that is what the Big Pond is about and that might have to do with a certain amount coolness and awareness. The truth though as to what I am partially talking about speaks of that but also of what it used to be not necessarily in regards to safety because let&#39;s be honest, at times that changed and became less important almost as similar to how safety at one point in time became more important than hanging out or experiencing art, dancing and living. Maybe it&#39;s of a different time frame in the spirit and the wa it happened might have been more gradually but eventually a certain kind long longer ventured to the worlds that were changing and would change. Ar we angry that the elder kind no longer experienced the friendship that was once located in certain areas and the scariest part about this is that the dimensional area of what we call space might not have been in play when these events took place. 13 some odd billion years doesn&#39;t sound to be the correct number of years for how long this has been an issue but there are still those that understand and facilitate. Do we be more upset at the fact that the elves seemingly left of us not high and dry? Or maybe just that it looks that way on occasion? Maybe if it was on occasion but I wouldn&#39;t go that route. It all became about what those that were being harmed were experiencing and when you look at the most important in existence as to why it&#39;s considered to be that maybe you start to see similar themes. It&#39;s an extension. Those that focus on what we are experiencing. Can you imagine a screen from god that is seeing most of what spirit are experiencing. and On this screen one day somebody experiences something negative, it&#39;s happened before in a certain sense but maybe a flash of what it would be in the future. From a handful of spirits experiencing negative and painful non consented to the billions upon trillions of spiritual experiencing that pain and suffering of whatever long never to be forgotten war that would eventually happen. It&#39;s a subliminal but maybe it was a reality check. The forgotten line of what we are experiencing and maybe a tell as to why it went that way was broken friendships. This tug of war of what is more important might not have anything to do with it to be true. It might have to do with the small things that changed. Like a party never happening again in official only to be usurped by the young that would carry the soul of such a thing. Elders smile once in a while on such a happening. Something that some of us down here wouldn&#39;t fully know about to be true but some would. The interaction and movement of being able to look below the threshold, make a journey downwards and not have to worry about stigma that would be created let alone the kinds of danger manifest that would exist down the road. Down and up, both good? What&#39;s good when we are all good where the ethical boundaries were not really a problem and such words were less focused because it was natural. We focused on fun and happiness, learning, adventure and discovery. Ethical alignment was probably less of a thing but more importantly we were more connected and we cared about each other, we interacted in positive way and that portion that seems to be the small of it might actually be the big of it especially when we speak about mending. The fact that there are those who have never spoken to each other in centuries and eons of time.<br>How de we reconcile and what exactly was the impact of certain kind no longer visiting below certain thresholds. Are we in a cycle for some in which we are trying to break free and what is the correlation of lost time together, lost moments and never again that limited are ability to get along and even be together. Are we being mended in that way? I think the answer is that we are and in fact it&#39;s probably been said as an excuse in regards to certain kind as a at least there is that or an excuse and reasoning as to certain things but not as an antagonistic, no? Because when it over boils it looks to be not sewing us together at times but breaking us apart. The peripherals of all of this is what some fin interesting and can see the themes and web that lends towards the integral knowledge and understanding that can save a kind, enlighten a culture and change a direction. God forbid we talk about what needs to be talked about but I still feel the sight of such things be worthy of discussion. What exactly is this all about? Self exists. In Multiple kinds of ways. Events take place where friendships are lost and ways of life altered. Lost in the shuffle are the small details and the interaction from some in which did have an impact and focus seemingly put fourth upon those that are experiencing negative and suffering. Imagine a certain kind of famous that use to travel to Earth no longer comes here anymore and it wasn&#39;t just about the fame but also the familiarity. Times passes and the Familiarity is supposedly lost but a Spirit creates something. In which ever that famous wanted to come back again that there is those moments in which existed potentially as if that kind continued to visit earth where relationships could continue if need be as if it never happened or at least least that there is moments in which doesn&#39;t have to lend to alienation. But when did such machinisms be turned against and utilized in negative fashion. Maybe this whole discussion at times has partially been about thresholds and what exactly it looks like while existing in certain thresholds. Like the darker point of view that lies at the bottom of the dimensional existences. Maybe it&#39;s about Light point of view that lies at the top. Which has been suppressed more I supposed depends on the area on is located. <br>How does this fit into immorality culture especially when it&#39;s difficult to survive at times. A moment of importance upon such other kinds that can seem to be washed away in the mindset of it all. Is a kind supposed to give a shit about some of the friendships that existed long ago especially when some of them seem to not give a fart about said culture at least in how they are portrayed and viewed. The lies and saves begotten it wrong? How are some suppose to care when care is on the menu? When some don&#39;t even remember what care is?  When it&#39;s not even understood who some of those elders are and what they represent and how can we even confront such a truth when it&#39;s supposedly keeping things straight in some of those societies. Tough questions to be true and some wouldn&#39;t think so but maybe that&#39;s the point. Maybe it does matter. Maybe working through that stuff is suppose to happen and maybe it&#39;s a better alternative. A better alternative to what? I guess one of the key questions in all of this is what exact have some of these elder kinds and youngers that have turned their back on us or never took it upon themselves given ways of life and experiences that supposedly happened done for us? Should understanding win the day in knowing the finer points of it all? <br><br>Information Placement:<br>Alex James Hislop and Others(defined by my Main Camp) Interaction (Uploaded on the PeacekeeperAlex Github Account) <br><br>Themes: <br>#Elders #God-Realization #Love #Truth #Time #Importance #Schedule #Events #DiaryEntries #Boards #Conflict #Vindication #Excuses #Blame #SickOfIt #ThinkOfItInRegardsToYourself #Blatant #Spiritualism #<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
