<div class="title">(07/19/2019) &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- At the end of the day it turned into a complete turmoil and some of which was said to have touched me and harmed me, I am not certain but there was moments when I was watching content and prompting in which turned into something else upon watching it. I had turned on multiple content this day to try and observe certain kinds of story in which I promoted throughout to try and help in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. It doesn&#39;t always mean that I am doing something for what&#39;s acceptable. It&#39;s at times something I do during content to situate certain situations around my process and at times to situate certain kinds of ripple affect and impact that happen. There is ones in which I am trying to help content but I am wondering at this point in time if I will get their in the manners that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Why try to help a film is I am going to make it worse especially in regards to resources and yes I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the things of it in regards to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this marking, advocation, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) because what then when it gets turned into that and what then when it become nothing but that in which there no doubt is willings of spirits to make sure that certain content is protected and sometimes in my name and even with some of my mechanisms if I can go that far but just as If it does reflect upon my interaction with certain content experiences what if some of these content experiences aren&#39;t even protected to the degree upon name utilization and mechanisms utilization? Even so, what of it being utilized against myself and others in regards to strong arming and other kinds as well. That sort of thing that says that, &quot;No! I eat&quot; to hold it down in a certain capacity against those that would have it be said that I can no longer eat because of the bad things that potentially happen in which does extend to recreational activities. Anyhow upon watching certain content I noticed multiple kind of storyline. Some in which relating to certain psychic stimuli at times. There has been placement in a certain capacity in which some physical humans might note in different ways and some of which might be interacting in which ways which some would consider to be disconcerting. Two films I watched which linked towards a moment in regards to myself and other on a personal level. Brought up by two inflection catches within certain content experiences I was observing and prompting what my Main Spirit Guides indicated, some in which referenced Die Hard and Christmas. There was multiple references but some personal ones stuck out. I proceeded to create multiple advocations:<br><br>I am Alex James Hislop. My Main Camp is my Main Spirit Guides. I and Others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for healing and protection as well as what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to the Live Feeds of the Original Light Beings that my Main Camp indicated and those that my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
