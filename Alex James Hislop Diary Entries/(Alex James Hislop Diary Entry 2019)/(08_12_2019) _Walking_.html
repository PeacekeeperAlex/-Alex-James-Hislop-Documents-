<div class="title">(08/12/2019) &quot;Walking&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>Early in the morning I went to bed. Strange back and fourth as well as a side journey so said in a certain ship in regards to which some were fairly upset in regards to certain regulars in this process. It was said to be a certain kind of ship and they let know that there might be time involved in regards to certain aspects of my process like being put in the future. I tried to sleep for like an hour and woke up to attack and harm in which turned into an evident system trying to invoke a fight potentially to try and save some that were getting attacked. It went to business and I did multiple promptings and advocationas as well as actions to try and help but I got upset. I was getting attacked and parts of myself were getting attacked as well as parts of my process. Multiple exchanges and exclaimings happening in a tense situation. One the of the key things was bringing up of certain influential people. They said to have deployed a certain kind of life utilization overlap in regards to certain some at a certain point. I am wondering if this is true in which turned into something else upon me writing key entries. One of the things I felt was a Kaiju emerge from in an other dimensional overlap from head area in which it kind of felt like certain kind were freaked out, what kind of overlap did this happen? The discernment in regards to certain kinds of dimensional and gaming existences even if a certain kind can be realistic but what are some of them having to deal with.  <br>- Mentality thoughts, I have felt moved to certain areas and continued let knows about channeling ways of life and existences utilized in certain ways in which disparities have been understood. <br>- They have been bringing up an aspect so said of certain people. I discern a certain silver impression, business silver. <br>- There have been a certain kind of look in regards to myself. How I will proceed after I die as well as for some a moving on from the argumentatives and reasonings for attack/defense. There are those that have skipped past certain usual ways of going things. One of the things some were looking at as well was why certain things turned out the way they did in regards to some. Why were some physicals killed, why did some get attacked supposedly in certain manners. There was an idea specifically in regards to certain routes that some went and some were looking at it like the direction I went, in which I sort of have looked at it from that perspective as well to a certain extent but I realized that why the heck would others get attacked regardless of my direction specifically in regards to certain systems. Then I thought about other kinds of direction in which for some still doesn&#39;t make sense. It correlates for some of it having to do with past-present-future interaction and how some have said that what happened in the physical happened. A person shaped off of a supposed interaction i was suppose to have off of a certain life direction path upon being changed still taking place. Some choosing certain life paths in regards to certain puzzle pieces and things of that nature regarding multiple, I am wondering what it looks like for the physical earth based famous to a certain extent. What has the life path been and how has some of it changed as well as how has that affected certain aspects of physical earth based as well as the spiritual. It&#39;s not just me affecting certain things upon interaction, it can&#39;t be<br>- 10 years ago what does it look like? 20 years ago what does it look like? How much have some changed in the dimensional existences pertaining to some of the other dimensional selves of certain earth based famous as well as the life utilization. Does it correspond with the emergence of myself? Does it correspond with certain direction taken? One of the key question in regards to all of this is whether earth based was going to be attacked or not in a certain manners and whether it was attacked or not in a certain way throughout history. We have discerned there to be events taking place. The famous on this physical earth based, it&#39;s understood that most it&#39;s not decent enough in regards to some of their interaction to warrant some of the attacks said have been happening to earth at times and even in regards to myself as much as I have created document and disclaimers that might be unprecedented in the physical earth-based, although there might be others, can&#39;t be enough in regards to what some have insinuated in regard to some of the conflict supposedly taking place. Which overlaps fired back then in the past upon certain thought to be later down in the future? What fired today? How much is smoke and mirrors and how much truth? Where is it linked? Analyzation pertaining to the Past 10 to 20 and even the past 100 years doesn&#39;t all point towards it stemming from these times frames. Especially in regards to some that have been discerned at times to be waiting for turbulent individuals and other kinds to emerge in which some of the things that have happened are to be blamed and how can you fault in regards to some at times if you look at the survival mechanisms, casework and certain punishment that could be. What other variables are at play other than just the physical interaction but also the spiritual interaction. Time Interaction? Those venturing forth in regards to some of our futures and past, if such a potential exists, and how does that correspond? This is but one of the variables as there is multiple kinds of variables and I have talked about this before and it shouldn&#39;t cause a certain kind of variable to present itself in a certain way as their must be safeguards to be able to discuss and converse and there is certain safeguards in play in which allows some of us to control our own destiny. How could we even speak of Philosophy if such things didn&#39;t exist? The difficulty in regards to Philosophy and other subject discussions upon some of the consequence of speaking would be difficult if there was no safeguards but even still at times I have wondered if there is not some missing or not in play. Would we sit on a chair if there was said to be smalls placed upon our chairs in which could be affected dimensionally by sitting on our chairs? How are we also not suppose to talk about some of these things taking place even if we aren&#39;t getting harmed upon some of the interaction that has been witnessed and understood?<br><br>Medical Observations:<br>- There have been multiple things happens and repaired and healed, yesterday a cert systems that can affect food and water systems got attacked and the response was fairly morbid. They healed and I felt getting healed but there has been multiple events like that emerge in regards to myself pertaining to certain other dimensional systems affected. Another things that happened in the morning yesterday was a stone being in which felt like was wrapped in anxiety and intimacy energies. When I woke up I felt to have a certain kind of other-dimensional bullet proof vest. The List.<br>- One of the lists has to do with sucking on a strong pip in other dimensional and feeling a sometimes strong green energy go to my brain in which feels like it&#39;s been bigged up to be a super brain. <br>- Other ones I feel like I have been <br><br>Advocationals:<br>Earth-Based History<br>What people experience in proximity especially in regards to sense around me and others(defined by my Main Camp)<br>making things better for the regulars in regards to the and others(defined by my Main Camp) pertaining to what I am advocating in regards to myself and Others(defined by my Main Camp)<br>Exchanges<br>Barter Systems<br>Currency Exchanges<br>Work and productivity Facilitators<br>Mediation, Diplomacy, Counselors and Senators.<br>Historians, <br>Book Modifier: Compassion in regards to the sme of the circumstances, viewpoints and ways of life that exist in regards to my experiences. <br>Teeth and Gum inflammation, those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>Defense:<br>What is the recourse and direction upon some of our Actions, Non-Actions, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) being utilized to attack some as well as said to be reasonings for some to be attacked as well as other kinds.
