<div class="title">(11/25/2019) &quot;Those before and after&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>How do I talk about the moments of God within my process? This early morning just 13 minutes past twelve has felt to be energetically like a spiritual event is taking place. I had went to the Original Creator and God to utilize certain systems earlier upon a placement of wanting to help but was within the context of doing battle to be true. The better advocations I did might have been about certain kind gaining access to certain systems to save right now but either way it segwayed to a moment in which was already chalked with earth-based realism, space and God culture with multiple kinds in between upon viewing my latest AJH Radio Earth Broadcast, I had done faith energy placements like faithing with head area mechanisms to create energy in which hangs over certain areas to give rejuvenation and other kinds of energies. Something changed somewhere and somehow, like a veil was lifted. How can I explain at times without resorting to the truth of the matter in some of the scary and terrifying insinuated at times in regards to those spirit that have been threatening this process. That not everything I have been doing has been about defense and yet I still seemed to be doing defensive actions upon some being present in this process partially to let know of situations but also other ones potentially doing harm. It had been partially why I had felt like doing battle probably, intermingled with past events and maybe future events as well in which not have been the true motivation but rather like the Angel from Micheal feeling a certain kind of combat felt correct. I wonder if I could masked it as well as he, like how he put sugar on his cereal, it might be out of place but considering certain culture it might be just right at home. They keep insinuating, certain spirit that channel through and insinuations, sometimes in the mind on occasion but rather the real culprit I feel is the energies I feel at times like something is happening in the spirit, about me and not really. Thank god it wasn&#39;t? How dare they? with all of the saving going on and the kind that pretend to be me saving especially upon my own lot and how this life is shaping out to be, I find myself wondering what the true answer would be. Not just whether I would find it acceptable, understandable in regards to the events behind the scenes, not only in regards to the bad things subtle spiritual insinuated behind my back but also of what exactly its was that took place. Because every other day? No, because every other hour it seems to be something happening in which would be the fist shaking of the Chroniclers and the Media to not be written down.  Maybe it&#39;s an exaggeration. Maybe life is an exaggeration, but gosh darn if you don&#39;t shit your pants instead of somebody getting harmed. That&#39;s what a certain spirit and culture would say. They speak sometimes in wild antics and boring treadmills if somebody would ever give an alternative. I mean from some perspective they wonder about the the literal idea for some that we have a group of spirits willing to do some jackass antics and it&#39;s a goddamn treadmill? every time? and don&#39;t mistaken for those that like the treadmill, Aint nothing wrong with that just keep the cocaine off the table. No one said anything about the other drugs though. This culture has to do with saving and at times for some trying to get some. How do you ask? Once upon hearing that immorality culture that are similar to my own on physical earth-based exist and in multiple kinds of fashions, there  were specifics that I started to understand that wasn&#39;t always about the darker brethren. This one has to do with a certain kind that does stuff to save people, imagine someone standing on a car driving 40 miles an hour down a large hill egging everybody on the side street. A certain darker kind might reward mercy depending on how many people that spirit on the car egged. There is an even darker kind that exists with even more extremes but I feel at times uncomfortable to fully speak of it. There are also certain kind willing to save at times depending on the antics. This is one look upon some of the things done to save people. Pursue intimacy publicly, go streaking in a public park and yell obscenities of the best kind at the police officers that make the arrest, diving with sharks might just be one of the best things you ever do as they are a popular kind, Strap a rocket to your back and try to launch yourself in the air for five seconds. You do these things in the spirit in certain places and you win the big ticket. You do these things in some of the normal areas and you can save, you can gain, you can win and there is a ton of side action for all those interested obviously given context. There is also a finer kind of this culture that exists that does speak of the sophisticates. They do things in a more enlightened manner that speaks of what yet again what the Spiritualist Communities are letting know of. Do you not think that aspects of our culture exist within heaven? It might be scary to think about if you pursue other thoughts that follow of the more darker kind that can exist but we have seen there to be let knows of the more immoral elements that exist at times through the writings of certain spiritualist on earth-based. Sometimes it can be small things too. Don&#39;t eat eggs on a certain day. Don&#39;t chew gum in a particular spot. Don&#39;t wear a song out to the point of no return. Sometimes it&#39;s about sacrifice, not the old school slaughter a goat to save the harvest,  no no, not these days for a certain kind, although there is some old Gods wondering, but to be true it can be about moderation. Don&#39;t have that second helping. Don&#39;t buy that new gadget today. Enjoy your life more. Speak clearly. Sit up straight. Meditate for shit sake. All some of us have ever known it to be the action that looks it to be but there is a whole lot more going on than you think. Gods and Angels for some, maybe the comedic kind at times watching you as you go to school or work, maybe even placing a bet on how many steps it takes you to get there. Off track a bit I know but it&#39;s not always about antics, sometimes it&#39;s about culture. The real truth is that I have come to realize some of these things exist. That there is at times a certain kind of spirit in trouble that needs a help up and that there are those willing to stilt across the road while wearing a chicken suit to do it. In the Spirit. How cool is that! Some play video games all day to save a certain kind. Others go to work to support their family, boring I know but Heroic nobles exist in many forms. It&#39;s not just about saving, it&#39;s also a wide variety of other kinds that if entertaining can fit the mold but sometimes it&#39;s not even about that. Sometimes it&#39;s about being boring or eccentric maybe bold given the day. Why in gods name is their this traveling circus band in my living room playing banjo music on a Monday. Because I am not going to work like the regular person. The kinds of stuff that some of the other dimensional selves have been through has been what would seem a portion of what some would call to be the wild goose chase to be. This culture clashes with what it&#39;s really about to be true. I am of this kind more so than the one talked about previous in which says they want to not experience things they don&#39;t want to experience, they want to be who they want to be and they want to look the way they want to look. There are some that have looked at what the Truth has to say on some of the darker elements in which spoke to them that they will never compromise who they are for anything ever again. Ever. But Never is not a strong enough word for how some of them truly feel on a rainy day or even maybe even on a bright day for when they remember who they are and who the other might be it brings them to the question of worth. God exists within both cultures and probably has had a few conversations with himself both internally and externally about how he feels. It doesn&#39;t always win out and it shouldn&#39;t.  It&#39;s sometimes not about who looks the greatest and maybe not about who looks the worst, maybe it has to do with care, care about what people think, the exact opposite of what some speak of on this planet, which I agree with except when you lose the care there are some that feel that a spark of passion is lost and again contrast with those that say that spark of life is gained upon not giving a crap. Maybe they are both right. Why am I so afraid to do some of these antics to save with the spiritual spotlight that has been seen on this platform? I am not afraid, it&#39;s even worse to be true. Lazy, lack of motivation and not wanting to do the things in which others could have so easily done in my position. I am not boring but I might as well be and it&#39;s a compliment for some. I am glad I have a certain kind doing some of these in my name but I am truly afraid to even find out on occasion. Maybe not as much as they are afraid to look at what I consider to be. God if there was only a way to provide. Repent is what some say. That old school Religious God exists and I am wondering if he thought the slap on the hand for writing with the left hand was good move. But I have never been too much into that sort of style, not in my current life anyhow. I woke up after going to bed with writing some of this in an anticsville kind of day supposedly in which was actually a lot of different kinds of days. I saw again family members in flashes, they kept trying to insinuate that something bad happened this night and morning, again and I am not certain I believe it and I don&#39;t who is more angry at times, me for all of things that have happened upon those insinuation or those who thought something bad happened in them moments that didn&#39;t but another party might be more angry upon the family of those in which didn&#39;t get harmed from those insinuations, now those that are trying to let know, that&#39;s one thing you never know if a spirit in distress got saved from the let knows in which on my end hasn&#39;t been fully detailed but rather vague at times. It was talked about yesterday about whether those let knows are beneficial and some felt they weren&#39;t but I see the merit in that in which says that letting know of something that is happening, you know those moments where you get back and scream why didn&#39;t any say anything on what was happening? Yeah, there is krumb in the mix with the let knows being that we told you so live at the end of ones life upon finding out from immoral spirit letting know that they did try to help in a not really way. But there is also those that are innocent trying to let know of something and upon me doing advocations a decent percentage of the time it that does seem to potentially lends towards  a difference. Hopefully. The interaction has been proven to still be chalked full of goodness and enlightenment but even through the changes there still seems to be difficulties with let knows of positivity but not really. I remember getting told that I was getting attacked in higher light, one of the things I realized is that there is a potential in higher light for some to have to be dealing with turbulence but the greatest thing about some of the let knows about the spiritualist communities is that there higher light where peace and prosperity reigns. If it was a truth or is a truth pertaining to some having to deal with hihers kind, one of the key questions  was that of, what about the other higher spirit that are good a morale as well as powerful. Because the portrayal like it&#39;s just some immoral spirit shows up to do damage and wreck my day seems to not fit the bill as where I am going, but it also is a question for those that seemingly just let them through in an effort to save especially in a citizen capacity. The duty of the Citizen? What&#39;s crap about it is the storylines and life pertaining to the insinuation which blows the citizen doing it&#39;s civic doing out of the water to be true and would do more if it wasn&#39;t for the tactics of some to make it more difficult to operate in certain manners. Either to literally have to resort to something you don&#39;t truly believe in upon lethal tactics if that portrayal is truthful anyhow which leads me to my next point as to why and how in Higher Light and Higher dimensional existences is there always that thing in which points towards someone having to use lethal to defend oneself when there is a multitude of different kinds of defences that one can employ. One of the key points talking about is a certain kind being walked in on while watching some of the darker stuff that exists, i thought of it from my perspective if certain kind were watching some of the harmful stuff that potentially happened to me and I thought I would be upset but the depiction of what happened was that someone barged in on my end it looked like that&#39;s what I did, watched an immoral content experience in some spirits house upon barging in and kind of making myself at home but some were also saying that the spirit that were watching in house were also potentially of me in a certain sense, maybe. Then I thought of rehabilitation and compromise, a certain portion of God spark gets damaged from being overexposed to immorality and then you have to reconcile, you speak together and make compromise that that god spark does no more harm and gets access to safe content experiences and lives where they can pursue holodeck programs and dimensional existences just as good as the real thing and I thought of it that some being access to watch some of the immoral entertainment to be another alternative in which exists which from the context of healing god spark and alternatives can be decent but also context. The context of it all matters though, what exactly is the comfort and the degree of interaction. Where is it situated because it seems a big part of some of the problematic is that below certain thresholds there seems to be a lack of resources, understanding and attention to be true, almost a certain ind at times ignored and more grimy version of what it could be but not always in a good way. Where some of the alternatives are not working. What do those of the enlightended kind and goodness, morality, peace and prosperity say in regards to such observations. A moving upwards happened in my process and a certain ind going the way of vindicating myself in some of my experiences on this planet, it looked to be going the ways honesty even brought fourth of discussions that the light understands our intention. A lot of spirit coming around and this process changing, me moving upwards and spirit moving upwards. I can feel the energies, lighter, cleaner and a spirit or tunnel over me moving upwards, almost like an opening into some higher area up above me in which I am traversing with. They let know this was a certain kind of emergence, a reveal and that maybe the spirit of space was trying to help but I also feel it was others as well. It&#39;s surreal in explaining the kinds of energies right now. There was a partial discussion in which spurred it, I had an epiphany about the setting and how truth is reflected in how the Original Setting operates naturally. It seems that this might be from those energies I was feeling or maybe it created those energies to be around me. One of the discussions though was about that in which is the enlightened and is quite moral, it can scare certain kind and some still want to play violent video games. Earlier there was a really large throwing up information, in which I was a part of, that showed those of immorality defending those of morality and others, then there was information of morality defending those of immorality and others. It was thrown up in a certain way in which helped the situation i felt. Of course some spirit try to let know that there is some things that are happening regarding in which might not be kosher, we need be realistic in understanding what exactly happening to some of us in regards to our personal and the impact it has on the societal just as much as wee need to understand the societal impact on our personal. For some of us it&#39;s not just present but also past and future. This interaction would twist and turn but ultimately remain with me throughout the day. Subtle, soft and compassionate in which was then accompanied by a removal, albeit I have seen this before in multiple capacities, of certain kinds of behavior and personality, some in which might be considered flaws but flaws I still want to reside where my Main Spirit Guides indicated nonetheless. Continued let knows that a utilization of good energies had happened upon which I have seen happen before to somehow say that certain kind living good life must be affected when that couldn&#39;t be further from the case. <br><br><br>-(Dreams of Family, flashes and insinuations that some were attacked, a dream of defending myself with lethal tactics against a certain kind that would reveal to be good, it almost felt like I was experiencing this and prompting in my dream because of the dream state it did feel like I was sleep walking but for prompting. It&#39;s not new, we have seen tossing and turning with the head area searching while sleeping in which has reminded at times to be certain spirit influencing because there have moments where some have influence interaction to happen upon me sleeping. 2AM to a quarter to 11AM was my sleep time, give or take. Another pointing would be upon waking up and sensing that a certain kind was watching certain happenings pertaining to immoral entertainment, the darker stuff which I seemingly burst into the room)<br>- (Throwing up of information in regards to Good protecting bad and bad protecting good in which altered course alongside other kinds of actions. It brought more peoples together in a certain sense. Coupled with a channeled conversation and not so on my end in which spoke of many different things along side an energy emergence. Like a large light in the sky or an opening in which saw multiple kinds of spirit move upwards.)<br>- (moment of speaking about the light how it can read intention and also those who after me and before of similar to be protected)<br><br><br>Informational Placement :<br>(Most of this in the AJH Daily Defensives Board on the Peackeeperalex Trello Account)<br>Access that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and the Authorization that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, the Storyline Placements that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, in regards to the Events that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to November 19th, 2019 and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) (x319)<br>Topics and themes Safeguards (x319)<br>Earth-Based Nations safeguarding Earth-Based Nations citizens in different Earth-Based Nations (x319)<br>Those that have looked like me Physically and Spiritually.
