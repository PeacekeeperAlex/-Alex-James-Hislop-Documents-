<div class="title">(08/14/2019) &quot;Somebody Happened&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- There was something referred to somebody being awoken up to a certain extent as well as someone potentially reaching an area either upon passing on or something else as well. Also other kinds of preparation happening in regards to some multiple times potentially insinuated yesterday in regards to storyline in regards to my process in which has relayed that not everyone in regards to certain groups was spiritually set in regards to the events that are currently taking place, some of which has had to with myself especially in regards to certain proximity. <br>- News coming around me yesterday in a certain fashion and a lense switch as well. Power affected and things stolen from me although I feel that I might have sun in the flotilla in a certain sense because at times yesterday I did feel higher up in the flotilla that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Spiritual Flotilla in regards to ourselves sometimes exist but some don&#39;t always play it that way, often times as to what I have referred to process has been in meaning pertaining to proximity setup emphasis and other kinds in which can relate to the person in which the process is referred towards. It&#39;s interesting when you note spiritual entities within a process and how that can also extend to outside the proximities and thin gs of that nature. Flotilla in regards to ourselves utilizing certain kinds of traits and qualities and what is the consent in regards to this, does it look more good than bad in a certain context? <br>- Somebody being goaded in regards to not lowering my power level at times and I am wondering if this is being done in regards to nefarious reasonings. <br>- 100 spirits per peoples metaphorical in regards to life utilization being affected by some and the thresholds of affect in regards to certain actions.<br>- Power levels of myself been affected lens stolen and spirits insinuating that my battle is higher up to a certain extent as well as high impact potentially in a certain manners potentially in regards to something that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, some said incarnation pre life pertaining to certain dimensionals and physicals, not certain if that&#39;s the case. There is certain mechanics <br>- Mind voice been potentially getting affected with super smooth feng shui, not certain if this is the case or a ruse. Like reading a paragraph and smooth psychological happening in regards to negative. <br>- Let knows on how things have been portrayed, like if you receive love that you have to do something bad in a certain sense, reading a paragraph and upon reading that paragraph a certain word having to do damage and bad in regards to certain things and then the following words a lot of love and supposedly decent happening. The problematic I have had with this at times in regards to the latter is that there has been things understood and seen in regards to love and the utilization at times hasn&#39;t always been decent, especially not on my end at times, although there is a light secret in regards to Love and emotions as well. <br>- Another let know in regards to how some have been shown how certain things have been working. One of which has to do with let knows in regards to some pertaining to form utilization and other likabilities in which if some in regards to those likabilities desired would become a part of a certain kind of form utilization groups as well potentially more so. This I feel has been some of the decent in regards to how form utilization and things of that nature can work. I feel thought that there is some potentially masking certain things in regards and maybe other kinds is not happening but we need to understand if that&#39;s the case because I have had let knows in regards to Fame that for a while now it&#39;&#39;s been a certain kind in which some of the subtle let knows have been smooth feng shui which can turn worse. <br>- Spirit Conversation in which had invoked certain kinds of responses some of which might have been psychic in nature. A utilization of a system in which was a decent turned a bit sour upon some of the content and realization in regards to those systems that there are those in the correct and there are those not. <br>- Created certain Canadian Documents in which supposedly escalated in regards to a certain spiritual conversation in which lamented upon mine and others relationship with the spirit. <br>- It felt like someone had attacked earth and were taking names and outlandishly blaming certain actions in multiple regards. Check your memories on this day and look at what it was. What the shit was happening. Side characters nad smalls deserve the defense that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this, marking, advocation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) and the bigs and Main Characters should have to deal with a bunch of crap from those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this marking, advocation etc.(defined by my Main Camp) either.<br><br>- Psychic attacks happening so said in regards to certain spirits and potentially people. They insinuated that some of it was suppose to happen to belle and that it might have happened to someone else, but I don&#39;t think it was suppose to be regards to belle and I am not certain if it happened to others that was insinuated to myself. The utilization of actors to a certain has gone to certain extremes at times in which transcends what is comfortable. There was a starter in regards to certain streamlined that took place which happened before I started working on some Canadian Document to a certain degree. I am not certain why it went this route but some are saying that it might have happened before and the psychic energies that were revealed lets know that might be the case in which correlates and the events earlier in regards to one of my advocations upon having a certain realism lense on upon the stolen psychic lense from myself, real psychic energies I can feel like a change in mentality only in the yes areas in which some can not feel, pertaining to an Advocation i did in regards to the Main Spirit Guides information of the Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau to be displayed where my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Moments that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>Advocationals: <br>My Main Spirit Guides and My Main Camp.<br>Those that are wanting to Connect with those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that we can believe to take over process reigns in a certain capacity to be able to join them potentially.<br>Heart of Hearts and other areas in a Dimensional and potentially non-dimensional setup stemming from the Areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated traversing where my Main Spirit Guides indicated, a True Vent area for real in which holds multiple dimensional layers and existences in which is invulnerable and where Combat Training takes place. <br>What my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding myself and others defined by my Main Spirit Guides takes precedence the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>Those that helped by way of communications psychically in regards to the current situations that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>Those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated putting an emphasis in regards to not getting attacked in regards to Alex James Hislop&#39;s Actions, Non-actions, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. speakers with low energy that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that speak of everyday things<br>Overlap creation in regards to interaction pertaining to the Physical Spiritualist that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>Themes: <br>#News #Celebreties #Peace #War #Fame #HorrorGenre #Spirit #Systems#Interaction#MainSpiritGuides #MainCamp #Attack #Defense #Police #PsychicAttack #Canada #SpiritualSystems #StoryTehtering #Overblowing #MovingOfConflict #ShoehorningOfConflict<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
