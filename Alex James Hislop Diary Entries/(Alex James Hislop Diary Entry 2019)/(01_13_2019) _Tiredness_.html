<div class="title">(01/13/2019) &quot;Tiredness&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I woke up and I felt quite tired, I do remember a bit of dreams but for the most part I was a bit restless, and my tired had an ache that I have discerned at times, something potentially to do with sleep energies, lower chest energies,not classic emotion for myself but certain kind of energy bodies. It&#39;s also been insinuated that fighting had happened. I feel there was spirits who were saved yesterday before I went to bed, I had also noticed in the African Queen film the shark element behind the scenes, they talk about building a torpedo and Humphrey Bogart a eyes go a bit darker than usual and as a psychic I am able to discern that more closely but even so grabbing a clip of it would be a bad idea. Another idea of darkness is that of going to certain afterlife and certain facilitation not being able to have happen, of course there is that sort of thing from those who would want it to happen to set stuff up like that so it looks that way when it really does matter and there is places like that that can facilitate. Creation and dimensional support, we transfers without fully even being able to discern the .  nature would be protected. Another issue is and has continued to be that of setting comms and dimensions in regards to Alex James hislop the way his main spirit guides indicated. You don&#39;t like what I talk about? You talk about something in the privacy of your own and neighborhood and someone attacks you for it? There is a couple storylines as well in regards to aliens, white being standing up upon Bogart at times but also around myself and not around certain forms too. There was also talk of being able to be who we want to be in multiple kinds of directions. There was a lot know about story and realism and it felt like one of those rwbirth moments and pivots in regards to my process. I watched Arrival (2016) and it felt like there an intensity in the air about that film, almost a let know in regards to certain dimensional existences a call back to earlier I my process in regards to there powercul psychic beings, also a let know of gravity in certain places. I was said that in a certain dimension certain spirits started attacking me and that some were now seeing certain things. I think<br><br>Defense: <br>That sort of thing as to implementation of certain things sometimes said to the need of certain machinisms and sometimes not. That sort of thing to make it look like  I am winning certain things to the naffect end game sort of stuff potentially in a defensives sort of way. Also trying to get it so then spirits and being are relying on my advocations and also while certain defnesives are taken and put there to be taken at the same times to say that I affected the equilibrium and try and blame myself and others that my Main camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. I think I need to situate awareness in regards to myself and accept certain thing in regards to preparation and awareness and approach in kinder gentler hand. That sort of thing impacting future generations off of my multiple advocations in regards to a certain direction and let know in regards to those who come later and now by way of continuing to have to seemingly focus on getting my main camps information. The idea of myself impacting and diluting the ability to get psychic information through that sort of thing where idea are only given to one psychic and then limited in a certain way on the planet of sample size.<br><br>INFO: <br>Like we go to certain dimensions for some of use when we sleep, one of which is a visual place that we can discern called dreams. There are certain things within movie that if clip into a montage I can hit home in a couple different spots. Focusing on psychic research h in regards to film. Also the research within film to understand messages, we talk of life sign, and sign from the spirit. One of which has to do with literal messages within film. Some of which might be influenced and potentially taken out of context by the messages themselves but others might be let knows. The idea that a message could create upon the let know and perception, which can be difficult especially if it&#39;s a warning upon which creates that in which it is warning of to begin with. <br><br>Idea: <br>Lottery Creation to substitute for some privacy as well as non-intervention. Different kinds of like non-intervention lotteries, and entertainment lotteries, understanding as to why do we need to approach certain let knows always in a certain fashion of legitimacy or non-legitimacy why do we need to let know in a certain fashion? Creating and saying advocating can help, I am in the dimension I am in now. It still can by way of saying and coming up with communications pertaining to callwords. ExpAnding upon certain let knows. Attaching fun actions to my another dimensional selves. The idea that there are already beings who were promised promised land in a more wild westish kind of spot in which certain seemingly less brimstone places for what&#39;s acceptable then to have people and spirits, beings sit and there and say that they need to feng shui a new promise land. Gambling Centers different games Ode Realm style games that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I sort of have cussed out myself at times and others for so called squabbling when there is a bunch of other shit happening. It dawned on me that that should really be aimed to the authorities in charge to a certain extent, no offense, I do not mean to offend but at what point do i look around and say were squabbling below when. The sort of thing that has been happening at times in regards to switch, I have felt like there is thing I can switch like certain kinds of form and bodies being moved within a certain kind of way and while feeling like it overlaps my physical not necessarily so. The idea of doing certain advocations in regards to Educational interactives, like for example dinosaurs. Gaming Advocations and Creation Pertaining to Photography.<br><br>Advocationals: Alien White Beings, switching upon perception and action, paranormal research respect, spiritualist research gravity,  alien research belief, Desire to believe, certain kinds of Physical Feng Shui ers, message decoders, message creators, sign spirits. Think of it in regards to yourself, golden rule, peace, My innocence, My Economics and my businesses and monetaries, as well as my staff. Advocations for those that Advocations for my other dimensional selves in regards to my advocations, technically in regards to some of my advocations, I might only want to be doing the physical advocations, my likes and dislikes, Beings that traverse certain moments in a row or sporadically understanding that there is sometimes a job to do, understanding that we need help. Those in charge of these existences that my Main Camp indicated. Frazzled protection overwhelming protection, Beings that my Main Camp indicated, Channel Let knows and hud display pertaining to Alex James Hislop, Game commentary advocations, dimensional gaming commentary being placed in those that my Main Camp indicated, buttfuckery culture survival albeit not something we have to truly worry about I feel as I believe it will always be, for what&#39;s acceptable. <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. Light; Do what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to these advocations the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and Others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) consider the Light to be what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light.
