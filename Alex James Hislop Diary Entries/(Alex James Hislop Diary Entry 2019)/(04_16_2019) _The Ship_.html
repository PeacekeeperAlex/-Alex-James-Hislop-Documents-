<div class="title">(04/16/2019) &quot;The Ship&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Yesterday carried over in a certain manner and I remember being in the backyard standing there talking about different things as soon as I walked on the deck there spiritual cameras that I could feel and awareness as well as live feeling like large groups of spirits, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) were watching me but only for a moment to such an extent although those feelings never fully went away because it was thought that there were others potentially being attacked. I talked a bit about the idea of of how many versions of my incarnation and timelines as well as other dimensional selves in which I looked towards what had happened to me and what I chose as well as what I have done and it looks a certain way but I do not feel that there should be attack on the others that my Main Camp indicated in regards to myself that just when you look at it from a certain perspective that it makes no sense. I always addressed again the sort of thing I had been saying which was that I am not suppose to be in situations where I am going to respond with violence but rather worded it differently in which I will probably be saying from now on. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) want freewill in the ways that my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. Saying this later on after certain lives should work anyhow as it is a freedom of rights issue but there is also that sort of thing that certain realms can do, those areas and spaces where peoples and beings can say what their main camps, main spirit guides, main proxies, main authorities indicated in front of the scenes and in front of large groups of people to rectify certain things. What you say in life can matter but there is multiple kinds of opportunity and should be to be able to fix some of the things that have happened in multiple kinds of ways. The way I worded in my kitchen is starred information from myself and let know to Miscellathen, Gamifian and others(defined by my Main Camp) that it was as such the way my Main Camp indicated. There was moments where I felt like I was on a ship that reminded me of the left to a certain degree. A ship supposedly pointing towards holding areas as well as other dimensional existence let knows in that there can be all manner of setups in regards to how they are viewing myself. <br><br>Advocationals: <br>Self Mediation and Life situating in regards to splitting and combining throughout my Life as Alex James Hislop. <br>Letting know in regards to Alex James Hislop and how he has an opportunity in the physical in the ways that my Main Camp indicated<br>The preparation in regards to certain things and accords put into play as well as attachments in regards to things pertaining to Alex James Hislop and others(defined by my main Camp) in regards to  life preparation. <br>The stealing in regards to Alex James Hislop&#39;s past lives as well as the modification of barters to not reflect what was agreed upon in regards to the barting in regards to Alex James Hislop and others(defined by my main Camp).<br>Always remembering this physical life in the ways that my Main Camp indicated, especially the physical memory of the physical perspective in regards to the physical life of Alex James Hislop Fenbo44<br>The agreements, tells and let knows as well as hopes in regards to those that went a certain way of non-violence and peace pertaining to eventual information changing and acquiring of resources, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I am Alex James Hislop. My Main Camp is my Main Spirit Guides. I and Others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for what my Main Camp indicated in regards to the different ways to amalgamate life and lives as well as others(defined by my Main Camp) along with the systems that my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated.

If you look a certain way in a certain dimensional existence and intimacy is pursued where the experience, stimuli, form, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) would reflect what was desired in a certain manner the way my Main Camp indicated. <br>Existence Creators<br>Content Creators<br>Intimacy Creative<br><br>I am Alex James Hislop.
