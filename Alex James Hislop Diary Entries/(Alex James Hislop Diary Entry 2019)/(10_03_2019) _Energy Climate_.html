<div class="title">(10/03/2019) &quot;Energy Climate&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- Early viewing of Media in which I discern there to be a higher spirit and spirit that respects early morning news viewing similar to how some view going for walks before 9AM. I have noted that there different kinds in powers of positions specifically in regards to time that have relayed and a mindset by way of operating and opinion upon certain actions. Like working on cars after 4pm as well as 5pm in which both invoke a different feeling as well. Specific times in which can even bring fourth resources in which pursuing endeavors during certain times frames. Like shoveling snow between 6am and 7am. There is literal lists with this kind of opportune times and like abilities in regards to certain time frames and actions as well as non-actions. In which I feel night shift people should be given a reprieve in regards to be sleeping throughout the day. <br>- I went for a walk with Bogart my dog and there seemed to be some strange tidings and Climate when I was going for a walk. Stuff that in certain dimensional existences we might consider to be fore running to Apocalyptic variations. <br>- There was also a certain kind of sadness happening on my end in the energies I was able to discern. I could feel swathes of sadness and a certain kind of morning impression as well as dew impression. Again something to do with weather taking place but also mixed with atmospherical conditions reflecting, sadness, anxiety, calmness. Recovery energies placed upon me as well. Summer is leaving but it also has to do with something else as well. <br>- There was a trying to maneuver spiritual story that somehow I had to choose to promote certain kinds of actions within the past couple of days based upon subtle story tells and things of that nature . I think it&#39;s a ruse but maybe not. It might be a certain kind of interaction in which not be what some think it to be. <br>- Seriously some big moving and changes going on, comedy changed, insinuated the certain comedy was going towards certain bad spots but I am not certain that&#39;s true. A lot of cleaner energies and I continue to see spirit moving forward in a certain dimensional stimuli. Multiple understandings supposedly that certain infrastructure is changing. I am wondering what this day was all about to be honest, kind of kept in the dark, tells of Anti-Camp leaving but also that there is still certain kind around. Interaction getting better, cleaner energies but not all is what seems to be and just after this walk I am not certain even more so. Some trying trying to claim that certain physical information that I have created to be their but for the exceptions of the List that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, this is not the Truth.<br>- ThePsychicWarGamers content was created and certain Spiritual turbulence where I defended myself took place. Something spiritually was over and certain banner deployment more to do with something else happened in which I potentially lent towards in certain capacities. <br>- During half way through the day there was low body energy and I decided to lay down and just a write on my tablet, I felt there was a switch at a certain point in time and after the good first half of the day of getting things done it felt to be changing into something else. It was as if some other kind of spirit switched off to influence this process but there was also spiritual events taking place in which might have been utilizing the energy in which I was hooked into. It lends to reasoning that our energies are utilized by the spirit around us at times sometimes speaking of reasonings that we feel the way we do at times in which sometimes impacts how we proceed within life.<br>- I decided to just work on finishing what I had planned on getting done this day. There were hints that some were forming up in the spirit in regards to a certain conflict. When I started ThePsychicWarGamers Content midway through where there was said to be certain spirit trying to influence myself and others supposedly and I did feel certain stimuli in supporting that some of it was negative especially to get me to be a certain kind of erratic at one point near the midway through the content. I defended myself spiritually and others that my Main Spirit Guides during the content by way of visualization access utilized to the Callwords that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. Truth, Truth Defense, Clarifications and other kinds in which are literal energy promotions I was able to do via defense. This defense partially took place by way of a certain utilization in regards to myself and other that my Main Spriit Guides indicated and if it wasn&#39;t needed then what my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding can take care of it on their end, they can facilitate for the situations at hand in which they let know pertaining to what I was doing with my defensive works through the video game content. After the content I went outside and did more visualization defense in regards to bringing up the footage that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. Proxy suppression and action utilization in regards to actions pertaining to myself especially during moment where I feel I need to defend myself are not the answer and I think this was addressed yesterday spiritually and has been multiple times in which has indicated that there has at times been proxy suppression and negative action attachment in which is not beneficial during certain moments. When I went inside I would notice a certain kind of deployment in regards to certain spiritual in which were set out for some of them to talk for an extended period of time. I noticed certain earth-based culture utilization in regards to some of it but not all was that I believe. <br><br><br>Information Creation:<br>(Doesn&#39;t always include all of the information that I create throughout the Day)<br>Retirement Plan Advocations (AJH Daily Defensives Board x31)<br>Seemingly Immorality and Immorality Advocations and disclaimers (AJHD Daily Defensives Board x31) <br>Defense Board: Lovers List and Disclaimers as well as an advocation in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
