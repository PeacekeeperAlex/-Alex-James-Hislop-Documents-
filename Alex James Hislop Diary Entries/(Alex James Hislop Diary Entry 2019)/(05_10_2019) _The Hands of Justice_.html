<div class="title">(05/10/2019) &quot;The Hands of Justice&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>Today has been quite toned down a bit. Certain figured continue to be brought up or at least form-wise. Certain anti-camp metaphorical as well as pro-camp metaphorical but also potentially communal related and/or family related. After some of the events of yesterday I feel that a look at this process and others(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to acceleration and deceleration has been noted and some of it has been observed, some of which happens to do with mechanisms pulling and utilization of certain traits and qualities as well smachinisms. How is the incarnational in regards to some of this stuff fairing specifically in regards to those supposed to be pulling from certain areas and mechanisms. I felt bigging up again by way of researching physical origins in the internet which feels like another tactic to forget about some of points that people are looking at, some of which had to do with looking at my physical family that my main camp indicated properties that my Main Camp indicated and others(defined by my Main Camp) which was interesting to compare in regards to different time periods. Another thing happening was clarifications in regards to Main Spirit Guide Groups and Main Camp Groups. Some are still working on past issues as well though which is a good thing. I have been working on this book, God-Realization spin on certain spiritual topic the Untitled learning to love project which I feel is going well and the idea to put the topic of God-Realization sort of gave me new hope to the book which I feel is decent as I was at a point where I didn&#39;t know how I was going to proceed. Coupled with researching the topic points it&#39;s going well. At the end of the day I put into play (AJHD) Main Spirit Guides information and (AJHD) Alex James Hislop and Others(defined by my Main Camp) Main Spirit Guides. THere was also revelation of certain people and characters which are somehow linked to my process in certain manners, life being shaped around myself in which at times for some can feel like no choice but to be linked to my process. <br><br>Defense:<br>Has the showhoring of mechanisms to utilize in regards to others meant for certain spirits and god been working? What mechanisms am I pulling from especially in regards to the larger Mechanisms? Are they mine? What is that affecting especially if it is not mine? What kinds would try to get me to pull from larger mechanisms and what kind have those working against me been getting to pull from my mechanisms? What the heck was created in the beginning of certain thresholds and how the heck did it turn out? They have insinuated that there was someone who created a lot in regards to my life and others(defined by my Main Camp) and what does that mean especially in regards to this life was fully not known to emerge in the ways that it did especially when cross referencing with those lives that seemingly look similar in certain ways as to mine if I had not gone certain direction that some would consider to be heightened process at times. What other documents in other dimensional existences have been put into play and why is it seemingly being ignored in certain puzzle pieces, especially when it wasn&#39;t puzzle piece specific for what&#39;s acceptable.<br>Transfer overing at times I have referred to placement of dimensional area to other kind of dimensional area changing the physics and interaction in regards to the idmension itself in some cases. Pain threshold is good example. We move a planet in which is similar to earth. Pain is experiences in a certain way but it&#39;s mostly agree upon by way of consent in regards to amount of pain each person would feel. the interaction in regards to pain realms can still be facilitated by way of how we experience pain and stimuli in regards to the technology that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. How were dimensions created? exactly. Construction is another sort of way as well as evolution and I feel there are shapers of evolution as well too. So someone burns their hand and only feels the allotted amount of pain that they disred There are those that look at law, culture, banner and other kind of things in which can feel difficult to be able to work through to then be able to see what we can facilitate at times but there is merit and the research regarding is needed. There should be teams though skipping past that and looking towards entire transfers over and then facilitation of that culture, law, banner and other kind of things. So you have dimensional area in which overlaps certain kinds of spiritual. Transfering over that dimensional in certain fashion after cross referencing the information that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. You have multiple teams, one of which looks at how to facilitate the cultures, banners, law, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) of that dimensional existence if there were to be transferred to another dimensional area. Another team looks at it from trying to facilitate culture, banners, law, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) to be able to transfer it over then the two teams compare the research, cross reference and compare to what those laws, banners, culture looked like before then interjecting the information that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>Physical Creation, why was it that there is seemingly less God-Interaction in the physical itself? Why is their pain? Why do certain bad things happen? Life span and death? Imagine a pool system with points upon creation. That upon spending points in regards to what you could put within the physical and the kinds of things you put to potentially shape the physical potentially evolution shaping accurment as well. Simplicity, creator gets 100 points and each point adds to something additive in a certain way and when those 100 points run out something might have been observed that we would nee more points. One of the ways to achieve that might be certain kinds of negatives in regards to the creation itself. I look to pain as a potential example but that might be more species based. The idea to choose more negatives to then get the points desired to able to achieve what was partially visioned Is this partially the case? potentially a part of it. The idea of what was a part of the physical creation and the accords pertaining matters greatly. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for safety and defense in regards to the safeguards and defenders that my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. Those Feng shuied to be something to me in certain dimensional existences which the question is asked as to why that is.The disparity and seemingly disparity in regards to those get resources and those that don&#39;t.<br>The topic of why certain things are making it into the interaction regards myself in regards to certain things is interesting partially by way of what&#39;s been insinuated in regards to myself and others that my Main Camp indicated in regards to what I affect and the kinds of impact that my process has had on the world. <br><br>Advocations:<br>Artist&#39;s vision of who people want to be being displayed in those moments of shaping in regards to others lives where it takes place in the areas that my Main Camp indicated.
