<div class="title">(08/04/2019) &quot;Onwards and Upwards&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- The kinds of systems that have been on me at night and even during the day these days are the ones in which I can bring up a subject and feel the presence of some in regards to different themes. Story certain kind in which emphasis pertaining to prompts, quick impact and contained and I also discern a tightening of the screws in regards to multiple aspects of this kind of interaction systems as well as dimensional setup, especially in regards to Ripple effect. We need to understand though if there is problematics with this system specifically in regards to my actions, non-action, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) as well as the Actions, Non-Actions, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) of those that my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. <br>- We continued to see that it has less to do with the kinds of things that I am Creating for what&#39;s acceptable, is that unfair? Yeah, they would point towards some of the things that I create but my defense in regards to that is air tight. I have continued to defend myself in different kinds of manners and coupled with the kinds of things that the spiritual have been defending me with specific in regards to informational creation lets know that that is not much of a decent route to utilize in regards to blame regardless of how big or powerful some are. There was a side thing in regards to a key moment in which was thought of by some, including myself in which I looked towards mine and it looked to be insults that were supposedly causing some of the things that had happened within the past month or so, part of it anyhow because it wasn&#39;t exclusively said but higher up there was something about it to a certain degree. Not that I insult too much with verbal spars as that is the look in regards to that sort of thing but it was nonetheless a bit of a problematic here and there within the past six month and nowhere near as bad as it used to be. The argumentatives again have been better too since november of last years and onwards to a certain extent. Also the defensives tones have been getting better as well especially this past week. There was a bit a of a kerfuffle with blaming certain conversations but that wasn&#39;t going to be it especially in regards to the context upon myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Either way don&#39;t let it fool you into thinking that verbal spars utilized in a vent fashion and not so, defensive tones, Conversation and argumentatives constitute some of things done to myself and others because even from that lens the case of defense regarding myself is solid and wins in most instances. It&#39;s as some have been saying at times that there is conflict in regards to  certain areas that have been happening for a while now and events taking place these days that hopefully and not have been taking place for a while now, hopefully for stark impact at times and hopefully not for the lunacy that that laments upon. The informational placement I have discerned to be needed and only pertains to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>- The ones I have looked at being action attachment, proxy suppression, abuse of Authority, Corruption, Ripple affect, psychological and influencing and communication and.or lack thereof should really be defended from the Good Guys of those concepts viewpoint in regards to my physical perspective defense pertaining to those concepts as I have utilized defensives even with trying to stay away from blame pertaining. Noted. Memory as well is another that should be given some attention as well always and I know some say that we need to be careful with memory but at what point is it utilized against just to forget some of the things that we need to remembers and even from a banner perspective they can see that line sometimes in a more brimstone manner. <br>- I worshipped female yesterday by way of pinterest viewing beautiful cartoon feminine form in which turned into a certain kind of interaction. At first it was tried to go a certain direction which felt amazing and some would point towards some of the darker aspects that I found via form search in regards to that sort of thing but I call hogwash on that nonsense. People should be able to view a female form holding a knife without somebody going batshit and harming people. If that isn&#39;t the case i know there is certain kinds of psychologicals then we need certain safeguards and not red tape that is going to cause more problems. One thing that I saw that really stood out was this female sporty biker chick on a pink bike with a bunny symbol on her helmet, blonde with shinning light that looked painted from a god. She had a symbol on her shoulder which reminded me of the peace symbol with without one of the lines. I looked at the missing symbol and looked at one of the decals that said I play to Win and I said One in which sound like Won which made the peace symbol realized. It&#39;s the kind of stuff hard to describe at times but it felt like a really amazing spiritual interaction. I can see pictures moving like there is spiritual interaction happening with them, there are different kinds, one with subtle movement and others similar to that of Harry Potter portrait and artwork on the wall movement. Another image was said to be someone looking down and a light of all saving. Symbolism of sadness and anger as well as revenge and defense. Internal Justice. Soldiery. With friends in the wings. There were moments where it reminded me of my aunt louise and my father. Sloth in the background. <br>- Still discern this arms race to the top sort of stuff and it really is just a bit much but when you look below at what some are doing and upon why some would be racing up above there is understanding. What needs to be understood at times for some is the context in how this works like dimensional setup and things of that nature, that there multiple overlaps that exist in regards to the dimensions and that this one that feels me traversing and moving upwards as well as those ones in which feels like driving forwards is not necessarily a reflection in regards to all of the dimensional overlaps that exist around myself and others but that it is a big one so said. <br>- Multiple situations in regards to Earth yesterday and today and I am wondering  for what that means today and also there is other kinds as well where it is potentially happening from afar in which I do have reservations to a certain degree, I wouldn&#39;t in a certain context and some of it i don&#39;t but I feel that some of it i do. The locals are restless and so am I at times. <br><br>Advocationals:<br><br>I am Alex James Hislop. My Main Camp is my Main Spirit Guides.
