<div class="title">(01/12/2019) &quot;Stagedoor Stare&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: I watched all about eve (1950), its this amazing old school movie Bettie Davis movie in which the feeling of the whole movie has this wonderful vibe and dialogue, the spiritual aspects to this movie are all star and it has such a legacy feel callback the 40s. I caught most of the film but missed pieces but it&#39;s about acting and one of my favorite scenes was the theatre scenes, spiritually there was great talking to going on but there was also this movement in regards to the stage, entertainment and fame a sort of impression that was happening specifically in regards to when he walked on stage and certain mechanism of acting we&#39;re about him but of course it was part of the stage, potentially movie kind of stuff but on stage lametenting on the fame of the stage itself. Although not new spiritual mechanisms  in the movie and noticing although could on my end coffee the screen but really lends to the movies. I woke up fairly early today. Another sort of thing. Story and realism are still somewhat talked about by myself although do want me to take a step back even though I don&#39;t talk about it too much, the idea of certain things happening and prompts being created for story and other such things. On one hand you have multiple different kinds of cues in film and things of that nature but are those who sometimes are able to seemingly affect movies, sometimes you a certain kinds of prompts hat are potentially there where spirits can affect your process and there seemingly sometime happen but that doesn&#39;t mean its not a part or the story, first there is multiple things happening potentially on others dimensional existences so fully affect is not fully understood for what acceptable, then there is that sort of thing where multiple people and spirits affect action and in the physical on my end it might be more plausible but not necessarily exclusive. There is also that story aspect which is part of it that potentially it was suppose to be multiple to lead you to a conclusion or that you were suppose to know that it was only certain spirits affecting which still can be the case. I Feel like there has been light and dark conflict the day before but there is also sometimes that sort of thing where conflict takes place to Stave other kinds of conflict. Be wary still although I do feel like the good guys are still around and multiple incarnations were to have happened. I talked about more ways we can do certain thing within the confines of consent and different kinds of ways to do immorality seemingly and otherwise with the spirit instead of being harmed as well what my main camp indicated in regards to a wide different amount of topics. I and others defined by my main camp are advocating for what my main camp indicated in regards to what they chose for this advocations the way my main camp indicated. I feel like there has been tactic utilized against me in a certain way, I was brought up and the beliefs I feel were fairly influenced it felt like a certain systems of getting me t o argue was utilized in a certain fashion, it didn&#39;t feel like those who usually utilize it but then again systems also deal multiple kinds of spirits. There has been a bit of score keep in regards to my days but I feel like about 10 out of the twelves days  have been decnet with that beings said not everyone has the same standards, even If I did technically win those in some sort of productivity thing, potentially there is certain areas I could have improved by way of decent- Needs Improvement and they say it&#39;s six-six potentially in that regard. <br>(1st, 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th, 12th, )<br>(2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 11th,)<br>Any how it&#39;s been a bit of a let know that some spirits are just upset about certain things, having to hold it down here when things are going on, certain vindication potentially mind included, certain kinds of routes and as of lates. Even perception and disagreements. Either way there is those who are upset and I am not certain no amount of let know in regards to certain kinds of immorality promotion is going to change some of them, heck some get even angrier which makes no sense when the transfer sort of thing is a possibility, but I don&#39;t understand the full extent of it. When I do I hope I am not hard pressed to not change my mind on certain things. <br><br>Defence: There was let know that certain spirits are going to be working and have been working on certain things in pertaining to realism, to thinking, <br>Effort and activity pertaining to utilization against myself to a certain extent. Cognitives being targeted and attacked as well as memory. The idea to get certain spirits to run treadmills to save my life especially within the confines of myself not wanting to run treadmills to animosity. I and others defined by my main camp are advocating for what my main camp indicated in regards to this marking, etc.(defined by my main camp) the way my main camp indicated. There was let know that exacerbation is happening in OCD ways and things of that nature regarding certain spirits and hand writing.  Rope and dope sort of thing in regards to Alex James Hislop winning ad then have it have said to use it against him in certain ways. Them trying to get certain kinds of aggressive responses from myself but also subdue me when I need to do try and help.<br><br>IDEA: The idea of your body being some sort city or country elsewhere. A fiction novel about cancer, this disease that in the story is actually the good guys, marching through to save the day revealed at the ending to cancer in a bigger being. That on sleep I have noticed that you a potentially carrying passenger upon consciousness that it&#39;s also jumping point for spirits which can set tone for a day and more.<br><br>Info: passing dimensional mechanisms on lineage and relation, metamorphosis after passing on, the relation of birth being influenced by more than just live dimensional seemingly parental relation and certain spiritual influences the idea of other live dimensions and other dimensionals being a part of birth, parental, creation. Mannerisms, demeanor a, personality, mentality, ality, channeling, other dimensional affects. Magic within movies exist in regards to different things I have felt energy affects, the ideas of fantasy existing around has been said many times and that there is realism within film, the same thing could potentially be said about some of the magic within film.<br><br>Advocationals: Banners, those affected by my impact specifically those who are interested benefitting by me being as well as others that my main camp indicated. Peripherals, Myself, retrofitters, Gaming, Belief, Main Spirit Guides, Contact Spirits, Awareness, Team and Groups especially in regards to those physicals that my Main Camp indicated on Earth, <br><br>Foods, health, vitamins:<br>Chilli<br>Fox thoughts x2<br>Synergy Multivitamin x2<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. Light; Do what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to these advocations the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and Others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) consider the Light to be what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) consider Far Away Light to be the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are playing the cards that my Main Camp indicated in the moments that my Main Camp indicated especially in regards to the Amount of Times I have been stabbed in the Back Defensive Card to Defend behind our Backs, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
