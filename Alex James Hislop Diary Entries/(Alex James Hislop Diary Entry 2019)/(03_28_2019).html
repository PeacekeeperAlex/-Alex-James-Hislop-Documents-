<div class="content">Activity: I worked on multiple kinds of Document, some of which has to do with process alternatives in regards to spirits and being utilizing certain kinds of lives in which to then create those process alternatives and facilitate those process alternatives the way my Main Camp indicated. The other thought process was to create names for groupings of spirits, beings, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) to be able to utilize advocationals in regards the way my Main Camp indicated. There might be processes in regards to this sort of thing as well and one of the document I created specifically in regards to this was the (AJHD) Jinrai. The idea was to create terms for groups of peoples and spirits and create advocations for them the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>Another thought on multiple kinds of document I could create could be Buffer processes as well as Content experience processes in which at times there has been discrepancies in regards to disnring the to by the way of the nature of the terms as well as societal practices. The idea for some of this would be to create a process document, for example (AJHD) Test Buffer Process, which you then create disclaimers, advocations, and if you want testifications but you could do a whole bunch with the advocations portions, even leading towards advocations in regards to body creation and atmospherics but for some I would emphasis if possible the kinds of parameters that you want to work with. Your Main Spirit Guides and Main Authorities should take care of it on their end and elsewhere either way so if that means putting that in your disclaimers and things of that nature then I feel that would be beneficial but there is merit and validity in explaining and putting description within. IE: Letting know that you want certain kinds of A.I. buffers that would not experiencing pain and suffering should the buffers be used in that fashion. Or that you want the A.I. to be able to experiencing a large amount of good life to balance out should you be utilizing these buffers in a brimstone manner, like using a buffer when getting attacked as a certain kinds of shield, the process moves into your process to take the blow in which you could also then put more advocations into play in regards to the defense of the buffer itself in which certain spiritual around may be facilitating in ways in which your Main Spirit Guides and Main Authorities indicated. <br><br>The other thought was to was to create Groupings of Terms in regards to certain peoples and processes to be able to utilize the written word and other forms of communication and information to be able to help those peoples as well as Terms in which was not necessarily born of or thought of to be in regards to certain peoples but rather was created with purpose to help regardless of attachment or tethering. <br><br>Defense: <br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for what my Main Camp indicated in regards to the events that took place on the 26th, 2019 that my Main Camp indicated and those affected that my Main Camp indicated by way of those that my Main Camp indicated having to incarnate, change plans especially in regards to the streamlining taking place the way my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for the movies that my Main Camp indicated and the content that my Main Camp indicated to be experienced by those that my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for facilitation of access in regards to what my Main Camp indicated to be able to work through what my Main Camp indicated in regards to certain kinds of life and otherwise the way my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Mian Camp) are advocating for those that my Main Camp indicated to be able to experience and live the lives that my Main Camp indicated and what my Main Camp indicated with the purpose to the to be able to utilize those lives and what my Main Camp indicated to help others by way of experiencing those lives and what my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated Alternatives in regards to this by way of what my Main Camp indicated and others(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for the information that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the events that my Main Camp indicated to be experienced the way my Main Camp indicated. <br><br>I take the stance that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Imagine you aligned with all of your being and even got the opinions of those asleep and took a stand in regards to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated, at what point does Far Away Light and the Far Away Dimensions say that their Brother and Family have been wronged and that there does need to be Justice? That&#39;s Justice? Folks? When some of us are only looking to be able to live the way we want too without being attacked in the ways we didn&#39;t want to experience? Equality like standing up for those below that would want to be saved? When you see an entire being aligned when would it be that Far Away Light and Far Away Dimensions would move in to save?<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.

I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for Historical Reputational Defense in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and the Historians that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Clickable links like the show all actions on the Peacekeeperalex trello account and attachments section where upon me clicking links shows up on my screen has been at times shoehorned into a spot where some in the spirit think that it needs to be shown in order for it to work. If I never traverse to Google.ca that doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist in the public especially the spiritually that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The data upon clicking some of those links on the peacekeeperalex trello account and the Alex James Hislop Documents on Github are public regardless of whether I click them or not, they have public links in which exist online especially in regards to the Spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
