<div class="title">(08/09/2019) &quot;Why again?&quot;</div>
<div class="content">- Yesterday Night and early morning an implosion happening again. The past eight days has been interesting as I have felt a certain system be utilized elsewhere, a certain kind of interaction in regards to defensive channeling and defensive tones to a certain extent in which I feel does not deserve to take the blame regarding certain things. Certain baddies doing certain things now it&#39;s one thing for this to be the only moment within the past eight days but what&#39;s really scary is this being let know of what it&#39;s been for the past weight days for some. What&#39;s the truth? Those deals that situate and say that what&#39;s bad that&#39;s been happening doesn&#39;t happen and doesn&#39;t exist nor did it can make it more difficult for some in regards to certain conversation and legality but hey, those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated are correct in that if were past that point of needing proof in regards to certain things and we are going round and round in regards to the conversation then I suppose it&#39;s actually a decent within a bigger indecent. <br> - Peoples attacked in multiple forms and it was said that certain kinds of lovers were attacked yesterday as well as family in regards to certain kinds of spirits. They said to have attacked me and others as well in certain ways but I am not certain that happened. <br>- Today a bunch of decent interactions happened. I can&#39;t help but shake the feeling that someone is trying to facilitate certain things potentially a long game kind of plat but wouldn&#39;t it be nice for it to have been just a decent and maybe I should stop looking over my should but alas yesterday was also lamented upon that there seems to be some that are following us or at least was, something potentially changed so maybe i don&#39;t need to look over my shoulder. <br> - Reminders of Anti-Camp advocations and continued emphasis in regards to out loud verbal advocations which I feel I was going to start a bit of an emphasis today has potentially lamented upon something taking place in regards to verbal physical out loud advocation frameworks as well as others. <br> - Past process has been around today in multiple forms and again a focus on wet and dry symbolizing entertainment but something elses as well. <br> - Those facilitating my life, the buffers and the life utilization, I am wondering what it looks like on their end. There was a work focus and emphasis to a certain degree from some. <br> - A lot of time on me as well today which makes me hesitant, I feel there are some not benefitting from a certain placement on me, best to do advocations in regards. <br> - Another conversation and talking point has been the kind pertaining to action attachments and unconsented immorality small actions to facilitate survival for some. <br>- The spirit around me have been fairly secretive and illusive but almost to the point where they want me to keep asking what is going on to a certain extent. I am not certain what is fulling taking place but it seems to be a large life review and certain kinds of past process and present process meeting points potentially with some in regards to the Future. Not certain why this is happening but they continue to lament upon something in regards to myself and others in regards to something decent but again have tried to let know that there is potentially some bad stuff happening as well. I don&#39;t feel letting know of the bad stuff happening let knows and actions attachment having it have happen is good enough.<br>- Topic Point, those that do bad and know that they did bad and pretending that they didn&#39;t, those looking at bad stuff while pretending to be good and being good. A certain kind and way talked about today and others in which there has been a specific emphasis in regards to those continuing to do bad and harming and that being ignored because some are good as ell as other reasonings. <br><br>Advocationals:<br>Time<br>Those not benefitting from my process.<br>Morality Utilization<br>Stacking Good life to perpetuate more immorality<br>Metaphorical and Action Attachments<br>Ripple Affect and informational Placement<br>Conjugal Visit for Prisons that my Main Spirit Guides indicated<br>Two things being mixed up: (1) Whether my direction and choice were affected by the Immoral actions that has happened to me and others that my Main Spirit guides indicated. (2) Playing those systems of morality promotion in regards to immorality promotion kind of stuff. The former, I can&#39;t fully say that some of the immorality that has happened to me and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated hasn&#39;t affected my direction and choices. The latter, I want to say that I don&#39;t play that kind of thing in regards to promoting amount of morality in regards to immorality but I fully go with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated for what they chose for me to go the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) choose what my Main Spirit Guides indicated for us to Choose the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.

Clickable links like the show all actions on the Peacekeeperalex trello account and attachments section where upon me clicking links shows up on my screen has been at times shoehorned into a spot where some in the spirit think that it needs to be shown in order for it to work. If I never traverse to Google.ca that doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist in the public especially the spiritually that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The data upon clicking some of those links on the peacekeeperalex trello account and the Alex James Hislop Documents on Github are public regardless of whether I click them or not, they have public links in which exist online especially in regards to the Spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
