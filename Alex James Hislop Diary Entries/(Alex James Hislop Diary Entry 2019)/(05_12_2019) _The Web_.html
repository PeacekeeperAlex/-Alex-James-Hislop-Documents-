<div class="title">(05/12/2019) &quot;The Web&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: Early Morning spirits combined myself with what they were insinuating to be me uncombine but I think it&#39;s a mixed bag and it was in regards to certain spirit that were hanging over Alex-PC in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated but that might not be true either. It felt like they combined with my perspective and I felt spirits come at me in a certain kind of way but the idea was that there was something there that saved me. There was also a let know of places in which have to do with facilitating certain kinds of spirit in different ways, direction in regards to groupings and even dark sides of self in certain manners which is a part of certain recovery. Also the idea of having to watch oneself and the kinds of actions one promotes in regards to oneself but as we have seen today already the tactic of utilization in regards to onself being the bad guy falls flat when there is psychological making it that way in which was not intended and claiming bad guy needs to vent make those that have been looking at why those venting areas and gaming existences to facilitate not getting through even more vindicated. I don&#39;t mean to be rigid but I am looking at it from the perspective of literally being forced to do harm and hurt in manners in which for some is not at all what you are trying to facilitate your bodies and mechanisms where it can feel like something is controlling you but also circumstantially being forced to attack by way of the tangled that has happened in regards to the direction that we have gone. I went to a new spot and did certain advocations and felt elevation differences in the spirit but I am wondering if it&#39;s a tactic to utilize in which I wouldn&#39;t be able to fully take advantage of as many well as others(defined by my Main Camp). Either way though some changes happened to the planet and I am not certain it&#39;s exclusive for what&#39;s acceptable.<br>Circumstances forcing people to have to be a certain stance, ways to fix those circumstances. <br><br><br>Advocationals:<br>Caches of memories and existences being thrown in certain as a draw and payment, <br>Spirits that create caches and replicas<br>Those that create certain systems<br>Identifiers, creating 11 or more identifiers which could help in multiple kinds of ways but we should really base some of it off of names and identifiers that are already in play or in front of the scenes in CA certain manner but another thing decent to work on is grouping of identifiers being the same thing, multiple kinds of spirits have different names in regards to the same thing in which grouping names for identifiers would also help.<br>Updates utilization especially reactions and experiencing certain things IE: you watch a movie and there is a certain framework where then upon which you can from pertaining to certain bodies and atmospherics that can be utilized in regards to later on in certain process, like pulling from those those lives that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that were in earlier process to then to see reaction of how that process turned out by way of interaction.<br>Time to catch up on story continuation and content experiences that have been created. <br>Parents Conflict vs Lovers Conflict Content Experiences. <br><br>Defense:<br>Precepting being able to interact with different perception infrastructure while still retaining the desired affect in regards to one&#39;s life as well mobility perception set the way those intended <br>Those that are left behind upon the event in regards to moving upward energy.<br>The comparison of how long ago something had been sadi as to when we were going to get better that we were going to be ok and that we were going to be able to pursue. How long was it back then that it was supposed to be, where are we now and how long is it now and compare. Those that my Main Camp indicated don&#39;t want to hear about how we need to sabotage each other about different direction any longer. Not acceptable in regards to the circumstances and lives at stake. <br>For some the idea that there has been morality and positively utilized against to harm has been present in multiple kinds of ways, partially to heighten process in which when coupled with the kind immorality and negative experiences that have happened makes it look like something that wasn&#39;t promised in regards to defending us. With all of decent and positive for some look towards the fact that you can&#39;t give a simple decent life?<br>Perception of other countries and dialect and the importance of that sort of thing in regards to those that are impacting in large degrees as well as not so, sometimes the small is the big and/or becomes the big. <br>access to see some of the realism and layer shiftings in regards to certain events especially in regards to those dimensionals that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>buffers to focusing in on things to interact and segway team specifically in regards to focusing in on different events <br>access to my process and others(defined by my Main Camp) <br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are telling the Light to do what my Main Camp indicated in regards to the combining pertaining to myself that takes place the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I need let knows in regards to what was mapped out and I want the knowledge that my Main Spirit Guides to be understood the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I need my Guides that my Main Spirit Guides information that my Main Spirit Guides indicated to make it through to where my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated.<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. Light; Do what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to these advocations the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and Others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) consider the Light to be what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light.

I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for the Historians that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this marking, advocation, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) to write down the information that I create that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for the Historians that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this marking, advocation, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) to write down the information that I create that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for those Historians that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and History to be protected the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for Historical Reputational Defense in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and the Historians that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Clickable links like the show all actions on the Peacekeeperalex trello account and attachments section where upon me clicking links shows up on my screen has been at times shoehorned into a spot where some in the spirit think that it needs to be shown in order for it to work. If I never traverse to Google.ca that doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist in the public especially the spiritually that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The data upon clicking some of those links on the peacekeeperalex trello account and the Alex James Hislop Documents on Github are public regardless of whether I click them or not, they have public links in which exist online especially in regards to the Spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. For example: https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5c28ed8f3e323f6a9f16d775/5c28edf56e82f20db23bda17/1bbaa58626a33ae318be5777687da03c/(AJHD)_the_way_my_Main_Camp_indicated.txt , that exists publically regardless of whether I click it or not. Another example is : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PeacekeeperAlex/-Alex-James-Hislop-Documents-/master/(AJHD)%20AJH%20Monetary%20Creation.txt , You don&#39;t need to sign in to see any of the physical information there, you can open it in a incognito window and it will display. https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5b3546fd00481cc3f86f5b01/5c95f6df01642a7b47cefd84/5351fa2f4c120894fde5b952dd8601f2/(AJHD)_Google.txt I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for this paragraph to be placed where my Main Spirit Guides indicated daily the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br></div>
