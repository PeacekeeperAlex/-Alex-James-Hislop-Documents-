<div class="title">(12/14/2019) Unbreakable</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>This process keeps changing. I can feel some of my other-dimensional surroundings and have been able to discern some of the changes that continue to take place. Movement upwards has been a classic one to note and whether I have been traversing on a treadmill and not really moving upwards has been debated and talked about by some of the spirit around me. I think it&#39;s both to be true. That I have and others that my Main Spriit Guides indicated have continued to move upwards to different vibrations, frequencies, tone and area in which some of us would note the changes taking place. Cleaner energies, less crowded and less turbulence while again for some of us able to feel some of the turbulence that exists in certain places that use to exist more immediately in the process. Then there are those trying to say that some of us have moved upwards. It might tie into that sort of thing I have noted that upon me being shoehorned elsewhere that there is a nefarious kind in which has been getting certain spirit to pretend to be me and utilization in regards to certain kind of anatomy sometimes from myself in which the bad guys are depicted to get away and not be prosecuted. This has been changing as well. Some of it is entertainment but some it has not been. Some of this has been real in noting that there are those trying to pretend to be certain kind and on my end have it be said that the information that I create somehow does not pertain to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I create disclaimers. The Disclaimers Help. Some try to disrupt by claiming that those disclaimers pertain to something in which it does not. It&#39;s done in multiple manners both to help and to harm. It laments that there has been multiple kinds of spirit associated in regards to this process and if I know I have been the Good Spriit. One of those things where would we would see facilitation in regards to the bad spirit leaving this process. Past six months you can note the kind of Bad Spirit that have been traversing away from here and what kind of facilitation it&#39;s actually been. <br>There have been events taking place in regards to some of the spiritual, some of which has been facilitated on my end but what kind of facilitation is happening out there in the world? A lot of what is seen is the spiritual and enlightened pertaining to some of the spiritualist communities at least observed from some of the physicals and other-dimensionals. Are we suppose to not pay attention to that in which is happening in other places Are we not suppose to care for one another and treat each other with kindness, care and compassion in which is a part of the let knows of a decent sized portion of the afterlife. Somehow there is an underlying culture in which operates in a different manner and in being able to discern such a culture and aware of such a culture I have understood that I don&#39;t just want to let go of writing about this culture but that I still want to be sane. How can it be said that I shouldn&#39;t let know of such happenings behind the scenes and experiences that I a noting with such a strong conviction existing within those that have been to this earth before and for some have shook their fists to the kinds of things taking place at times. A great many of them don&#39;t deny that the spiritual exists and that the enlightenment is there but rather sometimes gawk at that fact for reasonings that are self explanatory. <br>I would note a spiritually combining would happen a couple days previous in regards to myself in which I could feel a certain kind try to portray as somehow myself being the bad spirit. It&#39;s understood on a baseline that I am not the bad and that my actions have continued to prove it. When they compare my bad actions to my good actions there is no comparison which is partially why when I talk about this next point it lends motive to why some are proceeding in the ways explained. That there are those still trying to split my Godspark, Consciousness, Perspective and other kinds to have it be labelled my Anti-Camp, a certain kind of spirit that hangs around and tries to work against. Can you imagine a certain spirit sectioning off part of your consciousness, instilling a certain kind of demeanor and behavior and then influencing them to remember things in which might not be true to get them to be working against in a certain capacity. The kicker has to do with the idea that they then attack that sectioned off consciousness as way to attack in which is then labelled like they are trying to save. It&#39;s the kind of stuff I have been aware of in a certain manner and this day was different in a certain extent. I had noted a hanging around mentality in which also lent towards energy placement of similar in regards to the idea that somehow there was a portion of spirit in which wire utilizing other dimensional self infrastructure to do bad things. There are many safeguards in regards to this kind of thing. But I still felt this lingering energy placements and mentality to the idea that I was being utilized behind the scenes in regard to other dimensional selves and allpersonal as well as those utilizing life to do certain things in which a portion of them did not want to do and that I didn&#39;t want to do. In places where psychological influencing exists in such ways as to affect and change your ways of operating even to the point of memory manipulation you can see why some have difficult times withstanding certain kinds of influencing. I would change this mentality and utilize an actions of knowing and change in regards to that in which was saying that somehow I was being affected by behind the scenes spirits in certain manners. When certain spirits combined I felt placement of other dimensional in which let know that there was those adverse with me changing this and that they were trying to harm me spiritually. I felt like some of the spirit that combined were attacked as well and hurt and that hurt impressed upon in which a spirit of super healing came around me especially upon stepping on earth that healed me quickly partially by way of some of the happenings that were taking place on earth. It might have been this night that the spirit invoked me being scene in a more global way I could feel that there were blocks when I stood on earth but that I was being scene globally anyhow regardless in a certain manner both while standing on earth and not so but just as there was a difference in regards to standing on earth or sitting in my office, there was also a difference between unblocking some of those energies on earth while standing on earth. An interaction system came with me when I walked back inside on whichever day it happened regardless of if it wasn&#39;t this day because there have been moments when I would stand on earth and that spirit would urge me to stand on earth even in the late-beginnings of winter. One of the stimuli that i felt on my head are in which was the main of combining and in front of the scenes combining too like feeling other dimensional infrastructure in regards to my head moved outwards and away from my head area for a period of time before this day. I could note the difference between more behind the scenes spiritually in which probably can sense more in front of the scenes spiritually in which is a logical extrapolation given my knowledge. This in front of the scenes spiritually I would note is sometimes affected by our actions and what happens to the physical and certain other dimensional. I could feel energies of concussion, nausea and also certain kind trying shape what I have equated to the beginnings of certain tumor. Remember not believe in some of this but even if you do there are many different kinds of spiritual safeguards in letting know of this information and also in regards to reading this information.<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
