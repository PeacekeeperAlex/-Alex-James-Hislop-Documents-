<div class="title">(11/02/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Thought: <br><br>Activity:<br>- I have a certain kind of spotlight on me these days. I feel one of the things to have happened yesterday was a looking at what else is taking place on Earth. I felt a spirit of the cops come around me yesterday in which I was angry but not necessarily at them. In a vent area experience I get upset at times at the fact spiritually that they can&#39;t do certain things to protect me. It&#39;s a red tape unable to protect at times partially because a certain kind up above and out of jurisdiction make it difficult to protect in certain instances. It&#39;s like trying to ask the cope for help in the middle of spiritual battle, the way it looks can be how it seems and they sometimes are there to nullify certain aspects of the spiritual but should be equipped to do so given the kinds of spiritual turbulence I have noted. Some would try to say that the spotlight on me currently from what I gather from the spirit around me is some sort of ruse but I don&#39;t think it to be. I think spirit are watching but also I feel that they were watching even when I don&#39;t feel the spotlight. There is just this over boiling of upsetness at times in regards to things that have taken place within this process. Nobody want to talk about whether I got attacked or not and I can&#39;t seem to tell if it&#39;s because we talked so damn much about it or if some really don&#39;t want to address the issues. Either way one of the difficulties that emerged upon playing a certain video  game 9111 operator was that there are those spirit that pretend to be police and not necessarily within the content experience frameworks in which can be scary and some of it has to do with cultural normalities upon what kind of content experiences are kosher and considered the alternative to real life and you can see that if it has real life variables that crosses my line in that can be a problem. What becomes more of a problem is if people are forced to experience things behind the scenes upon some of those content experiences in which does not fit their criteria of what hey wanted to experience. Those cultural norms for some are not for others especially when we start to factor in variables of things we didn&#39;t want to experience within those content experiences. While addressing some these difficulties in regards to experiences there seems to be a crossing of lines upon which some are experiencing things they wanted to experience and then we have another group in which are experiencing things they didn&#39;t want to experience but for some understand it&#39;s a better alternative. It&#39;s unacceptable to be mixing these groups up within an authoritative position but within cultural practices we see these games come up where there seems to be good alternatives in which the collateral is misunderstood.<br>- writing systems, I have noted upon writing with pencil there to be certain kinds of writing systems in which exist some of which in regards to our own spiritual anatomy. Skills of writing in which on my end have been influenced to carrying degrees. One day I&#39;ll be able to write a full page without any hitches and the next it will be a different story, writer&#39;s block for some of it. Writer&#39;s block is spiritual I feel. I have observed there to be Spirit blocking thought and direction in regards to writing. Energies which feel like a blockage or blocking taking place which has felt to be almost similar to certain thought systems. There is also visuals in which I have noted in regards to writing. These ones feel old and classic, the kinds of visual imagery in association and the kind pertaining to writing. Soft visuals in which come to me and others at times upon reading. Like a snow storm outside of a library in which felt there to be not too many within the library itself, a solitude in regards to the library upon reading a certain chapter within Stephen King&#39;s It. It was a mixed scene from when the character of Ben was in the snowstorm and saw the clown. It was like this scenes was intermingled with another scene pertaining to when Ben was in the library. The visuals regarding are conjured up at times but that they already existed before seeing. I can think about certain fantasies and these visuals come fourth in which are similar which also lends credence to thought systems within writing and reading. What&#39;s is amazing about reading is that this visuals can feel like they venture fourth upon a certain scene without thinking about it. Like reading the words is a thought in of itself. Either way I have noticed that some of these thought systems, visual systems, and reading and writing systems have been put through the ringer at times. Like let know that certain kind invade space pertaining in which is not supposed to be utilized in such ways.<br>- There was a moment upon reading spiritual light by USB in which a discussion about Motion and a thought in regards to that there must be beings that exist that are motionless in which was further thought in regards to a theory that maybe only yhos located furthest behind the scenes or highest up could achieve that by way of certain Spirit not being able to augment that motionless. Another thought that maybe only a Original Creator could only achieve true motionless by way of the kinds of circumstances he has available to him. That one of the ways to correlate who is the Original Creator is to go with True motionless but I did sense to warn to be careful on that assumption. A thought and theory partially by way of those furthest being able to augment motionless from those in front of the scenes pretending to be the original creator if need be. <br>- Near the end of the day I have felt there to be changes on regards to my other dimensional. I felt like I hit home in the amount of productivity pertaining to myself which saw certain aspects of myself and others hit home as well. A big talking point is interaction pertaining and grouping and placement in regards to aspect of self and other kind in which might not have hit home in regards which I have known what that is to be. Imagine a higher self doing really well and then getting placed in an interaction area that is awesome but then another aspect of self not doing well and getting placed in a less than stellar area. How does that motivate to do well? It doesn&#39;t is the answer. Either way I feel there is talking points happening regarding and the bigger thing had to do with a utilization in regards to that in which is sometimes utilized again st those that do well and a threatening of all personal upon doing well from certain kind. I felt aspects get attacked upon making a mark like certain experiencing my life pertaining to shallow breathing, like I feel aspects of what some are experiencing in this life. Like when I breathe out it still feeling like shallow breathing for other kinds experience or what I think to be experiencing this life. Another big one was certain aspects of self and life utilization q well as fame coming around me from some trying to survive and also thrive as well as other nefarious in regards to actions sometimes in done on regards to others through this life. Like experiencing good life being a reasoning for certain action takin place. There is action attachment on regard to this life at times and some are claiming that t wasn&#39;t my action but someone else&#39;s in which is changing that s causing good will. Like my Argumentatives and chirping being a catalyst or something else. <br>- - Why is it that some spirit spend the goodwill quickly at times. Like some receiving different kinds of content experiences in which is good and interaction systems and the quick utilization regarding for some can be equated to wanting to experiencing in such a way.<br><br>(The common Spirit in those societies that are more brimstone and for some of them immoral)<br>(Those that have been with me in regards to me talking about defense works especially those reliant on me interacting and talking about defense)<br><br>Informational Placement:<br>Gaming, Health, Family, Preparation and Organization that my Main Spriit Guides indicated in regards to 2019 and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
