<div class="title">(05/15/2019) &quot;Robes&quot; </div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>Psychological continue this week and yesterday there multiple tells in form of spiders, some of which I had never seen before, I have seen small things here and there that were said to have been psychological tells that I have been attacked in larger manners, psychic flashes of spiders and sharks as well as psychic stimuli leading me to believe that I am under duress spiritually and psychic which yesterday there was tell that it is more than that. Within the themes of certain kind of shows I have noticed characters and people as well as events and timeline shaped in regards to interaction pertaining to myself and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides). I have seen qualities in regards to myself and my family in regards to some of the characters within Game of Thrones. There is this person and actor that has been brought up multiple times and I can&#39;t help but shake the feeling in regards to her aura and seemingly that she is related to certain processes that I am aware of, some of which ahs to do with the actors themselves. Archetypes and concepts were brought multiple times in regards to certain moments which potentially affected her and others(defined by my Main Camp) process. Something is also going on with faith today, a certain kinds of healing in regards to past events that had happened. <br><br>You have a film industry and behind the scenes spiritually there is multiple kinds of characters and interaction taking place in which some even in front of the scenes are unaware of by it&#39;s nature. There is multiple kinds of layers to this in which even certain portions of the spirit world are unawares of what some are doing in regards to certain kinds of film in their dimensional existence. There are also those awards in multiple kinds of forms. You have spiritually famous people within your society in which sometimes are not fully understood in the society that they can sense and recognize. Imagine that within certain movies there are those that some would be considered to be average joes that through fame and form utilization and how that interacts within society, like war heroes being within film as action stars and/or forms being able to be changes at will like clothing and the way that comes together with film can be interesting to see how it&#39;s weaved. Imagine that there are those that are famous in certain ways that are almost always in film by way of their fame and processes. You can see how form association and other kinds of association would be utilized in regards to this. For some societies those that are seemingly joes always being shoehorned in a spotlight could be aggravating in multiple kinds of ways. So within the wbe and weave of story in which connect multiple films that I have seen multiple tells to the universes of story connecting in multiple kinds of ways in which there is potentially a real aspect in regards to some. How some of those famous people, form and aspect utilization in regards would become recurring within story itself specifically in regards to certain pop culture where the fame of certain character potentially based off of these famous people would show up within certain content within certain society as recurring and potentially not so. I have noticed myself be a part of certain film behind the scenes partially having to be there because of whatever circumstances they were and there is a thing like that. A group of peoples ar part of film in regards to certain circumstances in certain society, for some almost forced to have to be there, it&#39;s like the directors and creators for some culture saying I wonder who shows up and who we have to deal with and the stark differences between ones in which are not like that and ones that are. There is aspects of that within hollywood filmmaking at times partially because of the amount of layers involved in film making. Where because of what I do and interact with the kind of content personal and not so in regards to that sort of things as well as the try outs of different content experiences and layers in regards to making it into the film itself as well as the stuff that makes it in anyhow depending on if there is that kind of filmmaking taking place. You could have a famous character with a similar form in regards to multiple kinds of story that can fit in multiple kinds of ways pertaining to different kinds of content in which is needed in regards to certain kinds of moments within film in which should not affect certain kinds of access and be used as an excuse. <br><br>Deaths and other kinds stolen from the Gods and Others(defined by my Main Camp) and how I and others(defined by my Main Camp) can repay in the manners that my Main Camp indicated.
