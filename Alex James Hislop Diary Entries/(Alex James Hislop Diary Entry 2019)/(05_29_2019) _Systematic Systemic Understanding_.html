<div class="title">(05/29/2019) &quot;Systematic Systemic Understanding&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- I created the (AJHD) Africa information and then I worked on some of my boards in the morning on the Peacekeeeperalex Trello Account.<br>- There was also someone brought up in regards to my past, one of my former teachers, symbolism in regards to the document I created pertaining to africa by way of the sun, this teacher reminds me of the sun in a certain aspect. She also reminds me of toughness and even chirpiness. She also reminds me a bit of my cousin in which continues to be brought up in certain manners. <br>- Yesterday a former teacher was also brought up but one of the focuses was on one of the actors in which more symbolism in regards to certain aspects of myself and my family was somewhat clear. It also reminded me of certain spiritualism in which I do sense that within this former teacher that still works at Black River. I didn&#39;t fully see it until now but she did remind me earlier on of Good Rock music and some of the symbolism in regards as well as the respect to show in regards to some of those that have fought for our freedoms. She also reminds me of remembrance. <br>- Mass Retrogression Board updates and recording the Mass Retrogression Issue Discussion Broadcast Material (1)<br>- Let know of multiple kinds of stuff taking place at times. There is certain systems that potentially exist in regards to past interaction and present interaction as well as future interaction, where someone could do something in the future to potentially affect the present, and the present the past as well as other variations. You see something that take place past that makes sense in the present by way of certain interaction that affected the past. Like someone saying something in a process interaction to make someone dislike you in which interact with past that affected the past as well as someone saying in the future in which potentially impact the present as well as other kinds of variations. The power play between past, present and future in which exists must be interesting to note especially when you put different self variables in the mix. <br>- Another let know was that certain people with short temper and irritation difficulties could be certain spirits in which are trying to survive of certain systems that affects the mentality and emotions as well as behaviour of some in which is more heightened behind the scenes but because of interaction there is some of the discomfort and irritation buffered by way of some experiencing some of the irritation and anger even if it only felt inute in stimuli could mean the difference for someone that is experiencing it in certain ways. So, for example, you could have a physical that has a short temper in which is experiencing said behaviour, mentality, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) by way of spiritual interaction in which that spiritual interaction could partially be certain systems behind the scenes saving certain spiritual entities in which exist that utilizing certain systems to survive by way of certain immorality promotion. The idea that some need to promote immorality to survive exists, think of it in the context of food and drink rather than an ethical alignment. <br>- There was talk about different kinds of people again at times in relation to certain processes, one was in regards to a dark type adult film star earlier in the in which potentially had to do with changes happening in regards to certain adult frameworks pertaining to physical planet earth,<br>- There was also talk of different characters  in regards to the show House MD, one of which was correlation in regards to some of the things within in my process relating to some of my other-dimensional doctors and health practitioners and administration. I realized and identified certain qualities in regards to those characters in which sort of lamented upon the contrasting lines of the things that affect those Characters and what they are specifically in regards to people affecting how those Characters are Shaped and not so. There was this subtle tell that some of the Character do Care about Earth in certain ways as well as the Culture that they are born from.<br>- Another let know though earlier was that in which says that not all Characters have to have a certain kind of literal life and can still can be just as good as if tf there was life. The thought of certain Characters being created by way of Expression, Art, Content Experiences, etc.(defined by my Main Camp), some of which might be a desirable life and the scary thought that all characters have to have a quality of life in certain regards. The stories in which certain characters are created would be different and some would say potentially dull, not that there is anything wrong with dull but there are those that crave a certain kind of story. People still write story and create through expression and other kinds so there must be ways to facilitate those characters in which are vitally needed in some instances pertaining to certain story without having to have certain spirits and other kinds of beings living lives in which they did not want too or in which certain are uncomfortable approving. What are the way? <br>-Nicotine Spirits and the hookup access in regards to what my mian Camp indicated as well as better alternative to make it through to where my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>- Events happened <br><br>Documents Created: <br>(AJHD) Africa<br>(AJHD) Villain Defense <br><br>Content Creation: <br>(AJHD) Mass Retrogression Issue Discussions Broadcast Material (1)<br><br>Advocationals:<br>Those places in regards to catching the attention of someone higher up where your culture changes upon a certain kinds of fame emerging. <br>Those Dark ones that have fallen. <br>Purchasing of story and access to be able to experience lives with those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>Access in regards to those hookups to be able to experience the kinds of lives that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Especially in regards to the kinds of immorality that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>Transportation systems to alleviate some of the strain and stress on the incarnation systems in regards to the Areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>Sex Disclaimers and what the hell is happening spiritually especially in regards to those able to utilize spiritual sex mechanisms behind the scenes in regards to their dimensional live existences. <br>Form software in regards to hollywood in regards to print out aesthetics and features. Two actors that look different, one playing the young version that looks abit different and the technology to map out what exactly would be needed to make the young actors look more like the older actor but young as well as vice versa, if possible in a way in which is comfortable for the actors. <br>Actor and Defense segway frameworks<br>Emergency systems and Apocalyptic Broadcast construction and access<br>Memory Supportworks <br>Mind Teams, Korin Teams, Body language Teams, Other-dimensional Teams in regards to Alex James Hislop and others(defined by my Main Camp) Content that my Main Camp indicated. <br>Character Rights and CHaracter Holdings of Traits, Mechanisms, Qualites, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) for people and spirit in regards to the Time frames that my Main Camp indicated *****<br>Guidance and Protection in regards to the Handing of resources in regards to when Alex James Hislop and others(defined by my Main Camp) update their defensives information, for myself and others(defined by my Main Camp) specific to the AJH Daily Defensives and what my Main Camp indicated.
