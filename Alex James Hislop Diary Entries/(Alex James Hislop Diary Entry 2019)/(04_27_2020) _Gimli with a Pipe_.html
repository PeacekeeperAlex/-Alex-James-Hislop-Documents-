<div class="title">(04/27/2020) &quot;Gimli with a Pipe&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Quote:<br>&quot;Be loyal to your future for your past&quot;<br>- Anon<br><br><br> Activity:<br>The start of the day a bit rocky for consideration of who you are might be matters most. Here and there tells of not going to affect but upon recollection given the ability might give the tell. Do we allow and swallow the pills of the ones and groups that would layeth the roadwork for future so said not going to affect yous and when does the remembrance even with discretion hatch plots of quality of life. When does it bite you in ways upon previous thought of better outcomes. A spiritual movement and group said to be attacking the bad albeit I do feel spiritual are protected given reason but also ominous maneuverings to give way to that lack of memory upon vindication in which the look who what where done it after the fact and during seems not to cut the right brand of alleviation. The missing upon the climax hope not to be in ill celebration seems to still miss the mark upon the silence that shouldn&#39;t truly be, not for true. Maybe it&#39;s the silence itself that saves most often given the respectabilities well met but sometimes it speaks of something missing. Even in silent. Do I, not given what I know and remember and understand to be go the way of allowance for a better day, even if the better day happens to be surviving and not experiencing the pain and hardship and what of the others that I both care and loathe not always the same who would lay claim in which is also trying to stave upon the better day, but also upon my decisions and choices at times also having nothing to do with my direction as well, for my choices in providing a better be limited to allowance of something said not to be dark and sinister of future, or was it just my future. This need be ways of operating how could it ever have gotten to the point of need be better than the Gold Rule of Religions depicted on this planet. You don&#39;t think there is a cleaned up version in which they speaks of ultimately located in higher, lower and middle places of virtue? The answer is that there is and many say the wordings suffice for what given meaning relayed. While there are those that would play hard to follow and embellish in the finer details in which the meaning surpasses by way of truth. What is the decision upon such descript and portrayal of other seemingly hands force in a presence that already existed in this process even in minute detail and to think that would be the first appearance seems to be quite fitting of rebuke. For you see there was earlier time frame and has been earlier time frames of both let knows and fallacies to force not to mention story but also other kinds in which I myself have been privy in a certain manner to other kinds in which some find to be justifiable given reasoning of not being able to operate upon my discretion of experiencing quality of life. Does the nitty gritty of what one wants to experience not matter upon the always must matter and proven to be especially upon the upper class for if  not of the upper class, powerful and famous what would it be then? The small normal man might as well be a Jedi with reason lest the purpose be lost and not worth reason. For if not reason of self what do we have especially upon the younger which might be why the will and words of such an order exists in the first place. For as revered as the Yellow Light sabered sentinel might be it has come to the attention at times that foul called might not be what it seems. Was the earlier fowel that called upon truth, the same colour as that saber as I know it to be or was it just justification another colour of the gold yellow pressed upon with good and sincere reasoning. For even when hour is not growing late such an action can matter and doesn&#39;t have to matter even upon the asking of what kind of harm had been perpetuated not even from the call upon the play itself but rather from vagabonds of past virtue. Gosh darn for exclamation upon the god damn of the small intellectual pretender I am to be but might have real in my vains. When did we have to consult the stars to be as sun as we could be? There something someone said that I am fun, and I even responded back saying I could be more fun if I was allowed to be as fun as I could be. Compared to the spiritual of actuality, I seem to be left wanting at times even if my chicken scratch makes the cut. Don&#39;t think it&#39;s not know the involvement that some are trying perpetuate in regards to myself being involved with things that are so far above my head that regardless of whether I flew or not would I ever make the peak to be that Holy Man on a Mountain half shut down in the Middle. Because they have tried to label me that and I have tried to be that and I continue to let know and go the direction I do in which doesn&#39;t always lend to cover if there ever was concept both garnered and not upon the cray cray ways that exist within the spirit, thank god for such ways. I am supposed to be dang you wasn&#39;t suppose to be the famous last words of a barely failed poet not for lack of failing mind you. How did they whippersnap my buffoonery and lovability even if grimey and misunderstood lonely heart into the false professor of virtue  and stand ability. Especially when this life might have been supposed to look as a plane trip back home from the wilds of way high up top civility. Who have I become to be so encroached and enamored by my fame light upon the devastation seemingly. It brings it to one of those points I remember where fame utilization for reasoning of certain dark actions being present which I always thought there to be a darker that exists upon those directions for if not who protected but fame. Is it the average that deserves the attention and the famelight for there are those sadness that exist in which didn&#39;t the kind of powerful that exist amongst the average spiritual. You put innocence and it&#39;s the same colour as fame at times, albeit light and more yellow. Maybe it was that sentinel that protected the innocence even if in neutral manner. I don&#39;t believe there should those who have to give up the civilities in life that make it worth living even past those lines of what it used to be upon always saving if need be and for some it not having to worry about it. That speaks of fanaticism for the good life and some vilify those means upon actions attachment when someone wont give up there cigar for good reason. For if you can&#39;t even fart without causing some kind of damage that at what point do you call a different kind of foul that reminds of such. Of course true good kind that exists can but do we dare during such review of ways and realization upon the fantastically reemerged sensibilities of the past. How easily seen the ways of being able to pull an excuse fashionably seen upon some of the darker and even lighter reasonings for things of existence and ways of the world stark for what it is for some but not nearly so for others could we employ upon the reasoning within this process. Of course upon truth and escape because of truth at what point do those reasonings need to be employed anyhow given Gimli with a pipe for reason. The senses of what this process is are understood in a fashion both let known and not so but my inner Gandalf insists at times and isn&#39;t the tragedy of life that it seems to be upon the spiritual turbulence and conflict, as well as actions that have nothing to do upon my own in which drives justification into the mix. It&#39;s interesting reaction upon the prison wardens half still under construction to discern and gauge the winds of whether I should be locked in the bin. Be careful though for Oh Captain my Captain called upon the desks of learning upon the kind that would study such miraculous, evident and strange ways of the Crazy and insane would be one of the ways I would rally. Construction never looked so confused as those they try to wall in. Those gauging whether they be good or not never looked more conflicted as well at times. Of course for the darker type at what point do you not understand the circumstance that exists for those who are crazy and dark, the ultra good as well as having something in common upon the grief and remembrance of what needs to be, could the course of action be to just label as something misunderstood and blatantly looked past for safe reasoning of present? Easy? It&#39;s not an easy life at times and it isn&#39;t not just remembered but also forgotten on purpose. The levels on meter of when need be lend fourth assistance sometimes read well. At what point do we not extend justification to something in which has caused harm upon innocence not just the boiling point of never again but also the quality of life as such both in the bin of such circumstances and broken free. The psychictivity Observed this day has been quick movements and the feeling like somebody is doing something behind my back but then again it might be in plain site. Even the True Good emergence lines of how I have been proceeding, really vehemently since the eighth of April, 2020 seems to have had the winds in the sails be revoked. Isn&#39;t it ironic that the virtue at times of the Good Silent maneuvering would be employed to provide context as to why that is. There was quick flashes earlier yesterday night in which felt to be alien in nature. I had not fully understood what was taking place but psyche and other dimensional infrastructure affected. It was like a white light, and alien figure walking towards me. Of course another psychitivity and lot in life analyzation happens to be that in which is taking place upon the fold of self and other kinds of blinders in which hiding what might be and is detested to be of truth in certain circles. I do think some of it is crap and some of it is also some trying to have it have happen. Trying to create certain variables to manifest through not only my writing but also through other kinds as well. How does one fold a section of the soul as to what some are experiencing behind the scenes to quarantine aspects of self? How does one forget that what is experienced by self even while sectioned off really does matter. 100% of what you consider yourself to be with 1% sectioned off from a certain kind of percentage of yourself experiencing experiences and how do those experiences truly matter for the other 99% and especially that 1% beloved. And at what point does it not end because of the amount of terror, difficulties and bloodshed for the amount of reason enough to exist, when does it stop, which questions are you asking, enough beating around bush here folks but the truth is the kind of Spiritual talking points, intelligence and coherency in the conversations not to know a lot of the truth.<br><br>and need a lot of the things to survive upon the bringing fourth of what it has been but an understanding write down of would happened and did happen upon the amount of percentages involved in the entire thing? Wouldn&#39;t you want to know if you were one of the true good higher up communities similar style of understanding and knowing even in a earth-based physically grimey but the advanced upon of know and the ways that were known. <br><br>Activity: <br>#Interaction #Covert #MilitaryRecords #Debenair #Aristocratic #Intellectual<br>#AverageJoeSensibilities.</div>
