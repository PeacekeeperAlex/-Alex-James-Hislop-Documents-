<div class="content">Activity: <br>- Again the trying to streamline events and active events through my process. Attacked upon walking into the next room, a molding happening of the break when I went into the room across from the computer room. Attacked in the leg areas and what I have discerned as certain kind of infrastructure in regards to myself, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s chakras. I went for a swim yesterday as well upon asking multiple times and given the go ahead. They also attacked other things as well, discernable pain coming from my lower area from my legs attached to my torso area being attacked. Not only that but the kinds of things insinuated to have been happening to other aspects of myself in which I felt discernable recompense and spirits on my side upon some of the things happening.<br><br>- This process Changed. I discerned multiple kinds of attacks yesterday in regards to myself in which changed the interaction in regards to my process in many different ways. Something changed higher up and there is multiple different kinds happening today. Some of the resource upon waking up was those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to the care, compassion kindness crowds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, basically the good guys, taking over the reigns in a certain capacity in regards to interaction in regards to my process. Laxing and talking is what we want to go for with emphasis that advocations and other kinds exist throughout, hybrid style without defensive and argumentative tones in which I am advocating for hookup exchanges in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in which were holding down the defensive and argumentative tones in regards to myself the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I stood on earth for about an hour in the front yard while sitting in my lawn chair which I basically just brought certain things up in a relaxed way as well as hookup in regards to my voice being situated. Seeing it from the one point of view is danging in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, cleaning up some of the things in regards to the advocationals, situating the advocationals and all the while me letting know of defense every two seconds as well as all the other stuff as well. There was many different talks had in regards to some of the different kinds of activity going on in my process. as well as the potential changes taking place in this process. There was also let know that certain peoples in certain imeline life, literal timeline track were attacked insinuated to be in regards to my Father Alan Hislop but I am not certain that&#39;s true. Although, I think it might have been in regards to my own as I have noticed different aspects of myself, doppelgangers and defensives emerge in which reminds of those working on my life in different kinds of capacities. <br><br>- In regards to what I consider myself in regards to this marking, advocation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, how many god sparks deployment has there been? More than what was deployed before my incarnation as Alex James Hislop Fenbo44 and Others(defined by my Main Camp) in the manners that my Main Camp indicated?<br><br>I was near the fridge when I noticed this black spot, almost like an iris eye. This black iris seemed like a temporal orb when the stimuli pointed towards my emotional areas which felt like things were being sucked in here and there in which when I laid upon my bed in my bedroom, it felt like it was situated to something in which almost had personality although that might not be the case. Again multiple stimulus in regards to this storyline might not necessarily be pointing towards the same thing. Either way it was insinuated that somehow when I love towards this black orb in which felt intertwined in regards to my emotional infrastructure that the love would go towards Jamie Hart that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. It was also then insinuated that it would go towards another person the next day in regards to my myself, my other-dimensional selves, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides). I feel this could help in multiple regards.  Multiple storyline let knows and different dimensional interaction with in front of the scenes kind of imagination. I felt process changes as potentially that love reaching Jamie Hart that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Another let know was that of certain groups that some to have potentially mistaken Jamie Hart to be a part of, one of which happens to do with a silk black and/or wet black impressions as well as dark water impressions. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for clarifications in regards to this the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There was a wet black impression group in which has been mislabelled at times as wanting to experience certain things in which was not the truth. Just because certain groups like to experience certain kinds of immorality doesn&#39;t mean it should be mislabelled as something in which it is not. <br>- Different kinds of crazy imaginations and other kinds seen today with insinuations as to where my Imagination mechanisms, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) have been. It&#39;s a good question. <br>- Channel woes continued today in which I have discerned certain kinds of conflict in regards to multiple groups away from my process. There is also certain kinds of group in which are taking certain kinds of ripple affect backlash by way of process changes, this is a big priority to help situate in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>-  I went with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding the love and loving towards the seemingly Black Transportation Orb.<br><br>-Upon waking I have felt diminished upper body strength in which is healing. Then certain memories of the past were brought up to a certain degree in which I thought maybe had something to do with what had happened in some of the dreams, Angelics. I felt like I had made peace but then they also let know that there were those trying to attack and potentially vent aggression through me in certain dreams especially in regards to the continued storyline that some of myself is going to attack in which I don&#39;t fully feel is the case in the ways that my Main<br><br>Advocationals: <br>(AJHD) Godosoin<br>(AJHD) Black Communication Orbs<br>(AJHD) Black Transportation Orbs<br>(AJHD) Dorota<br><br>(AJHD) AJH Freedom Teams<br>(AJHD) God Spark Retrieval<br><br>Document Name Scheme:<br>[Earth-Based]<br>[Physical]<br>Number Tags &amp; ID<br>Timeline Groupings name in regards to my Timelines that my Main Camp indicated.<br> Name in regards to the Areas of the Original Light that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light.<br>Name in regards to the Original Dimensional Areas that my Main Camp indicated in the Original Light. <br>Defensives Advocations in regards to Capsules<br>Energy Placement<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for psychological defense in regards to physical Earth-Based Digital, especially the internet the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>---<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
