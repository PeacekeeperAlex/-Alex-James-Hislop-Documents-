<div class="title">(08/30/2019) &quot;Escalation Point Square&quot;</div>
<div class="content">- I felt something get taken from my psychictivty and sight, something was cut and there are certain spirits saying it is decent and I do feel a certain kind of healing but somehow I don&#39;t think it&#39;s decent, on one hand I can see figures and flashes in my right eye and another thing there are some blaming my psychictivty and saying that is to blame for some of the things within my process. I choose what my main Spirit guides indicated. Others that my main Spirit guides choose what my main Spirit guides indicated. My eyes feel healed but I am not certain, something wastl taken perspective wise and my psychictivty affected, how see the spirit was affected and I can feel certain lenses and perspective at times, live of eyes move into face area where certain movers and shakers of dimensions are moving certain perspective.<br><br>- I looked towards stars yesterday and there was a moment where a part of my sight was looking towards still when I looked away in which is not new but something about those star a communicational w. Not long after I would feel I would get attacked by some throwing certain thing that I and others that my main spirits guides indicated supposedly did and then supposedly my inner child got attacked in a certain manner. The interaction ranged from talking about some of the conflict taking place<br><br>- How much do astetics matter? Being able to look the way we want too and even when a small astetics change could be change in direction. Like being labelled something that your not in which partially shaped certain interaction. <br><br>- Healing power of nature I talked about and I have noticed there seems to be something that nature does to humans at times in which feels like a Spirit healing us and I wondered about what it was that humans brought to the table in regards to Nature.<br><br>Another thing happened yesterday where someone commented upon a certain kind revealing themselves in a certain way pertaining to certain Joe&#39;s and earth based, some of which having to do with. Physical earth based humans. There is something I am noting, psychictivty in regards to certain earth based regular humans and others having powers in being located higher up, the Psychctivity changes in myself lament upon to a certain degree the kind of power exists, father away, wide ranging, higher vibrations in that what some supposedly non-psychic humans and the stimuli experiencing noting upon the moving of vibrations and moving upwsrdness of my experience in which has been to told hold power but there is a catch. It&#39;s not always his way on regards to certain earth based physical humans and some of it is I feel, and in the mix their are those trying to create this to be partially by way of protecting earth based<br> The one thing in regards to myself is that I am still a psychic able to discern energies like b ing able to note everyday life of what some humans experience while still retaining certain abilities, I looked at my psychictivty changes and felt upset, while I do like some of the changes and healing, there is still some psychictivty affected. I choose what my Main Spirit guides indicated for us to choose.<br><br>- Another thing affected is a certain kind of flirting sometimes passive in some of the responses I do in regards to situations presented, one of the things in regards to mine anyhow is a real desire bot to make some uncomfortable bad what was discerned in regards of some of in regards to certain system is that a certain flirtation is still desirable and helps in which I agree with in which shouldn&#39;t be mistaken for wanting people to feel uncomfortable. <br><br>-Multiple kinds of storylines evolving as the night continued, I was on the defensive for most of the night, not too much argumetnatives but one of those situations where I could discern conflict on my end evolving to a point where there was a bit of a snowball. Again the kind of stuff that I was discerning was intense story where the things physicals spoke of corresponded with certain spiritual happening. Some of it Feng shuied o some of the ininuation in regards to what the spirit was saying.<br><br>- They said they attacked me in a certain way. They tried to attack some of my family and friends and the kind of overlaps that were coming around me were said to be that kind in regards to my incarnation. They said I might have been forced to jump into this life and in a certain context potentially but if I was the bad guy it might have not have been the big bad guy and in fact I don&#39;t think it was but the truth I feel is that I am actually good. They continue to say that there was fighting over this life in a certain manner pertaining to certain dimensional incarnation but if there wasn&#39;t in regards to the physical driver then it might have been simple and if it was simple some point towards it being before this life some of the conflict involved.<br>- Another kind trying to attack certain loved ones in regards in which there was certain revelation before I arrived here and a lot of legal and spotlight involved in which for some is still located on them in which doesn&#39;t make much sense. Some were playing some future overlaps in which I don&#39;t want certain power being taken away if possible pertaining to those futures. <br>- There was certain so said revelation in regards to some of my family members and there was streamlining of events yesterday partially because of some of the events happening higher up in which I can discern. The shoehorning of events based upon my interaction in regards to reaction of the spirit around myself isn&#39;t new.<br>- One of things that happened is Main Spirit Guides groups got shaken up a bit but I feel my Main Spirit Guides have been set for a while now, some of it literally moving past certain areas where some Main Spirit Guides in regards to certain kind were fighting for them especially to still be guiding some of them.<br>- There was battle in regards to certain Main Spirit Guides and some of the let know during certain moments felt like high impact bit also mixed with other kinds. Battles in regards to ocean deployment off of an interaction and thing fantastical like that in which might have been true in a certain context as there might have been certain deployment from physical wildlife in the Oceans as that was what was insinuated.<br>- Another thing seen was how simplistic the life of Jesus was in regards to some of the gameplan and kind of hitting home that happened upon certain kind of events, one of which was Suarez and chilling outs reminiscent of the 60s that took place. <br>- Some of the interaction happening in regards to physical interaction with myself and my family. One of the things mentioned this day was the idea that some went lazy meaning in this context that certain effort stopped for reasoning of certain streamlining and tells as to what this is but I think some of tvwas a ruse and I think it was partial streamlining in which might have fractured certain kinds of direction at least in regards to when and if other kinds join that kind of direction and life path. The kinds of things I discern from certain<br>- They have shaped certain demeanors at times based upon how myself and others would respond in situations to scare at times and say we are the same people in which is partially not true but still symbolism and story regarding in which makes it earrie.<br>- They said a certain kind had to give up going after one of my family members in which at times has been a bit of a thing, some of the let knows in regards to some of difficulties and different direction having to have had take on this.<br>- Let&#39;s make one thing clear, there were screwups this days and people were called. Multiple implosions in which changed certain direction.<br>- I could myself changing and othe aspects of myself trying to formulate how I am going to continue in this life. My information still only pertains to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light.<br>- Multiple inner aspects, the inside of my head dimensional felt like an aware glove, inner selves having realization and understanding as well as all personal having similar awakenings. Multiple kinds of dimensional stimuli were felt and some of which was psychic attack in certain moments but I am wondering what behind the scenes.<br>- There was a moment where it went earth based and this place and certain aspects of Saskatchewan has such clean and open energies that it can be a change of pace in regards to this process and I can discern and inter with higher energies or so it feels at times,not to say that hasn&#39;t been at 42 Franklin Beach road and others, but just that it seems to be all over the province a certain kind of clean energy.<br>- I felt like my life path changed and I became more relaxed, enjoying life more especially considering what some said to have done to me in regards to this day. I am not certain if it&#39;s a dialing because I did discern that I was protected and I do feel that was the case in a certain manner. They don&#39;t own my life for me being saved though but they do deserve resources and compensation those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>- Some tried to blame me this day partially by way of survival but at what point do I feel that that has been too much in which I can&#39;t do anything but continue on and defend myself and others at times. I am still doing advocation, testifications and disclaimers and there was defensive informations deployed in regards. My family feels a certain way because they have an even stingers case than me for some of them. Even though the other probably have even better defense at times than myself partially by way of what evolved to this endeavours. I felt certain authorities done yesterday and even on my side of things shaken. Future and present stuff as well as past in which was circling the fruition.<br>- Some were also trying to accelerate past to also situate the acceleration that has been happening in this process.<br>- I think there were certain kind that were at a loss and it kind of felt like big chess pieces moving in a certain context as well as higher up selves stuff happening his day. <br>- I had asked Angels to read my Main Spirit Guides information in which then cause an increase of tide on a certain end in which the devil disliked, I displayed clarification and did reputational defense jnformations but some jumped onto that on as an excuse for what happened. I then continued with certain ligtv discussions and loving which I had been doing throughout the day in which further agitated some by way of how things would be labelled and play out.<br><br>#Upates #Change #Family #Story #Interaction #System #Travel #Future #LifePath #AlexJamesHislop #Truth #Safety #AccelerationAndDecelerationInformation #Family #Party #Sask #Day2 #Jesus #Oceans #MountEverest #PersonalIncarnationAttack #HigherUpAttack #Resources #Streamlining #Trouble #ConflictManagement #Angels #LightDiscussions<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
