<div class="title">(10/17/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Mood: <br>Silent, Optimistic, <br>Quote: <br>At the touch of Love everyone becomes a poet.<br>-Plato<br><br>Horoscope:<br>Today you hit the ground running. You&#39;re happy, energetic, and optimistic. You feel love for all mankind. Don&#39;t be surprised if this brings new people into your life. You can&#39;t blame them for wanting to be around you. You&#39;re looking as good as you feel. You can feel the eyes following you as you walk down the street. Enjoy the attention!<br><br>HoroscopeActualiy: <br>I feel some of earth have been shoehorned here and some in which have chosen to be here at times partially because of some of the routes that certain spirit have gone in approach in regards to this process and the events taking place. I am laughed at the looking good as you feel horoscope comment but these days spiritually i don&#39;t feel too bad but maybe that isn&#39;t true. <br><br>Activity:<br>- I woke up today and it&#39;s been a bit of a  general occurrence these days to wake up with a devastated energy feeling from the nights events. There also seems to be something going on with certain kind that I defend at times having to do with immorality promotion. Some say that if they attack then I shouldn&#39;t be defending them but just because you promote immorality doesn&#39;t mean that you shouldn&#39;t receive defense. Within the confines of a certain culture there seems to be conversation about some of this in regards to being able to defend a certain kind especially those that are of banner culture and do have nations and things of that nature. There was also a tell about Water and smoothness this day, a certain kind. Might have had to do with choosing certain choices and not compromising in regards to certain topics and themes. Discussions of defense and holding it down protocols in regards to certain kind of Spirit not being in the vicinity, most notably the anti-camp kind, potentially a conflict or mediation taking place. Continued let know of something to do with intimacy. More discussion about me showing up or someone covering for certain events in the future. I kind of feel that there needs to knowing about some of this stuff because I don&#39;t want it to hit me in the head in the future. <br>- A certain kind of culture where certain stipulation on either side happens, like one side doesn&#39;t have a certain variable and the other not able to say a certain variable. The kinds of conflict management and conflict that takes place, I have noticed this culture at times and there seems variations of this culture in which in order to help situations choose certain circumstances and modifiers in certain dimensional existences. Sometimes this isn&#39;t the case though for some of them, sometimes there is some getting forced to live life in certain ways in which is impacting. <br>- It was interesting that there was spirit in which said that the Light or at least certain kind of Light want to focus on creative endeavors and not necessarily protecting, it was said in a certain manner though in which certain kinds of light existences disagreed. It&#39;s two-fold because certain light existences would rather not have to defend day in and day out in a certain manner but multiple light existences are defending in multiple capacities. <br>- I have a perception of God. These perception I feel are living life. They hold power upon which we also lend power by way of how we perceive. There is those shapes of perception in which exist that have lent towards what we perceive. Think of this, you have a perception of a certain person, that perception is partially shaped upon experiences that you have had but you don&#39;t fully remember actually shaping that perception to reflect the imagery that comes upon thinking about that perception. There are those artists and shapers and expanders as well as creators in regards to perception that literally impact and influence the imagery and stimuli in what we experience pertaining to what we have labelled perception. Now, perception also impacts other kinds of places, imagine a wall of art representing a portion and potentially more so of someones perception in which is experienced in a different way. Like in some other dimensional existence is seen in a certain manner and that how we perceive affects those dimensional existences in a certain way. I have been change this perception to a certain extent in different ways. So upon my perception of God, I thought of him answering to those that my Main Spriit Guides indicated in the Original Light, I changed him to reflect what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light and I also put certain being in vicinity with him, some spirit channeled through and said old friends. <br>- There was a story line brought up that my father could have been a certain kind of happiness and maybe even aspects of Solar Systems Sun. There was another one though about anger and that colour that reminds me of my father. Faded Orange like a sunset Orange. Some have lamented that this might have meant that he has near the end of a certain work cycle in which he put fourth but another talked about was Anger. That he might have been angry in the past and the sunset colour being a reflection of not being angry anymore or so we think. Some of the insinuations in this life have made me wary about some of the things that have happened. He is not supposed to be attacked and there are other insinuations of being of Higher Light. There was something took pace this past coupe days in regards to certain fathers where someone tried to say that they were bad when they were not. <br>- As soon as I did informational creation there has been a switch up happen in a certain manner where certain spirits are less cordial and more antagonistic but really its much more expansive than that. How is it that all of a sudden that spirit changes to try and pursue aggressive intimacy in a certain manner in which some would just consider rape upon certain actions of mine. It&#39;s not just that though, it&#39;s literally trying to kill, Totrure, harm and hunt certain kind. Some in which have nothing to do with me. <br>- The interaction changed in regards to certain Spirit, there has been emphasis in regards to <br>- Earlier there was a time mechanism reminiscent to earlier this process this year where time mechanism slowed down where It felt like I was on a long time interval smoother and slower. It felt like a machinery stuttering behind the scenes and stopping, where a facilitation of psychic stimuli regarding changed.<br>- I felt a certain process get saved from turbulence seemingly linked to earlier events within the past couple days in which saw high tide within my process.<br>- There was multiple moments near the end of the day in which saw certain kind implode in direction, certain spiritual attacks and certain direction has seen a change at times in interaction. This lead towards tense moments near the end of the day in which saw multiple Spirit claim that somehow mine and others mundane actions were at fault.<br>- Early morning culture similar to physical in spiritual  was brought up. Transportation stimuli and a movement of infrastructure from myself, it felt like my other dimensional in front of the scene skin was pushed upwards and I moved and certain infrastructure was left behind on the bed area, I am not certain if it&#39;s going to be put back but I am wondering where a portion of my other dimensional anatomy or at least what I felt to be went.<br>- I had a vision in which felt real, I moved towards a sports car through the engine like a ghost in which settled into female form. I felt with extra sensory a window to my right, and I felt I was wearing jeans and also some sort of spikey equipment on my chest area. There was a man next too me but he looked like a Trex, the Trex tried to kiss me and it felt a Trex just small down to the size of raptor. I then did Callwords knowing getting this person to know what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. This experience got grabbed, this stimuli and experience seemed to be pushed into my head area. I discerned only this time I used the Callwords for the extra sensory touch I was experiencing. For a second I though I was on a beach and I think I was with a female, I felt air, though something told me she looked dark. Another stimuli I felt on my lap was female with cargo pants in high teemed to different with the vision on the beach.
