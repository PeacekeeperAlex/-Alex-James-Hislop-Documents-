<div class="title">(12/12/2019) God Spark</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>What are these Other-Dimensions I am able to sense as a Physical Psychic-Medium? I can feel trust realms by way of the action of trust. It&#39;s discerned at times by myself as a light white blue and Trust like others I will list is a real action that can be done by place trust, certain energy placements in which can classically be done in the head area. There is also though the chest area machinisms in which is hooked up to our breathing at times in which when exhaling a spiritual machinism in regards to trust bodies that can compact inwards upon utilization creating trust. Think of a placement of a spiritual shoe pump in your chest area in which you can moving inwards and outwards with breathing that creates spiritual trust and transportation in which can be done in regards to other physical humans, looking at someone and trusting with that spiritual anatomy and mechanisms can create bonds. I discern Trust energies to be classically white in regards to earth-based I have noted some of these energies also to be brown and actually some pointed them out to me in a certain capacities. I also discern there to be a relation with forgiveness. It might be different but I feel it also might be of similar realms. Forgiveness I can do as well as a literal action we all can and <br><br>-(There were multiple Groups of Spirit and Gods that came around me early morning in the porch are entrance while looking a particular spot on my mirror. One had to do with an aspect of God and the Original Creator. Another had to do with an aspect of Self. There was a third when I pointed towards certain kinds of peripherals and other dimensional in regards to this process. I said I was going with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. These spirit whooped ass and it&#39;s the real truth. It kinds of felt like I was combined with a certain kind of power and it might have been the cover that certain spirit was playing these events to a certain degree. The real truth being is that some are attacking and for some how they defend is from the top. One of the big ones had to do with clarifications in regards to how I combine and take God Spark. It stems from the aspect of the Original Creator that can take back God Spark, all if he truly wanted to and he has the power to do so or at least can retrieve the Power if he wanted too. I do it decent, the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.) <br>- (The day before was supposedly about Anger and that it was supposedly done decent except that psychological holdings on certain other dimensional selves and things of that nature saw a certain kind of spirit channeling through in which spoke that my Main Spirit Guides wouldn&#39;t sanction certain kinds of endeavors especially that in which went after a storyline having to do with going after certain kinds of elders. The key difference would be what? And how would they respond should the things that have happened to me and my family happened to them. Either way there were spirit that hit their buttons on certain storylines this day. Might not have been the anger one and it might have been the sadness one. It spoke of certain kind trying to move something, certain kind of other dimensional anatomy. There was also awakenings, inner consciousness combining and awakening, that in which might have already been combined in a certain manner.)<br>-( I went to Tim Horton&#39;s with Motivation but left taking the day off, To be true, by the time I left town and into home on Metro I had started walking towards the callwords that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. Some were saying that somehow my Main Spirit Guides left people behind on this point but I am not certain, doesn&#39;t sound to be for some.)<br>- (When I played Halo 3 I sense some stuff happen days before. There was movement of infrastructure and things of that nature. There was also a spirit of blue that was trying to say something but it ended up getting corrected. We looked at Master Chief and ask him some questions for one. He felt a certain way but even more so the Artist&#39;s vision spoke of something. The bigger was a spirit of Higher Light letting know of something yet again that some that some got it wrong. I played Fallout and there was this clean energy utilization that potentially had to do with the third but some looked at new vegas. It was also said that this clean energy had been scooping but I am not certain and then it was also insinuated around the same times as discussion pertaining to dimensional in which had been deployed in regards to myself and others in which I don&#39;t if it&#39;s that either. Either way the next of playing would bring fourth a certain kind in which some said then this is all this is. I kind of looked towards gaming and said what the heck as well because I have had my fair share of dimensional building off of turbulence but there is also that deployments beforehand based on just in cases and also other kinds. How many more decent things that can facilitate certain kind have been deployed by way of certain bigs. Why can&#39;t we have a greed coverage plan in regards to certain interaction and other kinds, One covers all or if need be two but I don&#39;t want to go to three because of certain variables, I still go with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Then a deployment of dimensions around myself to facilitate interaction in the ways that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. I played Cultists Simulator and that felt like Mysticism and Story dancing. Really amazing story moments while playing and I feel that someone else was facilitating the mysticism. There is other themes as well. I play Mass Effect 3 and of course there was moments. It felt like certain kinds of specters came around me in a certain manner but it seemed to be of the kind of Good vs Evil on Planet Earth to be true, that&#39;s how it was partially discerned anyhow. One of things that was spoken of was the kind of tetherment in regards to gaming. Like a being with memory and awareness off of content in which I see his perspective at times in regards to some of it because I used to have a memory in regards to certain content experiences in which was modified and partially stolen but I still have portions in which identifies certain events by way of content experiences and things of that nature. I used to be more committed to memory in regards to content experiences compared to regular activities. )<br>- (<br><br>Informational Placement:<br> in regards to the Deployments that my Main Spriit Guides indicated and the Clarifications that my Main Spirit Guides indicated<br>in regards to Earth-Based that my Main Spriit Guides indicated and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides)<br>Hollywood<br>The Event<br>Handicap that my Main Spirit Guides indicated<br>Monetaries and funds that my Main Spriit Guides indicated<br>What my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to my Father Alan Hislop and my Mother Anna Hislop as well as those that my Main Spriit Guides indicated.
