<div class="title">(08/16/2019) &quot;Realism and Story&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: There was a moment yesterday where I Went outside and something half pulled in regards to free energy. It&#39;s one of the ones that I discern that personally on my end or culturally there has already been a thing in regards on this planet. It&#39;s  always been one of the ones that I kind of felt secure on in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated for the reasonings that they indicated but not only that but one of those ones that I just felt a certain in which spoke of the idea that it was one of those issues that I felt to be a non-issue to a certain extent and that there was many who talk and hope for free energy in a certain kind of way. Specifically physically on this physical planet Earth partially by way of free energy systems existing not only with Wind and Solar, big ones that have emerged in which some countries have adopted to the point of being to sustain themselves off of free energy. I brought up the percentages of Physical Earth Based Populations that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that are in favor of Free Energy in the contexts that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. It segwayed and I realized something. Three points in regards to the Physical Earth Based Grey Men, One) The way a large portion of the Physical Earth Based Population feel in regards to multiple Subjects, the Will of the People in which does reflect Morals. Two) You look towards Positions of Power and Fame and it is in line with many of the Peoples on this physical Planet Earth and there is more good in power than bad physically. Three) Some on this physical Planet look towards certain Grey Men and literature written about them in sometimes a negative light but maybe some of that isn&#39;t true and some of them are Good in which thought were to potentially be bad and even if some of them are not, we need to recognize and acknowledge in a certain context that there are literally moral grey men that exist in the world in which was corroborated by the Spirit Yesterday.<br>Again the focus on certain grey men at times has been bad and just because there is less literature pointing towards the Good doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist. Those three points. Regardless there was a group amidst this discussion and beforehand that were on the move and ended up potentially lended towards myself and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) being moved upwards fast. <br>- We got to a point where I felt myself reach new heights in a certain manner and I could feel other kinds of psychic stimuli. What needs to be stressed here is that there were events unfolded partially by way of interacting with in regards to content experiences. There was an Anime Cartoon I watched recently released and it hit home in a story way. A decent portion of the themes and characteristics spoke of my process and others in ways in which correlated some of the story point that have evolved in this process. I felt myself get unhooked to certain kind of Channeling in which then felt more free flowing. There was also storylines happening in which i discerned certain kinds of events happening. There was also a  big revelation in regards to certain things having to do with some of the stuff that has been happening previous to this life in that some of the resources worked on in regards to working on this life being the reason for things happening not making as much sense as it once did, not just in regards to myself though similar tidings in regards to those that my main Spirit Guides indicated. Also potentially a tactic to move past what they were trying to blame certain physicals in regards to partially because it doesn&#39;t hold salt which upon blaming past selves and past actions might be what some on my end and elsewhere are looking towards. <br>- Groups around me tonight, one letting know that we should keep driving and leave em behind but i am wondering if it has to do with something else. There was also another one about the living room area where today <br><br>Psychictivty:<br>I did a new mechanism thing in which might not be new at all but rather not utilized as often in Reacknowledgment different than what some consider reaknowledgment. There are mechanisms that we can do in regards to our wordings like emotions, realization, trust and forgiveness. Realization to recognition, they are real head area energies and mechanism. Recognization the big, realization the small. Acknowledgment the big, reacknowledment the small. Acknowledging has a feel like you similar to recognization, big cogs sort of mixing in a certain way but rather than a rolling kind of psychic stimuli it&#39;s like a movement forwards with larger energies. Understanding is a big part of realization in which goes in light with idea, light bulb moments and epiphany. Epiphany is a head area quick flourish. Recognization is like a certain kind of slower moving Cogs in which if time set a certain might actually be able to be quicker. Realization is a understanding head area mechanism in which I feel is similar to how when certain creativity happens upon creating pathways. <br>(Realization<br>Recognization<br>Acknowledge<br>Reaknowledge)<br><br>Advocationals:<br>Interaction and Psychologicals in regards to Alex James Hislop and others(defined by my Main Camp) as well as ripple effect in regards to Alex James Hislop and others(defined by my Main Camp) Actions, Non-Actions, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) <br>Those being strong armed and in circumstances in which is making them choose certain directions to be difficult.<br>Those that have been going through a lot at times and travel transported to the areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated by way of what my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>Time frame let know for those at times having to go through faster time frames<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. Light; Do what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to these advocations the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.

I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) consider Far Away Light to be the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are playing the cards that my Main Camp indicated in the moments that my Main Camp indicated especially in regards to the Amount of Times I have been stabbed in the Back Defensive Card to Defend behind our Backs, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for the Historians that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this marking, advocation, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) to write down the information that I create that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for the Historians that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this marking, advocation, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) to write down the information that I create that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.

I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for Historical Reputational Defense in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and the Historians that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Clickable links like the show all actions on the Peacekeeperalex trello account and attachments section where upon me clicking links shows up on my screen has been at times shoehorned into a spot where some in the spirit think that it needs to be shown in order for it to work. If I never traverse to Google.ca that doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist in the public especially the spiritually that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The data upon clicking some of those links on the peacekeeperalex trello account and the Alex James Hislop Documents on Github are public regardless of whether I click them or not, they have public links in which exist online especially in regards to the Spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
