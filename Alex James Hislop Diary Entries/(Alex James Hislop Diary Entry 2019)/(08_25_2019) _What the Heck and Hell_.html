<div class="title">(08/25/2019) &quot;What the Heck and Hell&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Late on the 24th I felt multiple kinds of interactions happen. A lot of things moved dimensional from my area and I am guessing there certain things moved from certain people as well. What exactly is it that we are dealing with in our homes, who knows, who doesn&#39;t and maybe understanding who wants to know and who doesn&#39;t. I would like the overlap deployments as to what exactly is happening to my family and others for what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. If the information on my Main Spirit Guides end can be facilitated to go certain directions, we need to understand that and need to be a let to respond the way we need to which again let know of interaction.<br>- When are some of these conflicts taking place that I am discerning upon interaction at times, how serious and how serious is it really suppose to reflect especially in regards to the physical human population in this physical planet earth.<br>- Clarifications in regards to other dimensional selves in regards to my Family and Friends especially in regards to some of the rumors pertaining to other physical being shaped in their likeness at Times in which has been let know to extend at times to the spiritual. What God spark lineage is pointing that some seem to be of a certain kind sometimes of certain family members and Friends in which is also seen common in certain shaping that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with me pointing towards Archetype sometimes in likeness to certain powerful spirits and Spirit groups. Example: My uncle Robert Billeter shares certain likeness to Kim Coates, Harrison Ford, Bill Murray, Kevin Klein, Richard Schiff, Bill Maher and other kinds that I have noticed noting certain traits being shaped in certain manners. How far does this extend and what does it mean in regards to physical shaping when there are other dimensional existence out there, the thing of it is is that the physical is a certain kind of in front of the scenes and potentially end of the line if their are not other dimensional a that we can interact with in this physical. This needs clarifying at times for multiple reasonings. <br>- They put a certain kind of leadership overlap on myself, a bit reminiscent to a certain content experience having to do with the presidency and some were insinuating though that it had to do with future leadership overlap in regards to myself, I am not going to lie it felt good in regards to influences but I wondered why it was. They said some are emphasizing me focusing on earth based, some it might have to do with direction and choices and I am wondering if it&#39;s in regards to some of the family meetings and updates. For certain groups it&#39;s over in a certain kind of way, some are done in a certain manner and some feel it to have been that way for a bit. I am wondering if some of my interaction changes the past couple months had anything to do with something happening in the future as well as someone viewing this process,multiple kind to be true, something changing and it does seem that these meetings and gatherings these weekend have something to do with it. I am scared. I have been scared and so have some of my family, some of them not having anything to do with it, some of the dimensional selves literal have to walk past certain things daily and totally ignore certain life and it&#39;s the cool smooth look of it from the uglier side of life that keeps me reminded of the truth of it all, maybe not as rough and red as some have said but more in line with what I have experienced. I can&#39;t imagine what it would have been to have had the support that some now put on me at times supposedly, because this can seem like the twilight zone at times, especially when getting attacked is a tuck under the rug might not remember for some tomorrow, which might have been a better look five years ago and a totally different direction but I suppose some needed to get over it? God if was as easy for that for others and on one hand the misunderstanding of hated direction pertaining to a physical creating earth disclaimers in the physical digital that was utilized in such a way to shoehorn the uglier side of it all when some got to protect me from something they half agree, utilization of resources dictates at times. <br>- The smooth Feng shui of it all in this process is destroying that direction, there is a spotlight of truth upon this process that exists and extends beyond to this of earth in certain manners. It&#39;s a quick sand that is understood and revealing the hidden warfare&#39;s of the world and Everytime I feel a smooth attack Feng shuied as my mistake, knee jerk reaction, covered up as a scare tactic and an acting method, it is understood. It&#39;s not just understood in the higher up areas it&#39;s understood in certain dimensional common rooms and even in the places down below. Thee are those that know the truth now from this process. It&#39;s not of solely those of us the smooth demeanor and long game mend, those trying to cover up what has aggrieved their lives, it&#39;s also those trying to mask that to be the case, the ones that don&#39;t just try to infiltrate our own cultures but also those of other kinds as well, when it moves past physical earth based Nations and even looks upon spiritual Nations. <br>- Where does the recourse lie with so much battle happening at times? One thing I want to stress is that for some battle is taking place and I do feel their is accords in play to stave certain kinds of battle taking place this weekend, but how much needs to happen. How much battle is going to be dragged upon. How much will not happen but rather happen in a different way. I feel there will be battle and is battle upon us and the smothering and denying that such things exist might be choking something else. But their is a chit for diplomacy to certain degree that only goes so far. Of course for myself and others it&#39;s also a certain kind,I&#39;ll see a huge war with Giants and monsters get moved so far away from me that they look like microbes compared to some of the higher up stuff, those deadly movers sounding the insect horn and you can even some of the boys checking their huds for them, for some their are smalls on the move that regardless of how powerful and far removed you always keep a watchful covered eye on. The kind I speak of is actually to me felt to be in front of the scenes, karmic realm spirits for some might be able to view some of them and the interaction is everything.   When a big forms up and entire battlefields change to emerge a smoking figure in a suit, where a process with billions and trillions gets to look like a handful of people, obviously with shoehorn of the other trillions of to the side lol it&#39;s the change that can happen so quick that some are noting and in the mix where is the truth. Who is bad and good especially when those lines should have been so clearly defined with all of the grey area emphasized to lament upon such a line as important as that? How the heck and hell did it ever get to the point where it was the rest below the thresholds to have to figure it out without those lines fully defined, shouldn&#39;t it be those below that understand where they stand with all of the difficulties at times involved?<br>- There was a storyline. I had created multiple disclaimers within the past hour. Some tried to use it as enxcuse but it didn&#39;t fully make sense why a certain apocalyptic reaction like that would happen in a certain context. The information itself only pertains to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There was this reaction partially by some moving to the future and upwards, some moving on. I did advocations and clarifications as well as a run down of what I did and realized that again this is to do with something else. There was story in the mix of all of this turbulence. One where it was said that I was put here by the bad guy. That the bad guy was suppose to take this life but he didnt. I thought it interesting if I was stilloyal, someone commented on it and I discerned my loyalty to be intact even smooth, even though I had doubt in my head area. The idea that the good guy out me in here, especially if I wasn&#39;t the bad guy and was still loyal made it stark. There was something bad about that good guy play if I was innocent and yet I sensed that if it was and told to a certain extent that what would that mean for the positioning of the good guy and how far back it went and where did it lead especially in regards to my own self and for those trying to get everyone. Why me? Why them? What exactly did we do deserve this? The answer is strange but not necessarily misunderstood. Tales of sherifs going incarnate to shouefeur certain baddies. To be true I did not discern myself to be truly evil but a low level mobster. I am wondering whether that bad guy knew about some of these tells and stops pertaining to some of the accords but I truly went the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Almost like some would have rather had me go the way than Fredo on the boat what painful irony and terrible path to have literally my viewpoint feel that it would be worse by way of hairpin consciousness safety which wasn&#39;t enough for me be the same viewpoint that flip on a dime after so much time. I still tried to help though. Interesting how it was certain baddies who limited such relief and defense as well as suppression of truth that would help the unruly mob but to rather do it themselves that way to gain the credit and then blame me for my slacking of saving the bad guy and it laments upon the clash of authorities and different kinds in which always had me knocking on the banners door for blame. Wouldn&#39;t that fit perfect to be a side character in this nerve racking story but be it for that I wouldn&#39;t want you to be the side character for dislike and disrespect but nowhere nears you being the main villain for fear of the coward I am at times and scaredy cat ways as well as not ruining the future. Potentially part and present to be true but a clash of bad guys like myself, the shadow and the Life Utilization Family to clash with such authority. Intriguing. I don&#39;t mean to be upsetting but I had to make an appeal.<br>- All throughout the day spent most of it with Jeff, Jamie and Robbie, it was really amazing to see these people together again in the physical. A decent bout of verbal advocations in regards to Robert, Luisa and Hook to a certain degree.Ed, Penny and Buddha as well as Jamie made the trip up from Michigan.<br>- Bonfire with family, interesting primal and sacred systems around to a certain degree. Ones where I can go to a process in my mind and discern a response in regards to my process, there is respect in regards to this system. Throughout the day there has been emphasis from certain spirit around myself in focus upon skipping past whether some of us got attacked or not partially because of some of use were in which there potentially those trying to utilize this kind of thing to have it have happen upon gauging what people believe in and opinions regarding. There has been metaphoricals regarding, like listening to a content experience in regards to <br>- Jealousy systems presented themselves yesterday to a certain extent in which welcomes an interesting twist in the spider storyline. I continue to experience spider flashes and stimuli, lamenting upon a storyline of the Female Spider for some one of the storylines talks of sleeping with the enemy. The idea that I was the spider was floated and the idea that I shouldn&#39;t sleep with the enemy as well in certain places but in the correct context it&#39;s not unheard of in correct contexts in fact in upper light it&#39;s still smiled upon in certain regard. <br>- Desentization in regards to certain things like channel niceties and upper class kind of stuff but it can seem scary too, like not feeling scared in regards to certain monsters. Real smooth stuff like psychologically influencing my perspective to potentially getting me out of areas so said to save but also from other perspectives leaving some behind potentially or not approaching the situations as you want to approach. Smooth areas, I identify with Ri culture in a certain manner but am not fully in which made it seemingly decent to stick me with certain kind of supposedly trene culture at times in which though I feel is not necessarily set in stone. <br>- Those that don&#39;t have a problematic with saving ugly and darker side but rather are limited seemingly by energy constraints. While others don&#39;t save in regards to certain kind because of other reasonings and have certain energy.  <br>- They have said to have feng shuied a certain kind in regards to my life in regards to life utilization partially in a capacity that can help but also not necessarily sanctioned from my Main Spirit Guides in the Light.<br><br>Advocationals:<br>Outfitting<br>Gadget Experts<br>Cadets Protection<br>Time Alignments <br>End Games<br>Objectives<br>Viability<br>Alternatives<br>SAFETY<br>Storage<br>Holdings<br>Qualities, Traits and Mechanisms.<br>Those that Promote Immorality.<br>Stance for True.<br>Segway Teams<br>Connection Mappings and Trees<br>Shapers<br>Those targeted through my actions and non-actions.<br>Those that were locked away for being crazy and for some not adhering to the direction of certain courses.

The idea to operate with integrity being one of them and where the viewer and spiritual can hear that call and change life years from now upon watching that scene.<br>Being placed in those areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated still impacts regardless and still lends to defense and the things that kick in that my Main Spirit Guides Indicated upon being placed in the areas that my Main Spirit Guides Indicated, these two points can help in defending and seeing reason in regards to why you can place me in certain areas. <br>Angels<br><br>#Outfitting #Preparation #Retrofitting #UnderstandingConflicts #UnderstandingConflict #ConflictOrganization #WhoBelongsInWhichConflictEmphasis #Truth #Shaping #ThereIsAPercentageOfPhysicalEarthBased-HumansThatGoWithMyMainSpiritGuidesIndicated #Angels #Battle<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
