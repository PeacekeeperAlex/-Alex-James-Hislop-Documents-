<div class="title">(10/12/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Mood: Wistful, Sad and outlandish.<br>Poetry: To hope is to keep.<br>Horoscope: New beginnings are heralded today, particularly where travel, education, and legal matters are concerned. Difficult decisions may need to be made. Don&#39;t agonize over them. Whatever you decide should work out beautifully. Think carefully about your plans. Take care of any paperwork that you&#39;ve put off before moving on to more interesting matters.<br>Quote: “Sadness is but a wall between two gardens.”<br>– Kahlil Gibran<br><br>Activity:<br>There was a moment where upon certain kind trying to involve me in some of the battle and conflict happening to a certain extent, I responded in a certain fashion. Some have been trying to subtle utilize a Life utilization conflict on my end in which I see spirit using my life and information in manners not agree upon by my Main Spirit Guides in the Original Light with another kind having to do with certain kind of spiritual conflict pertaining to Earth and others that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. It&#39;s been for the past couple days and even before so in which I have seen a spike of Life Utilization issues on my end and it being brought via conversation as well as let know that life utilization in other places situated. Again another tell that has emerged is that another past life was encroached upon in a certain way. Some of Which dont have anything to do with me but other kinds did. What is being said to a certain extent is that in the past and past and future interaction in regards to this process has changed in which some have noted that I have a strong defensives case and a certain direction needed but for me the physical time in the past has already happened. Which tells of certain utilization that took place in which was not clouth and not fully kosher at times if not more than that. This speaks on multiple levels but I feel I did have a cover in a certain sense but also not so.<br>- Upon some of the arguing and banter as well as conversation and defense works emerged a certain stimuli in which felt to be related to degeneration disease in physical brain. Physical stimuli in which has been noted to be manipulable by spirit and other dimensionals maneuvered onto my head area, this stimuli felt like physical particles and I noted that my mental systems were being attacked potentially related to the head area. I noted certain spiritual smalls harmed and attacked on head as well. This might also be to try and create such a mechanic existing in regards to physical placement of stimuli or it might be naturally related or a normality. Either way I relayed defensive impressions and did advocations but a healing energy was placed on my head area as well. This physical stimuli at first felt hot and heated almost like a vein heated stimuli i have associated with degeneration but it also changed. It felt to settle in and not be irritated anymore. One thing noted is that earlier mixed signals in regards to my body were sent, spiritual stimuli told me that a sectioning off of my torso, head, legs and potentially arms in which certain spiritual stimuli looked to trying to section off parts of my body in which was potentially trying to send mixed signals. The stimuli was thought of to be controlled from a certain advanced spirit or dimensional being. Again this was happening during certain kind trying to draw me into certain conflict. I still feel my mentality suppressed and it feels like a strong spirit or god is pressing my head area. <br>- Other dimensional teeth stimuli today as well in which I felt there to be chicklet shoved into my teeth in which my teeth supposedly did not agree with. <br>- Another dimensional infrastructure earlier on I had noted to be related potentially to be irritation and muted sense similar to oxygen deprivation but more sensitive related. This infrastructure seemingly related in a certain way.<br>- Early morning change in regards to talking about mundane thing where energies got heightened and driving sort of infrastructure stuff happened <br><br>A switch happened. I felt like a certain kind of topic get brought up and then I felt like as an orb was taken from me in which had a fluidity too it and also said to have an innocence too it as well. I didn&#39;t notice this spiritual orb before. It reminded me a bit of channeling this orb, like an essence of channeling almost but different, light beige golden colour to the orb itself. There is an are in regards to my infrastructure in which there is a battle taking place. Beforehand there was spirit around me in which reminded me of Fall.l The impressions of cool and fall, seasons changing were around and I did a let know in regards to Nature pertaining to what Earth-Based Nature Acknowledges and thanks pertaining to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light. There was said to have been a spirit that had gone away in regards to my life but also potentially in regards to others. Another tell emerged is that some spirit in regards to Higher God spark that some would at like other dimensional selves of this God spark tried to claim that somehow I and others that my Main Spriit Guides indicated are other dimensional selves of this spirit by way of that Higher God Spark. There was a spirit of Nature around me in which I felt a segway happen where there was another spirit around me in which was affected by way of me playing violent videos games. <br><br> and a claim in regards to other dimensionals selves pertaining me and others in which pointed towards certain events taking place.<br>Interaction Changing, Spiritual Energies invoked, I felt a smooth energy that tried to get me to talk about Jamie, Life Utilization Discussions, another system came around me too where I felt like I was playing an interaction and video games but then it didn&#39;t pan out or something, spirit that have been trying to get to the areas that my Main Spriit Guides indicated to be able to promote immorality without harming as well as the immorality alternatives for some in which is still certain kinds of immorality but the certain kind allowed in certain sections of systems given certain circumstances.  I realized that certain spirit are working against me with a smooth feng shui but rather working against certain kinds in regards to life utilization. Certain spirit in regards to Earth affected, Certain higher up around energies around, moved into certain areas, less argumentative more conversation. A certain really dig this past couple days of chill out direction and also a interesting noting that what I have been doing at times within the past couple weeks has been similar. A low soft voice that seems reserved and damaged. A Spirit Emergence taking place in certain areas.<br><br>Certain spirits facilitating a certain interaction around me in which I feel is partially for show in a certain context. <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for what my Main Spirit Guides indicated for us to advocate in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to utilization of systems that my Main Spriit Guides indicated in regards to Alex James Hislop and Others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br><br>Informational Placement:<br>War Board: Diplomacy and Mediation (War Board - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account) <br>Those that have been left behind<br>in regards to ArchonZephael and those that my Main Spriit Guides indicated (AJH Daily Defensives Board - x29 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br><br>Themes: #Incarnation #<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
