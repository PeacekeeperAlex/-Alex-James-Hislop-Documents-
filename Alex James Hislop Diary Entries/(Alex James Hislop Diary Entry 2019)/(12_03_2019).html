<div class="title">(12/03/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Does there need to be a day where you shake the rust upon writing and creating content. It seems that I have seen some of the inner workings to systems lent to the creation and endeavors of what we do on this physical planet. One such endeavour for myself is writing daily questions to the spirit in which I have hopes to turn into a book one day. Yesterday as I recounted on my Audio Entry, I went to write my Daily Questions to the Spirit Portion and was blocked by Writers Block in which as I spoke earlier seems to be related to spiritual suppression and to Spiritual help. Within the bubble I discerned a spirit at work creating writing but on the thresholds of that bubble it felt that the edge was the writers block that most writers discern. It made me curious upon this Diary entry as to whether there are creatives out there in which are being utilized to block other kinds of spirits especially bigger ones in which might discern ourselves to be certain kinds of smalls. It&#39;s intriguing and scary to know that those kinds of mechanics are spiritually influenced and the fact that the writers block we can experience at times might be certain spirit in vicinity who are creatively inclined. Too be true I think there might be a small portion in which this is the case and not the larger portion. Wouldn&#39;t that be tragic if we did affect other kinds of spiritually entities in which there is a large portion of reliance on the spiritual regarding. I think unlocking ourselves creatively would be want most of the physical humans on this earth-based would want especially rather than blocking ourselves and other-dimensionals in creative endeavors. Spiritually speaking though how exactly is it that we can be more creative in our own lives at times when it is difficult let alone to maneuver past our own boundaries seemingly to be able to pursue different activities in which can help such unblocking. I think also another thing that needs to be considered is that kind of creation that people do within their everyday lives upon some of those artistic pursuit that others have done. Like the the fact that there is certain spiritual around oneself in which might not be around others that can interact with some of the things that we do. Putting on a movie or video game and the light creation that happens being seen and interacted with in certain dimensional setting might be considered an artistic and creativity upon just switching on some of those things. It can spur thought, reason and philosophy as well as fun and happiness. The drive to do different things should also not be reliant in regards to losing family of allpersonal. An infrastructure moves away from a person who then changes and has different behavior. What of the life though of such things. What is the correlation in being able to heal certain spirit and physicals without having to lose access to allpersonal and why is movement sometimes the answer. I wonder how many physical humans looked upon some of their allpersonal family that was taken away in certain moment, from younger ages to not even get a chance to fully be able to understand or appreciate said family to the kind that had been shifted around so much that a desensitization took over to the moments of sadness, grief and loss of some of the spiritual that would just be taken away in moments so said to be natural at times that were just suppose to accept such things. What exactly was it in your lives Earth-Based human Physicals? <br>There are these moments. Where I would see these pick and roll bringing up of topics in which would see landscape changes to the process and other kinds. Two big ones that have been brought up as of late are disconcerting but also maybe a good thing. I am hoping it&#39;s a good thing.  One had to do with the idea that somehow the reasoning that i and others have utilized being the spiritual events took place behind the scenes for some of the things that happened rather than a primary being placed upon our own actions and the idea that there were some in which were utilizing power from that reasoning being used. This I feel is partially a decent thing because there are many good spirit that have been utilizing such power responsibly. Still I wondered if there some that were not in which also made me wonder about event utilization. It kind of felt like a nerve was stuck by way of bringing up this topic and interestingly enough the thought of whether it was me that wrote it down or brought it up as well as the spirit invoking such a thought and that actions on their end that made multiple spirit both feel a sadness in regards to those in which were being mislabeled but also a curiosity in regards to uncovering of such a storyline that seemed quite a far a ways. Was there somehow a reasoning that it was brought up and why is there sometimes certain kind of themes invoked in key moments. The reason might be important but what was also strange was the lens flip in how I sensed this storyline partially unravel. It was almost like some were working on this storyline behind the scenes in a certain sense and that given some of the events within the past couple days, moments where it seemed like I was interacting in ways which talked about a certain kind of present. I have noticed that sometimes I will talk about things that already had happened spiritually years ago and the sometimes there are times when I talk about things in which are right on the money which shoehorns me in an area of the present moment, a certain kind. This one about event utilization, specifically from the lens that maybe there is something there when some say that spiritual events are taking place. Though I do feel that the is a smoke and mirrors potentially in the mix because I do feel like one of the key reasons this might have been brought up was looking at other spiritualist of similar ilk to myself on this planet earth and the idea that there actions are not solely responsible for certain events taking place. Remember that these are spiritual conversations that I am having at times with the spirit in multiple kinds of ways but also energies that I sometimes feel which can be a form of communication. The second big one that was brought up was partially about miracles. There has been a themes of God and miracles at times within this process past couple days. I had wondered early this morning had there been certain magic, miracles and science that had taken place upon certain kind passing on. I had compared it to myself in a certain manner which was spurred about the though of taking back my allpersonal with me given consent and quality of life as well as the context for some of it deployment in which is needed to be able to achieve that.It&#39;s more than that though it also involves god spark recovery in manners in which may seem miraculous in certain places but in other potentially not so. This doesn&#39;t just involved me but other kinds as well. I felt movement but also reassurance in the spirit that they take such matters seriously and I felt that there is a lot of good that has safeguarded certain moments in the past from utilization of such power and miraculous that could be invoked upon certain kind passing on. The instructions of such things matter greatly. Imagine a person lives a life and impacts in such a way where there were literal miracles that took place in a certain manner partially by way of the power that had been when that person passes on. <br>There seems to be a spirit trying to tell that there is a certain kind of animosity and forming up currently underway when I had wondered if it was event streamlining and avoiding another kind of conflict and potential result that took place. Still, maybe it&#39;s two-fold and multiple-fold.
