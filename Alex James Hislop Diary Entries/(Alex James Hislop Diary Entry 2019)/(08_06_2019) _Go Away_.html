<div class="title">(08/06/2019) &quot;Go Away&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- It&#39;s continued to be lamented upon in certain manners this idea of traps and strong arming in regards to my direction and others. I ask, do we not choose what route we would want to go based upon those places that my Main Spirit Guides indicated where we wouldn&#39;t be manipulated and influenced in such ways as to be strong armed and coerced in such directions where it no longer feels to be us but rather someone else pushing us in a certain direction. I thought of it from the perspective of how I truly want to proceed especially upon those places where I can analyze and feel the way I want to feel. There is direction we can take in places below in which doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be considered a certain kind of direction variable to be factored into the direction of how we feel in those places where we feel the way we intended to feel.<br>- For myself it&#39;s been a struggle in regards to certain things and some claim to be doing e a service in which some are, that sort of thing that says that true happiness to be found by moving on in a certain sense might be correct but there is also those in the mix who just want me out of the way and I am not going away. Even if it is just a small or simpleton sort of style it still holds a certain kind of impact that can be utilized in the manners that my Main Spirit Guides intended. There are no doubt different kinds of ways of setting up the process and I think there has been talk about it.<br>- One of the things has to do with how to proceed with this process and the ongoing maneuvering and fighting in regards to process direction and how to utilize this process on resources grounds alone someone might take a look at certain things and proceed in a certain direction but you take a look at how some want me to be a part of a group setting and how other want me to proceed in a lonne sort of process capacity. I want the best of both worlds, still a part of a group while maintaining a certain kinds of style of process in which can lend towards certain tactic anyhow. One of the key points in regards to this process and myself thought is that it isn&#39;t just about me in which loses respect and credibility in regards to the utilization of my process and myself over the past 2 years. Speak to me in a couple years and it might be changed. Regardless there are still other and in which if we look at the statistics regarding and what does it tell us. Ligh,  display the stats in regards to this process in the degrees that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>- One of the main bringing up of points in which hit home in multiple capacities was that of hey, what the heck do you need my informational placement when you already have fancy spiritual sort of stuff that you hit me over the head for being a simpleton anyhow, even some of the simple stuff can look daunting in regards to my own sro fo thing in which segwayed in a certain manner in regards to physical earth based stuff upon understanding and looking at some of the spiritual that exists and content creation anyhow in which laments upon something else to be true that might not have anything to do with needing us, you need us? really? Some of you don&#39;t and is being utilized as an excuse to control us but the crazy part of some of this is the amount of resources poured into controlling some of this planet to a certain extent and then when some point towards it and say, wait we screwed up too much on resources tish as to matter that worked against some of us. <br>- Anyhow, some of my direction felt this past couple days like to give up on certain things partially by way of attack and manipulation as well as realization and being afraid. Attacked to go certain directions and recognize this process to be more than me. Partially correct but by the time the good spirits feng shui it a certain way it then gets grabbed by certain negatives and spun a certain kind of way. Especially with some of the resources going towards process alternatives it just looks a certain kind in which jives with my dubiousness of the utilization of my process and impact as well as others. <br>- I took a walk into town and also drove into to get some e cigarette parts. <br><br>Advocationals:<br>Peoples leaving higher up to protect down below advocations especially in regards to logistics personnel, viability and ways in which it doesn&#39;t have to stretch resources thin. <br>Speed, how to get quicker down here?<br>Ability, Circumstance and energy in regards to Working on certain job, given the correct circumstances can change lives and heal those that dislike certain kinds of jobs.<br><br>Being split up in multiple kinds of ways like God sparks and such then while split up a God Spark Attacked. Think of this, the First time God Split up, How would Go react in regards to that God Spark being attacked.<br><br>My Happiness shouldn&#39;t be tethered to my Anti-Camp&#39;s Happiness, my emotions and behaviour affected in regards to some of that to a certain extent upon looking and feeling happy when something bad is potentially happening. Compromise could be that when they are happy in a good way that that is reflected on my emotions. I and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated choose what my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit GUides indicated. <br><br>Circus. <br><br>Moving dimensional Overlaps away from earth and myself the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>Trap information to be displayed where my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to Industry and Industry Types that my Main Spirit GUides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>Segway History<br><br>Child Safeties<br><br>I am Alex James Hislop.
