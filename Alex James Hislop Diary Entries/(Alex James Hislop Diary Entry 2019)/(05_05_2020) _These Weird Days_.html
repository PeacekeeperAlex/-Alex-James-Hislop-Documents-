<div class="title">(05/05/2020) &quot;These Weird Days&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: Take five on a new write down if please for when informational placement is understood to be situated maybe it will better off for many of processes and what I consider interesting is the way the spiritual our interacting with me these days, I have been silent at times and I haven&#39;t done what some wanted me to but it&#39;s nowhere nears to the degree that some think. And some have been saying and really the blinders as to what is really happening should be understood. Imagine going through WWII in the spiritual behind the scenes without us fully knowing? At what point spiritual for the amount of other selves in regards to oneself does one take notice spiritually in regards to what has been happening. Consent exists for a reason and I don&#39;t blame anyone for not wanting to have to protect and even not so by way of not having that style of life exists. I have to apologize for I haven&#39;t been fully facilitating at times for what some have wanted me too and at what direction is that the case for any given faction. I never meant to offend by way of spiritually defending myself and the line of the process is still there. Haze of smoke and food, lethargy and groggy upon so it has been tried but also a vivid awareness taking place. At what point do I not look at my mistakes and understand my weaknesses. But I can still change on the drop of a dime and have access to what I need to be able to protect myself in the sense that has and to be truth honest it has been Good, Superb and Honest and at what point are we not seeing such propagandist truth to be true I am scared in other dimensional. I always will be for a reason. I wish I could take back the things that truly did happen but I feel it can be still even if certain spiritual still will not recognize the truth that I have been saying about ability, power and authority to be true. Why wouldn&#39;t it scare me though no wild west if even higher beings of civilized nature were to traverse and change the stars, I am pro deployment and Pro Retrieval, I like both and is a normal stance I feel to be true but there were ones where physical humans in spiritual for what they are common is sometimes seen to of to the side scared. Why do you think that is? Because some of the culture spiritual that has been emerged and has always existed for a portion, the stuff that has been legendary old and many other kinds of old ways forgotten once you see and remember that will have you comparison in how you want to experience life. It&#39;s a sacred thing and a personal thing at times. I know what mine are in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides relayed but what was your? and how do you like to experience moments. There was this feeling of doubt, anger, give up attitude early in the morning which kind of felt to be the angrier side of myself that does want this life finished but I do disagree for I feel I should get another 50 years or so to be able to let know about some of the spiritual and other-dimensional that are taking place. The kinds of stuff happening as of late has been to finish the last of the weed for this three day stint. But now it&#39;s Monday and the interaction has reflected spiritual off to the side doing their own thing. It scares me because at what point is the turbulence and conflict making things to the point of no return. At what point for me will always be and until this gets figured especially that point as to the reason why we can&#39;t just quick feng shui this kind of jargon in which would fit full description of the kinds of nightmare and hell brimstone terribleness but it doesn&#39;t have to be because you can employ multiple kinds of defense, Memories and orb interaction in psychictivity physical have told that that stuff exists and the spiritual conversations that follow suit with full clear out loud channeling. Mind channeling as well I can consult and it&#39;s not the extent of lightworking abilities as well as spiritual abilities that physical humans can do spiritually. If belief is real and I can fee lit as a psychic medium that can identify with the colour and old teachings manifesting in skill and attributes as has been seen in the process again both in communication and interaction discernment as a Psychic-Medium. Yellow Gold reminds me of belief and I would be able to discern the head mechanics for some of the spiritual belief and energy placements that one can do in which is a normal way of operating in regards to the spiritual. One of the rules that might be true is that in which speaks of near every mechanics of what you thought there to be in regards to yourself, Spiritual bodies, atmospherics, heavens and afterlife, memories, Perception, Awareness, Energy Discernment, and think about like Trust, Forgiveness and belief, we utilize in daily speech every day and there is spiritual mechanics behind the anatomy of yourself that allows that to exist. Creation mechanisms in head area, need only utilize impressional and other kinds to access it. Forgiveness overlaps in chest area that you can do to a written callword you up with write down on pencil. Create informational placement blocking that can be as good anchors of spiritual information which would do less harm compared to the informational placement of what some at times have been within other dimensional information. Write about concepts spiritual that exist like Anima and Animus, spirit of Animal Nature and by extension Nature. You can go to religions to know there are different support systems and descriptor of the heavens spoken about in the time spoken about but also later on in the recreation of existences on this planet especially that in which is descriptive within Earth-Based and Space Religions that in regards to not only physical but spiritual as well too. Some down here are looked upon like gods. Maybe even half god and when angels and demons walk the street with the multiple devils to exist and the Lights and Light beings as well as Good Beings that exist throughout this planet and you throw authorities in the mix with all the emblems and badges and the other things that my Main Spirit Guides, it gets for a wild ride at times but there is Good arriving from up above in regards to Earth-Based and others that my Main Spirit Guides relayed. Maybe it&#39;s a sign of the mend in how things are working. If these machinsms of life that we have even as far as to urges and the energies felt during intimacy are pointing interaction with the spiritual in many different ways. Pleasure body mechanics spiritual that exist, why doesn&#39;t it not make sense for that to be partially spiritual. Of course the energies, whether it be though of how someone is sexy or the emotions that are felt during physical and spiritual intimacy. If we surmise on what we have seen in regards to Movies and Series, Books and Music, things where when I consume such content that I am partially able to see the spiritual not only by way of me being able to change my own anatomy by way of impressions think back to holidays and the colored impressions that we feel in head area regarding, when you think of numbers and Calendar months, when you think of different celebrations. Memory but also perception and the it can feel like intermingled spiritual sense of touch and sight, like seeing through in which I have seen psychic visions and interplay regarding that have proven interaction one of which happened a jazz bar in perception. Smoke in the bar, cartoon like features and music and instruments sensed through the door. This phenomenon should not miscounted and mislabeled especially given the communications of open channeling and automatic writing as well as the other light working ability tells whether it be forgiveness, trust, creation, manifestation, movement and some of which relied upon by the senses in which we can develop down here by utilizing many different techniques, chakra work and form work with spiritual bodies existence and correlated by many finding by the spiritual communities on Earth-Based. Enlightentment and love shown and experienced to be one of the greatest pursuits one can do. It keeps getting repeated over and over again that might be one of the key expresses as to who we truly our. Compassion and Care being ultra important as well. Reason and intellect are keys to a better future. Making effort everyday helps, it changes the stars. Reasons to live for people who feel they don&#39;t want to live, that you might have a spiritual relationship interactions and all especially throughout life and intimacy experiences that exist, watch a video and have a relationship spiritual especially given if we can experience hundreds of years and thousands of years behind the scenes in regards to other selves. The interaction can seem like it is grabbing your attention because it is partially spiritual details of attention with love and compassion, passion and can be primal but it can also be the opposite of that in both and many experiencing what they want to experience with the kinds of things that exist at what point is there not to love life. Healed. Saved. Imagine the pleasure you feel in life when you do experience intimacy to be spiritually motivated with someone that you love. You can talk to them. They hear you. They are around and your interaction is understood and there is a response spiritually in pursuing spiritual endeavors and at what point does not a good portion of life get considered to be spiritual.  The past 5 days have been a strange archetype within this process seen at times years ago when I would foil over whether I should smoke more in the search of weed crumbs on my dresser.<br><br></div>
