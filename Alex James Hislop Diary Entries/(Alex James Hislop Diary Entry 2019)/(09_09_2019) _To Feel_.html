<div class="title">(09/09/2019) &quot;To Feel&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- Today as I have been reading the Novel It I have been aware that dimensionally and spiritually they have placed me in certain areas regardless of doing advocations and things of that nature. One of the things on spirits mind has to do with what some are experiencing and the ripple effect regarding. Also misconception to a certain extent has been talked about as well especially in regards to depiction of certain kind through form utilization and other kinds. Portrayed some of the stimuli as high impact in which partially might be so upon being up above in a certain context but there was also let know that I was also brought dimensionally downwards while still being located upwards. Some of the interaction in regards to why it seems that I haven&#39;t been met with certain turbulence during this week has potentially had to do with certain experiences that some have already done to myself as well as others dimensional selves but also allpersonal and doppelgangers specifically in regards to the It Chapter 2. There has been let knows here and there and I am wondering if a bit talking point as well and I think there was discussion yesterday having to do with  venting, reaction and release in regards to expecting there to be certain spiritual violence and conflict that certain spirits that promote immorality and our used to that culture were expecting. I feel that there has been multiple kinds of ways to be able to confront that safety in being able to provide entertainment fro some in which si satisfying that should work as a to counteract emotional blocks and energy blocks pertaining to sensing and experiencing the stimuli some thought to expect but also in the midst of it all is the kinds of stuff taking place in certain areas where there is immorality promotion. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there has been certain kinds of scares and immorality promotion and also the kinds of stuff that says I am being scarred mentally and visually but the interaction changed these past couple days and the real truth is that it stems from going to that movie on the 6th of September, 2019 for some of it. The interaction has been changing but the events of whatever the hell happened that changed something. During me reading It the Novel multiple kinds of things were brought up like past energies reminiscent of some of the stuff I experienced when I was younger. Different kinds of impressions and memories in which has been letting me know multiple kinds of communications but also the idea that some it back then wasn&#39;t necessarily what some of it feel it might be today and if it is the kinds of damage and change that that would cause especially upon some talking like it&#39;s my other-dimensional selves to be blamed beforehand. There is a long game sort of encroaching I feel upon some of the interaction this day having to do with reveals and let knows to a certain extent and what exactly are those elt knows staving and what are the hopes in regards to conversing about some of this stuff. Some of it might be to sow certain kind a part like trying to pit certain kind again one another when we are on the same side. Some of the stuff revealed was the kind of things I would look towards certain earth based authorities and chirp them out to a certain degree but I think some of that stuff has already been recognized at least in a certain capacity. <br>- Near the end of the day there has been heightened spotlight and clarity lense on myself. I am not certain what the correlation is about bringing up some of the stuff I talk about this week, instead of talking about it chapter 2 and Pennywise. I have sort of been reading the book and delving into the literature this week, going to the release as well as seeing it one more time later in the week. Iv still doing verbal advocations and Callword work in which I want to be doing daily but I don&#39;t know why some are trying to bring up the long game mend at times and having me speak about it, not that there is anything wrong with that but some sort of went with that for certain reasonings and forming up. Since really the 6th there hasn&#39;t been too much talk about it chapter 2 and it&#39;s only gotten further removed, which might be to protect myself but I am not certain. I feel there is motivation that isn&#39;t moral and some of it might have to do with not wanting me in the mix not for safety but other nefarious reasonings but maybe it is decent. 1) Am I getting attacked this week regardless of whether it be and other dimensional self? 2) If so is that the reasoning why I am at times being kept away from the subject? Or is to protect me and are the confusing of those lines something that is a problem? 3) What does Earth-Based and Outside of this world have to do with Pennywsie and does it anything to do with one of the storylines discerned 4) What does the previous have to do with some of the subject lines that I talk about daily especially the conflict taking place. <br>- It&#39;s interesting to note that on the 6th we had those contrasting lines of Cinema event releases as well as the conflicts taking place. It didn&#39;t take much of my end physically, a free words and conversation in which has to do with receiving defense in turbulent situations and not so but also spiritually what the hell was happening when that emotional feeling of giving up and being afraid reminiscent of I have responded to life at times like if my parents were to pass how would I proceed and handle myself, like if I got lost in the city and I had no one to call, being lost is a key feature. Being lost, afraid and not knowing what to do next. Hot tears. These feelings popped up when I had missed my bust to the silver city cinema in Newmarket in which I knew some spiritually were replying upon me to attend that movie in the allotted times, some of it superficial but some of it most certainly not. Some thought I wasn&#39;t going to make that showing bit I certainly did, I walked not far actually after realizing that my life and phone plan were sending mixed signals as to how I wanted to proceed and How I felt like proceeding. God after arguing with you about not really being there and the fact that that you can send me more than just the naming of street sign to lament upon a current situation in my life and others, you can see the life path changed and interaction in this process had I not had that argument and brought up those things to a certain degree. What does it say? How do you feel about talking about the idea of heaven being able to save in an instant if they chose too as well as the long game mend of healing upon some of things that have happened to some of our God Spark?<br>/@#$_&amp;-++)/~`|•√ππ÷¶∆£¢€¥^°=={}\*%©®™✓[]*&quot;&#39;:;!?<br>- What was the correlation of the dream I had in regards to the symbolism of Cinema Mafia. Was there a passing of the torch and if there was, how do people feel about it? Or was it a let know in regards to other things more seemingly thought to be? The dream I had this day in the morning was a dream about certain characters which I took from as a warning and a let know about hollywood and cinema. I am not certain what some of the characters were talking about but I took it as certain kind were in town and might have always been in town but I am not certain. There was a connection regarding some that traversed past consent boundaries to save spirits. but past a certain normality and comfort zone even with certain kinds of greed coverage plans.<br><br>Psychictivty:<br>Mind and mental ignoring like hearing someone speak and walking away while blocking them in a certain manner mentality, spiritual energies.regarding that and ways in which we can utilize that in regards to callwords <br>Bubbles of silence and serene enveloped by waves of turbulent energies in the chest are upon pursing intimacy.
