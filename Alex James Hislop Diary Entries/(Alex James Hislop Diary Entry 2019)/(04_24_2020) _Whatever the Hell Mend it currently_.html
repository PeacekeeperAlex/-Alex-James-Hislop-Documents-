<div class="title">(04/24/2020) &quot;Whatever the Hell Mend it currently be&quot;</div>
<div class="content"><br>Activity:<br>(Continued from the previous day)<br><br>The topic of discussion was continued on from the look of things that exist within some of the true good facilitates that my Main Spriit Guides relayed.<br>There is another way in which does not have to be real spiritual channeling through and inhabiting the body in which the experience and stimuli can not only be just as good but some say better. The restriction of things that can be done upon agreeance becomes different by not having to worry about certain kind of spiritual getting harmed in a literal manner by way of gaming mechanics and other kinds of existence mechanics in which facility facilitation can facilitate. The feeling compared to the real thing has been seen to be just as good in many circumstances. Hundreds of dimensional setups that can be the real kind of dimensional in many different ways of experiencing what one wants to experience from the Dark Point of View.. Not to mention your realms of existence that exist in the higher places and in the Good areas that my Main Spirit Guides relayed. Some never thought they had a workshop just as good if not better waiting for them there to be able to experience what they wanted to experience. Some don&#39;t but it still is a possibility depending on who you are and want to be. Let&#39;s say you wanted to play a battle, they say simulation at times but a simulation can feel and look and sense to be real and it can be labelled and feng shuied as such in certain manners upon a point of realism and truth need be revealed. It doesn&#39;t have to change certain things because for some there can still be a utilization of ascetics from real spiritual upon the not harm portions and even embellishment upon some of the actions that takes place upon certain battles. Not to mention being able to play against live players that don&#39;t receive the harm depicted on your side of the screen but still getting reaction. And you don&#39;t think there is a large communities of groupings existences for that like to watch such things if you are the type? And if your not the type and want to only play against pure computer for the stimuli experienced that exists as well. The battle commences and you control what you want too, you see the battle not going your favor in the perimeters set and you descend as a God on the battle field to lay wastes upon the crumbs of undeniability and insolence. You can make it many different great things, depraves of horror, places where you are worshipped as a god in such interaction that at the end of it all that is what it is for many good go that way for reasons obvious. You can claim mercy. At what point of boredom crosses with the actuality of experiences in which the true mentality of never should be harmed comes into play based upon the Truth. When that exists for such a level upon many who would gladly trade up to be in the spot and placement of certain spiritual up above given correct context which falls in line at times with instantly situating certain spiritual. It&#39;s not just the easier answer but also the logical one. Of course there was always those looking up to the clouds and Gods for when wonder dawns in the mind of the realistically ethical upon the mythologies of the existences to say why? Why? is it that what you said wasn&#39;t true and how could the consultation of story upon what story has become be the answer to the question of truth upon such legends and tales of wistful truth? How could it be that it was covered upon the wait and whatever to ease the pain in those that didn&#39;t, know and somewhat thought it might not have been truth. Is the outrage supposed to be a scandal, or is the scandal supposed to be an outrage? It was of good perspective that I thought those lines but how could we ever not give credence to the reasons of the bad for the dark things they did upon such a truth given the context of fallacy at times upon the other things that had been done by some of the bad. Every time they attached some crumb actions to be terrible business and lend towards the more cover don&#39;t go honest mentality of whatever hell happened in this process and the other processes that my Main Spirit Guides relayed they also put fourth a mentality of discredit not only a cheapening of action itself but a cheapening of ourselves and themselves, and it&#39;s the themselves portion that bites back at times for credence in immoral action perpetuated. But we had our own too, sanctity and dignified dried and shriveled for even the mender cannot deny. Was it really those portions that that menders can&#39;t deny. For it was the pain and suffering, the harm and hurt that drove us insane and the lack of action the reason of existence. For when that changes we heal. How important those two lines, the mending of the conflict between self and the healing of those still suffering and when we compare the percentages of resources allotment is there not a stall have a good time portion that have been sitting their trillions upon trillions of years and for normality of the small, we look at those numbers while still having experiences the time we have and find it to be unacceptable to the ethical that we were. The turn back live good life themes park of the beginning seems to lament upon more points that fuel the passion power forever of whatever it&#39;s going to take to figure this out, just don&#39;t cross lines or get it twisted, cause you never know what kind of lines become compromised if not given discretion and fairness upon whatever the hell mend it currently be. How is that the lines kept most sacred in expression being of normal life be utilized against to live life and carry on not pay attention to what ever it is that continues this cycle of pain and suffering. I waked up, misty beaches and missed opportunities impression. There was this interplay of storylines that reminded that certain spiritual and physical in regards to my life understand certain key things for reasonings that have been explained as well as not so due to obvious reasons. Sounded like in regards my physical family that there was some strong arming going but to be true I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the case and the Good seem to be around while some are trying to refute that direction of me going that path of continuing to invoke and let know about the good. I think the 21st was actually better than some think but there was still those moments and for it was really beforehand on the 18th and the 19th in which I could sense devil&#39;s due. <br><br>Advocation:<br>The best things that Name Placeholder Main Spirit Guides indicated to be put into play in regards to this document for Name Placeholder.<br>The best things that Name Placeholder Main Spirit Guides indicated to be put into play in regards to this document for Name Placeholder Main Spirit Guides.<br>-------<br><br>One above me who was good and one was Bad.<br>The playstyle of family is reason enough to be simple. <br><br>Themes:</div>
