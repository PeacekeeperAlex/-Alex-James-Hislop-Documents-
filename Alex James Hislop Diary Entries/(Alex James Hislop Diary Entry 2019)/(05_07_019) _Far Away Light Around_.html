<div class="title">(05/07/019) &quot;Far Away Light Around&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I was awoken in the night and and there seemed to be certain kinds of attack happening on my life specifically the timeline and then I got shoehorned into this higher up heavenly angelic place where there seem to be awakenings happening potentially to facilitate sleepings that had been happening previous. Then it turned quickly as things were just getting there decent for some into an issue as to whether alex would continue on in regards to working through his life by way of a couple ponderings in regards to Alex Laying down in the spot where he got woken up earlier. I got to work like I knew I would but something got maneuvered away from me, the drive to work through my life but I have continued to prove that that is what I will do. A part of myself was potentially resituated and there was also comedy which was tried to be taken from me but didn&#39;t happen. Then I created the (AJHD) AJH Daily Defensives and Others(defined by my Main Camp) Team Leaders document in the middle of a turbulent and battle that was supposedly happening which then turned the situation into something else, shoehorned in a spot and access to an area where they put certain spirits that did something to cause attack and harm but the truth is that it&#39;s been happening and it proves it. Large happening, energies that can feel like similar to some of the multidimensional communities partially because it might be in a certain manner. Big kind of feeling energies and partially feeling like some got taken off the line and content experiences and existences being feng shuied in a certain kind. Certain kinds emerged and it kind of reminded me of that sort in which I have seen here and there, Main Spirit Guides groups coming into vicinity somewhat insinuated to be of mine about two or three years ago. Spirits using willpower and certain kinds of decision making as an excuse to tether and attack as well as steal in regards to different kinds.Literally for some hiding behind different kind of machinisms to not have to do certain things which is why I sometimes look towards those that my Main Camp indicated and get up upset, you think it builds character fine but when it impeded on mine and others(defined by my Main Camp) defense that becomes something different. Upon receiving a certain post package in which there was tell of something that had happened in regards. I am not certain it has anything to do with the post but I am not sure. There is tells of a certain place has a decent amount of beings in there that supposedly defending and keeping peoples safe. There is care in regards to this new discerned place but certain energy placements I can sense as well intrigue and drama in regards to interaction. I discern certain left group, a certain outside world group, a Ri Culture Group and others(defined by my Main Camp), some of which are trying to get organized in which some of this might be facilitated by way of content experiences strangely enough. There was a tell yesterday about content experience deployment in regards to the Good Kind of Bad accompanied by a black window right after the tell, someone making a getaway potentially with something, something tried to let me know something in regards to my perspective but i don&#39;t think it was that. <br><br>Advocations:<br>Creation in regards to resources pertaining to myself daily. Alternatives that my Main Camp indicated and advocations in regards to the metamorphosis that my Main Camp indicated.<br>THe idea that you can be advanced in Far Away Light in multiple kinds of ways to live multiple lives and get more things done at once. This idea of accords to only be able to do it so much again limiting the ability to be able to save and defend. <br>Dimensional existences and overlaps in regards to when you interact with someone that you interact with multiple spirits at once <br>clarifications in regards to what I am trying to do with my hands, I am wondering if it&#39;s either proximity and vicinity, or my own?<br>Change technology especially in regards to writing <br>Chains of Dimensional Existences especially in regards to when shit rolls around and affect certain Chains that my Main Camp indicated IE: something happens, certain peoples complain and it goes to another dimensional existences, and so on and so fourth. <br>situators and cleaners<br>Digital changers of physical information on physical planet earth especially those that can change the physical digital and behind the scenes information. <br>Inspiration <br>Team Leader Disclaimers that my Main Camp indicated in regards to AJH Daily Defensives and others(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. <br>Those immorality family vendettas and immorality working together, the dividers and glue. <br>immorality quotas<br>alternatives<br>defense in regards to those that promote immorality and morality in the ways that my Main Camp indicated<br>in regards to those that approach immorality in the ways that my Main Camp indicated <br>Lenses and how they can be harmful in regards to understanding in regards to multiple sides but also how they can help in regards to multiple sides. <br>Team Leader Disclaimers<br>Morale society and immoral society content experiences specifically in regards to invasion<br>Immorality Intellect and Guidance as well as check personnel<br>Bigs affected by our interaction<br>Settings in regards to interaction and the possibility of toning down the censors that my Main Camp indicated in regards to Immorality and others<br>those trying to research everything, technology updates<br><br>Defense: <br>You take a look at certain places, that might not fully realize the power in advocations, testifications, disclaimers, accords, edicts, putting certain information into play, communication, mechanisms work, callwords, things of that nature. Then you take a look at the power of one of them realizing this alone and then the power when he creates those sort off things, you lump all of the bad in regards to it and some in regards to potential of it and then you compare the good. You take some of facilitating  factors out of the mix, like existences put into play to facilitate things look like they are being done in the manners that my Main Spirit Guides indicated if possible and compare the good and bad of it and then you analyze how those facilitating factors, especially how those facilitating factors are decent and indecent. The idea though remains for some that if there is so much damage in regards to some of it then how do we proceed especially if it is needed. <br>We need the content experience and existence access we need to be able to promote the kinds of immorality and others(defined by my Main Camp) that we need to be able to be who we want to be, if not then the violence for some is going to continue and promotions of what my Main Camp indicated will continue as well. We can facilitate with the gravity needed to be able to pull of the entertainment that my Main Camp indicated and for those existences that my Main Camp indicated, we need to be able to look to the things that would change our minds in regards to limiting creation in the places that need that bread and games the way my Main Camp indicated. - (Digital movers and shakers - What do you have behind the scenes information that is along these lines in a decent best possible way?)<br>Advocations in regards to those that I have harmed. <br><br>My Far Away Light selves that my Main Camp indicated beliefs are big apart of my process and My Light selves beliefs and energies are a big part of my process, the non-reflecting of those statements at times has been a truth in which I find disconcerting. <br><br>Medical Observation: <br>Weightless in the hands and arms like someone keeping me in my body when it felt weightless, like it could fly out of my body without certain kind of saving and tethering, potentially ghost related as it was insinuated yesterday in regards to certain kinds of ghosting. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for intervention and saving in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. Certain resources being utilized to keep my strength up and energy levels up, pointing towards utilization of certain resources indicated that attack has happened and certain kinds of metamorphosis has taken place. My grip strength has been affected in certain ways and I feel like other-dimensional in regards to that are potentially doing certain things. There has been this idea that I was uncombined in a certain manner to be able to do more at once pertaining to what my Main Camp indicated especially in regards to the hands areas but I am not certain that is the case.
