<div class="title">(04/28/2019) &#39;The Revelation of Truth&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>I had a dream in a certain areas where I was like going to a scenes in regards to It: Chapter 2 or another It film where I was practicing saying Georgie and then I remember being pinned against a metal grate on top of a building with a dude shoving some sort of space gun in my face. then there was this feeling of being moved upwards, like I Was climbing on the roof of my ceiling and I can still feel a certain awareness and live that this is the case in which I am climbing on the ceiling in other dimensional. There was this let know before I went to bed a moving of certain mechanisms and personnel. A decision had been made with all of the convening that was seemingly already happening in a certain manner. I remember prompting what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to fathers and other ilk in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated which started talking about the events that were happening spiritually. Earlier there was this let know that somehow from the past I did something about the current situations which some were trying to label and have happen that peoples were getting attacked, it was said multiple times that I got attacked ubt again those tactics in which have been happening in regards to making everybody think I have been attacked and then revelation in regards to that I haven&#39;t been attacked to potentially drive someone mad or to attack myself, this tactic has been utilized the past 2 - 3 days on my end and others(defined by my Main Camp) partially to tuck under the rug the real damage that has been happening but also to potentially save in a certain manner if some are being attacked for something not making a certain grade. I got attacked in a certain manner upon leaving the computer room office of 42 Franklin Beach Road at a certain point and I did do some stuff yesterday. I modified the History Disclaimers on the Peacekeeperalex Trello Account and I did create some decent groupings of advocationals. There was this moment where I put my hands together to bring fourth those moments in the kitchen of myself in the past supposedly being present insinuated to be from a Far Away Light kind of way although in a certain capacity with the father and other ilk moments where there was talking points and conversation.  The strange thing of this all is that I don&#39;t think war and targetings were going to take the fall and if it wasn&#39;t so damn not personal I would think it to be a certain business aspect but those two didn&#39;t necessarily fit the bill either. It was mixed bag I feel and the truth is this stems from spiritual events which are taking place at least on my end seemingly but in other processes as well. There has been a Tug Of War over my process in regards to certain group revealed said to be on my side but something stinks and it&#39;s not necessarily that they are not on my side. But rather we have met at a certain point, which might have to do with the insinuation that a certain part of Long Game in regards to this process seemingly changed. This point where certain spirits put too much stock at times in regards to myself instead of hearing my Main Spirit GUides and the continued issue and theme of not having enough communication in which is sometimes there to facilitate certain processes which can feel null and void when the percentage of the existences agree in the manner that my Main Spirit Guides indicated but potentially isn&#39;t especially if we are trying to mend in a certain manner. There has been this arguing and disagreement or at least insinuated on my end in regards to painless dissolving into certain dimensional afterlife and other kinds similar in which some might consider powerful majic and advanced technology, the kind that can instantly transport you to different kinds of dimensional existences but also in which there is potentially brimstone and seemingly brimstone attachments. I wrote some reddit posts, facebook post and twitter posts about some of the supposebly future interactions. Within the past 15 minutes some thing was attacked, felt like a membrane and I felt a snapping in regards to an outer layer that my Main Camp indicated that some insinuated had to do with a certain being overlapping in regard to myself and others(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to feeling uncomfortable eating with foods, this lingering hands feeling that felt like a subtle phobia in regards to having dirty hands. Something was revealed, I felt certain scrolls taken from the areas in regards to what I thought was a being and the being might be ok, I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for the beings that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the foods phobias that my Main Camp indicated especially the one that was seemingly harmed to be protected the way my Main Camp indicated. There was also this rushing feeling and I could feel the skull portion of my upper head area as well as spirits rushing into the right hand area where the puncture might happened. <br><br>Sunset Grill:<br>Conversing with and responding in regards to learning in what my Main Camp indicated as my <br><br>Advocationals:<br>Those lives that were stolen that my Main Camp indicated.<br>Update Technology.<br>Those beings that no longer want to be in the places that my Main Camp indicated. Bring them where my Main Camp indicated in the ways that my Main Camp indicated.<br>Fame Processes where we can feng shui fame to alternative processes in the ways that my Main Camp indicated.<br>Advocationsi n regards to those trying to choose the good life and being on my side as well as others that my Main Camp indicated <br>Advocationals for more time that my Main Camp indicated in regards to those that are trying to help me for real the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>Compensation in regards to the stolen moments and life as well as others that my Main Camp indicated in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated and myself the way my Main Camp indicated. <br>Creation and protection in regards to the hands that my Main Camp indicated and impressions that my Main Camp indicated.<br>Those mending the seems that are seemingly breaking<br>those that are facilitating time in regards to the good guys that my Main Camp indicated. There was a larger food phobia in regards to my hand areas when handling belles food and belles bottles. I have felt more things in regards to this layer, some of which happens to do with channeling and there is other kinds of stuff happening at times, an idea of being seperated in a certain sense in regards to certain society in certain but also I felt this subtle healing movement as well that can seemingly mend and situate this overlapping layer potentially affected. External Layering or External Wrapper in regards to this kind of stimuli that kind of feels like a wavy membrane. There has been a certain kind of interaction in regards to authority which speaks of being careful the way my Main Camp indicated but doesn&#39;t seem worried. It was said to mean something but I am unsure of what it might fully mean. <br>Strategical placement of advocationals and runes <br>Colour overlaps in regards to the advocationals and runes.<br><br><br>Idea:<br>Skyrim meets Total War Warhammer, and you got to do like quests to gain access to certain kinds of total war style frameworks but like first person mode can happen where you stumble upon the scale of total war battles. Spirit lamented that there was such a game that already existed.<br>Certain gaming systems where you can flip through lore and create universe and worlds populate by both for some bots and living spirit in the manners that my Main Camp indicated. Custom bots and avatars created to add to the world with back story and characters. Applying lore to different customizable setting, like making a pure warhammer style world with elements of elder scroll skyrim style gameplay mixed with total war style gameplay. Or mixing the lore of Elder scroll s and warhammer to create a new universe, one that already exist fused together with ancient lore as to how that happened, potentially evolution as well as history or even certain events that leads to two to collide. <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
