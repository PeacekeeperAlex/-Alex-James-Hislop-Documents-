<div class="title">(02/08/2019) &quot;There is a lot of spirits at times who have been through a lot&quot; </div>
<div class="content">Activity: Again I feel the pull to talk about certain subject which can be turbulent but to be quite honest there not that big of a thing if you aim my communications where my Main Spirit Guides indicated and in my culture we talk about conspiracies, not being able to talk about certain things is considered a freedom of rights issue. You disagree? ok, fine but I am also in my own on my own planet and yeah, I do try to help, tell me there is no reason to help? You can&#39;t say that, where is the access needed in regards to those just from a basic rights standpoint where is the safety if those rights aren&#39;t just about defense? Yeah people do get upset and insulted at times from certain actions, I apologize for mine. If there is no problem then there shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Again, some spirits try to make it personal but there is only so much to work with and the truth of the matter is I have worked out a lot of my issues on my end spiritually, a lot of the personal is gone through I feel, making more personal, there is a thing on that and it&#39;s quite unfair when I am trying to get alongi n a certain regardless of my viewpoints and when people target in certain ways especially in regards to not even being able to let know of said viewpoint it can make it look like more of a problem, especially coupled with the viewpoints.Multiple groups fighting at certain levels with me stuck in the god damn mix, i am not certain it&#39;s a decent, especially if I am from up there or a place where large conversation in regards to life tracks as writing NDE portion of the my website, it feels like a make strides and move through certain barriers at times in regards to just conversation and shooting the shit with hypotheticals and things of that nature potentially more so. I felt a certain kinds of understanding that an aspect in regards to my learning and personality needed more time to be able to develop as I was looking at ATS and BTS as forum website, there was an insinuation that I was an elder being or an older being that need more time to develop and then I felt myself shy away from that part of myself and it felt like there a certain question posed in a certain way that i didn&#39;t fully catch, it was whether I was going to a certain spot to develop more, I shied away from that and I shook my head in answer how i felt but not my answer fully and then something was moved, I felt this part of myself for a moment that was grabbed and taken somewhere I got upset because i thought  it might have been my anti-camp, I felt the ability to move certain areas kinds of personality and/or mentalities as to that in which was moved from me except in the direction of the right, I didn&#39;t fully choose to do it but in the moment I was upset and wanted people to know what I was experiencing in a certain way, right after I apologized and let know and did advocations for their protection, I am not certain if certain personalities were affected in regards to my anti-camp and others, but it&#39;s now been insinuated that something good had happened and a concept emerges. The concept of your personalities changing and aging in certain kinds of way.There was a certain kind of switch and there are those who need to be somewhere we have been doing communications and asking in multiple kinds of ways and it&#39;s said that there are people on the way in an incarnation sort of way as well other kinds of ways too, I am not certain it wasn&#39;t fully decent. I feel like spirit and beings that my Main Camp indicated are using the event and pushing me upwards and out of certain areas by way of how at times I have been operating, some of my viewpoints and heck I it&#39;s even been talked about in certain ways that Apocalyptic events have been invoked at times by way of not wanting to deal with me and others. I think that sort of thing is insane. I was listening to coast to coast am and I felt certain kinds of reaction and more proof that audio can be feng shuied in a certain kind of way, where when we listen to something multiple times that there can be differences with different kinds of informational embedment and one of the things i Notices on this episodes and potentially others was anti-camp culture responses in the audio itself not necessarily being as prevalent and there as it once was there was fixed in regards to certain reaction and ripple affect but there is also a bit of feng shui of blame going on in that regard to certain extent. <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.

Clickable links like the show all actions on the Peacekeeperalex trello account and attachments section where upon me clicking links shows up on my screen has been at times shoehorned into a spot where some in the spirit think that it needs to be shown in order for it to work. If I never traverse to Google.ca that doesn&#39;t mean that it doesn&#39;t exist in the public especially the spiritually that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The data upon clicking some of those links on the peacekeeperalex trello account and the Alex James Hislop Documents on Github are public regardless of whether I click them or not, they have public links in which exist online especially in regards to the Spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
