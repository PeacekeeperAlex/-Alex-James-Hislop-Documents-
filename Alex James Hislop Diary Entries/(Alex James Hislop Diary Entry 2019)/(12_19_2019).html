<div class="title">(12/19/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I don&#39;t know what this life is at times. Some of the things they have portrayed to me and some the ways they have operated have made me not trust certain kinds of spirit. Maybe some of it is a lie and God I hope it is but I don&#39;t feel some of it to be. When you notice defensives put into play for your life because of the kinds of terrible stuff that can supposedly exist or has existed in which when you look at the defensives and safeguards would be the kind of stuff that is of nightmares. I have noted traps within my process at times. A certain spirit works against me in a certain capacity. Maybe that spirit does something that someone considers over the line. It is then revealed that it was over the line, sometimes after the fact, sometimes during and maybe sometimes before. Where that spirit has then fallen into the trap. The way certain physical human view things in earth-based societies is a question as to how and why there needs to be a trap upon understanding morality and ethical. The question as to where anywhere else is it somehow acceptable for certain kinds of actions to be happening and why does there need to be a certain amount of actions already have happen to be able to say that is too far when we are already past too far. I come from this culture and I asked myself what kind of actions already took place in this process during this life to have it be said that somehow when certain spirits try to attack me or others that somehow there has already been too much of what some spirits tried to do later on in which supposedly caused incarceration and punishment. One of the biggest questions is whether some spirits are basing this off the fact that I have defended myself in this life and I have, and whether there using this in the outside world against people who have supposedly not defended themselves in the life dimensional. It&#39;s another reason why we need to trust spiritual information and defensives behind the scenes because we can&#39;t sacrifice that in which we fully rely on because one of us in front of the scenes starts to create defense works. What became acceptable in certain places and holding on to of what once was is seen but not fully understood. Where actions that some would never find to be acceptable becoming reality and every day dealings impressing upon some of those overlapping. When did some of our guardians turn into something else. Wouldn&#39;t you look at those in which are sometimes at the mercy of by way of dimensional overlap. Like if in the physical we had an in front of the scenes dimensionals in which we could see and interact with and we could affect their health by way of interaction. What kind of responsibility does that create upon ourselves in regards to the way we operate in regards to that in front of the scenes other-dimensional. What kind of responsibility does it create upon finding out and knowing that the are other-dimensionals that rely upon our own health in front of the scenes. The things they keep portraying to me is that some knew a life like this was going to emerge and that certain spirit did things in the past in regards to this life. But they got it wrong. Is it truly because I defended myself? It helps but i think the kicker is that it never deserved some of the actions that have been perpetuated and there was spiritual attack in this life when it happened. For it to be said that what was needed was that to take place because there were those in the past that perpetuated acts and that there might be those in the future that question the present and past as to why they didn&#39;t do more should have been responded with that it doesn&#39;t deserve the actions that you are requesting that you felt needed to have happen and that the resources saved would have been better off somewhere else but not really. It&#39;s not good enough for me and it&#39;s not good enough for those that my Main Spriit Guides indicated because it&#39;s baseline stuff. People get angry, you can&#39;t expect the not to be with finding out some of the darker things that exist. I never said who I was speaking towards with some of the potshot comments if that&#39;s what&#39;s going to be claimed for the kinds of attacks that have happened. I am within my right to created the defense works that my Main Spriit Guides indicated because they can decided on their end what it pertains too. They can facilitate that kind of thing in which says certain defenders and informational creators are not receiving the resources and protection to go as far as they need too in regards to their creation, construction and other kinds pertaining to my informational creation and others(defined by my main Spirit Guides). I don&#39;t feel there is anything wrong with putting an Earth-Based disclaimer into play or any of the other informational placements I have done as it only pertains to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light. The mundane actions in our lives if certain spirit attach actions towards them? The different between consent and non-consent. We look at our lives and we see certain spiritual attachment in regards to some of our actions. We can go for a walk and there is positive attachment in the way that our Main Spirit Guides and Main Authorities found agreeable within the confines of consent. We looked at that and found it to be decent. There is a karmic understanding in that and if it isn&#39;t Kosher it&#39;s understood too because the light is monitoring our actions. If there is a spirit that attaches to our actions in which we did not consent or like, that is understood too. Do we deserve to lose karma because a spirit attached a negative action to one of our actions? No. Given context.  What then though is the responsibility in regards to attached actions to our own? specially when looking at it from the confines of consent. What is thew Karma involved and what is the other kinds involved?<br><br>- (Again while watching content experience some reveal of certain kinds of storylines and things of that nature also corresponding with certain family members passing and an attachment regarding some of those that have passed on in my defense and things of that nature acknowledged in certain interactions upon one of my family members passing. It felt like multiple kinds of good were in vicinity with a certain kind of cover. A spirit from 2016 was around but it seemed to be a smoke and mirrors. One of the topics was 9/11 and there was a interaction in regards to dimensional deployment in which was one of the discussions. It felt like a spirit of physical was around as well. There was spirit that came around having to do with Banners and the kinds of things they have been doing in regards to loved ones especially female. There was also another spirit around in what some have been doing in regards to another subject, some of there subject I don&#39;t even understand like different genders I have never seen different concepts I have never fully understood by way of never being taught or having an understanding in regards to that sort of thing.)<br>- (There is something going on when I have been watching movies. There was a n interaction formally but after I watched Glass it changed. Something took place. A truth was understood and it was done in a decent way. I think it was soft truth in regards to some of the things that have been taking place, some of the situations, some of the things people have been through a reveal especially in regards to the extraordinary. But maybe there was some hard truths in the mix, maybe there needed to be and maybe there going to be regardless of my presence on this planet. It speaks of something else happening other than just what I am doing, other than what just I am involved in.)<br><br>Themes: #Apocalyptics #MoversAndShakersOfDimensions #Sports #Situations  #Change #Inspiration #Destruction#TearingDown #Stealing #Thieves #Banners #Time   </div>
