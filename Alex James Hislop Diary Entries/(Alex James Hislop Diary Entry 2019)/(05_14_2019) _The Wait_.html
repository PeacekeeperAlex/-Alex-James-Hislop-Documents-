<div class="title">(05/14/2019) &quot;The Wait&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>Yesterday continued to experience different kinds of stimuli like being moved to areas where certain anti-camps at times doing there thing would find certain pursuits to be uncomfortable. One of cleanest energy fields I have experiences thus far and I apologize for some of my output in regards to certain energies although I also feel that that too is fairly clean these days for what&#39;s acceptable. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for what my Main Camp indicated in regards to ideas and the kinds of stuff that happens upon writing information, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.It&#39;s been quite decent on my end, not too many bad stuff insinuated to have been happening. I am worried about the conflicts though as I kind of feel like some are ignoring it but I have continued to do advocations here and there, I think some have the wrong idea in regards to that potentially stemming from something else but the real true is that I do things in a supporting capacity, verbal advocations here and there, sometimes putting documents into play and written advocations, of course there is always callwords work which certain spirits have been identifying that I could do more of. One of the key things thought is the utilization of certain events to harm and somehow insinuate because of certain morality promotions and seemingly lack of immorality that somehow those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated deserve to be attacked. Now it&#39;s not said often enough about all of the positivity and decent going ons in which does exist. You&#39;ll have a place that experience a long time of positivity not lamented upon as much as when it happen in regard to the negative and in my physical earth based society that sort of makes sense to a certain degree as their is sometimes a focus on the negative by it&#39;s nature. So I think in understanding that there has been positive things happening might be decent but that there are also positivities being utilized against peoples at times. Heck for some they want to experience certain stuff when they get to certain places. I wonder how many people have been harmed in regards to the past seven days in which has felt like a certain kind of time period. I just want this to be over, I am tired of it and I don&#39;t want to experience things that I don&#39;t want to experience. I want to be able to be who I want to be without being attacked in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I want to be able to promote what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. How long ago was it reminded in regards to the length of time that spirits and people have been trying to figure out what at times we turned into. You can&#39;t blame those that don&#39;t want to see any of you anymore. I want to go to the Areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to the Original Light that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) want to go to the areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to the Original Light that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Really strange impressions being placed upon me said to have been partially from certain specials storyline in regards to tells like that there might be other like me on this physical planet earth potentially born in the 80s or that they are the odd man out but one i feel it might be has to do with trying to get people to think i was born in the 80s potentially a decent as well as not so. I realized there were bigs in regards to certain famous impressions regarding the things on earth, there was a conversation in regards to 1980s impressions and gaming culture where somebody decided to leave that is a big one. I did verbal advocastions for reasons why people that my Main Spirit Guides indicated get along to be displayed when my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated. There was also this idea of it being 1989 the actual year as a conversation metaphorical ubt it might have been something different. <br>self-regents. Those that are done with facilitating certain kinds of life saving by way of not living the life that they want too. The amount of reasons as to why that is from the lying and backstabbing to the potential worse. Those that do things in way in which certain societal like and tolerate and those that used too conflict. Main Spirit Guides <br><br>Advocationals:<br>buttons presses in regards to certain existences, like placing a reinforcements button at the top of building or a natural setting quality in which some would need to traverse there to press that reinforcements button. Imagine all kinds of machinisms in regards to this sort of thing. Life repairs.That sort of systems where you have multiple kinds of life which some of which might be buffer in the manners that my Main Spirit Guides indicated as well as emergency ones and just in cases personnel in which can be a part of the setup as well as other kinds in which when sometimes attacked are there for a reason as well in regards to other situations. There is different kinds of maneuvers and within the past couple days there has been said to have something happen where people would be standing there after battle where it literally went to the ending people that are technically not the ones suppose to be harmed but we all know there are others that are not suppose to be harmed as well in which some of which were not saved. I hope they are ok and it&#39;s some of the stuff that happened this past week. This isn&#39;t just in regards to dimensional existences where there is an emphasis in regards to kind of setup explained but also in other places where it might not necessarily be as noticed as others(defined by my Main Camp). Nation Content experiences in regards to single being being metaphorical representations of nation and countries. Switching certain Games up, giving it a refresher every so often. Distractions, smokes and mirrors spirits. Choosing kind of stuff. preparation in regards to this life? What were the preparations in regards to this life? Light, do what my Main Camp indicated always the way my Main Camp indicated. Inventory listers and scribes. Regulars in the process. future events invoked and knowing something is going to happen and basing actions in regards to it. caravans, slow downers pertaining to systems of certain immorality promotion access, action lenders and immorality debtors. Those that are having difficulty with me not being harmed and/or being in certain areas as well as alternatives to be able to facilitate that sort of thing. The Intimacy Goblin Frameworks that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Those that allow people and spirit to respond how they want too without having to worry about ripple affect augmentation.<br>Reputationally defended in regards to certain bigs that can take a lot of resources and things of that nature, reputational defense teams. Depression and sadness. stacks of things that need to be addressed in regards to the defense of peoples, like people dealing with intimacy abuse, life stealing, harm and suffering, all of their allpersonal harm, suffering, immorality non consented in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated : in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated creating advocations, testifications, accords, clarifications, Disclaimers.<br><br>I am Alex James Hislop. My Main Camp is my Main Spirit Guides. I and Others(defined by my Main Camp) as well as those that my Main Camp indicated are advocating for what my Main Camp indicated in regards to Morality overpromotion tactics especially to invoke immorality that my Main Camp indicated way my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for our advocations, clarifications, disclaimers, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) to be utilized, used, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. My Main Camp&#39;s current information, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to these advocations, information, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) takes priority the way my Main Camp indicated.
