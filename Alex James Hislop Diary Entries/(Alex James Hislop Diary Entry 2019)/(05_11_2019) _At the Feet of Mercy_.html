<div class="title">(05/11/2019) &quot;At the Feet of Mercy&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>I woke up and felt attacked spiritually in a certain manners which lead to events and me putting certain things into play. I felt Like I was in the present but with the way things be set who knows if that&#39;s that case. There is different feelings and impressions in regards to present, almost a certain kind of live with certain kind of tones. The changing of these impressions and perception from the future also can make it difficult which happened as I wrote this. It seems to me that there is a certain kind of war taking place and insinuated multiple times to be that but something I am not fully certain on and also not something to be able to say as to why something was feng shuied in such a fashion I feel, people write Diary Entries, even as viewed as mine are spiritually, it exists and it makes it look like a certain kind of conflict is taking place by the feng shui of certain things. Feels like a battle for Earth Commenced and I really should shut up at times but I am not arguing God forgive but rather upset, I was supposedly attacked but I am wondering who continues to get attacked supposedly in regards to myself, hey you are tired of it? then shut up about it, you don&#39;t like me talking about me getting attacked then no more chatter about me getting attacked over my channel. The real truth is that I have said some upsetting stuff, like do your damn job and under the breath bonehead sort of stuff, jeez I am sorry. But it aint got shit to do with it, it can&#39;t have shit to do with it literally, it&#39;s not enough. Radio Free Earth, I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for what my Main Camp indicated in regards to Radio Free Earth, the way my Main Camp indicated. Something was put into my eyes spiritual that potentially holds memories or certain kinds of imagery as well as information or other kinds that affected the channel. There was a lot of different things happen. Things escalated not this time because of any comment but rather the events that happen around me spiritually, I felt earth attacked and battle ensue which I prompted defense. This one kind of felt like a certain kinds was around me, a certain kind similar to skadavroosh, lieutenants and what certain spirit have been dealing with behind the scenes which makes it strange that they came around me, there was the questions as to the next step up either in content experiences and existence interaction potentially trying to interact with some of the process alternatives, mine in particular I wonder about but I am not certain if that happened. The consensus on my experiences this day is that there was a certain kind of battle take place in regards to the Freedom of Earth. I have noticed puzzle pieces and feng shui in regards to process interaction where like five months from now I could have another experience and partial interaction in regards in which is an extension off of this day. Some say storyline and other say events but one things is clear though that there is dimensional existence that don&#39;t fully play it that way or at least seemingly on my end which lends towards how they fared this day on multiple sides. Heck some choose to experience certain storylines and events in a certain manners as to speak to a certain kind of coherency. <br><br>Groups this day in which seemingly had to do with Jeff Cripino at times and other members of my Family, although I kind of felt like it was a smoke and mirrors in which was to infiltrate certain aspects of my Family although there is a storyline that say s that they are my family. Reminds me a bit of Skadavroosh a being in which at times has potentially invoked certain kinds of crazy. Certain Authority Lieutenants and this mixing of the darker sides of my family was happening which then potentially shifted to hollywood as well as others, I am worried that the joes are affected as well. <br><br>I created the GitHub Repository in regards to the Alex James Hislop Documents and the (AJHD) information. I also created the (AJHD) information that my Main Camp indicated in regards to Earth-Based Physical Digital, Earth-Based Digital as well as GitHub and Radionomy information earlier in my attempt to upload the AJH Radio Free Earth information in which was then done on Reddit in which there was Reddit master information was already in play. <br><br>Defense:<br>Permissions in regards to creating events around me and others(defined by my Main Camp) for future potentials in regards to myself and others(defined by my Main Camp). Things that are forced to do things off of my wordings, healers forced heal a certain amount on my advocations or worse, ones that don&#39;t understand fully, please, someone needs to protect them, maintenance and repair, as well as the monster tamers and animals squads that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the beasts and wild spirits. <br>psychiatry safety<br>Tethering of other dimensional family to the lives of the physical, I and others(defined by my Main Camp) choose what my Main Camp indicated in regards to this the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>My Actions and the utilization of my actions and others(defined by my Main Camp) speaking towards the importance of why my process needs to be understood and the routes I am deciding to go down in the ways the my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>Those amateur and young processes seemingly out there in regards to support, coherency and guidance as well as awareness in the manners that my Main Spirit GUides indicated.<br>Buffers<br>Truthers out there that my Main Spirit Guides Indicated as well as recognizing that the Truth is fairly the status quo in certain areas if not more than that, remember dimensional existences exist in which Might the larger portion of the multidimensional communities that are espousing the truthi n events and things of that nature. <br>Taking frameworks spiritually behind the scenes and basing it off my disclaimers and groupings disclaimers, testifications <br><br>Storyline:<br>Earth Freedom Events and storyline (05/11/2019)<br>(Main Spirit Guides, Alex-PC Interaction Advocation, Escalation and Acceleration and Deceleration partially said to be based off of Space Research in regards to heightening process yesterday, Personality Change and wake up call in regards to being kind and less chirpy)<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. Light; Do what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to these advocations the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
