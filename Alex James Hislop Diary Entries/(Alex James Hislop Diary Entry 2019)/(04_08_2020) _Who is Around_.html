<div class="title">(04/08/2020) &quot;Who is Around&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I have explained this in Past Diary Entries as is such for some of the information I have been letting, you might see in one book there being an explanation through one of my diary entries that touch upon again. How do I let know of a culture that exists spiritually that does crazy things to help and not help but also those that do it for the way of life itself. That Jackass Culture exists on societal level that you never thought possible and that there is overlap dimensional and culture regarding this Earth-Based that exists. I wanted to know what one of the calendar looks from some of them espoused. The kinds of every day nonsensical written in the squares and special stuff on holidays, skiing down a mountain top on a Christmas tree or attaching oneself to a rocket being launched into the sky to floatable phallic jump chutes expanded. There are ones that are less intense like traveling across the ocean on a makeshift sleigh ride but sometimes lack of intensity doesn&#39;t always indicate the kind of adventures garnered. Think of going on a dark walk for Halloween full of cartwheels and stilts but other-dimensional versions of such and grander lot more. Traveling to speed of sound in safe manner but jet leg afterwards activities providing entertainment and stupidity. There was a stint not too long ago where a certain kind of leader came around providing his crazy antics and sometimes I have seen this culture get utilized to smoke and mirrors but it isn&#39;t always as such. There are those that save spiritual by way of acting crazy and outlandish. When you look at spiritual stats, you can&#39;t deny such an existence of lend from such a Concept for what&#39;s acceptable. For some that might have to do with the fact that there is a darker kind that doesn&#39;t do it to save but for darker reasonings. Think of all of the Good Gods and how some mythologies point towards darker Gods. It&#39;s not unheard for there to be darker aspects of certain Concepts. That doesn&#39;t mean there always is but it is a tell seen on this planet, notes of realism but also how it&#39;s told and spoken of and the societal perception regarding can matter. <br><br>My ventures of adding words dictionaries seems to be befitting of an explanation regarding expanded English. Different kinds of emergence regarding such a language in which partially did Originate on Physical Earth-Based. Some of things seen in regards to such a topic that had been talked about weeks previous to this in movement regarding English. How there is a look from of the logical who looked at the words of English in a certain manner to provide more meanings to some of the words that can be and are. Imagine a certain wording we see daily in English but is not actually considered a word physically but spiritually is considered a word. We see it daily through English in what some would think is a word. Think of Mentality and Personality and the terminology of Ality. I looked at it from the perspective of other kind of interaction changes similarly noted to mentality and personality and some have looked at some of the other-dimensional life and anatomical structures regarding such a terminology in which reflected literal movement of variables in which impacted housing structures of anatomical regarding interaction. Mental being not only an area for some, although in this context the Ality portion sometimes seen as spiritual and other-dimensional with ability for many to impact such an area, but also potentially other-dimensional life regarding. Both the Mental and Mentality potentially are life related, we see it through life and experience it through life but my psychic conversations and psychic stimuli tell me that there is smalls regarding Ality able to maneuver to the mental in regards to mentality. I have literal been able to feel spiritual movements back and fourth form mentality areas and personality areas in multiple degrees. I have felt that there is life in regards to mental and that there is spiritual influences regarding. How to I explain some of the self awareness in regards to some of my own anatomical at times in what some of the spiritual have done around me. <br><br>Spiritual and other-dimensional culture around in what looked to be yesterday a line traverse towards me, spiritual and other-dimensional fighting in which I have discerned a certain kind of creed but certainly not the only one where spiritual and other-dimensional work together. We have seen spiritual in regards to other dimensional and how some banners view it to be in line with the banner itself given dimensional context. We hadn&#39;t seen this line too much even though it had been probably brought up before. <br><br>Lines talked about yesterday and a spiritual having to do with higher light and higher dimensional coming around days previous and there has been those movements interesting as they are in which have had to do with communication and connection regarding spiritual and other-dimensional, it was the same that reminded of when I had a private conversation not labelled as such regarding.<br><br>Another one talked about is the beginnings and endings in how some view it. I am one of those ones that got upset at some of the emergence of immorality. This real stuff right? The look in regards saying that isn&#39;t is difficult to reconcile with the idea that there would be moments where immorality emerges in which is a shootout to previous if there was. For some it mattered as to if it was the true beginning and it might be. But I am one of those who talks about different subject including beginnings and their is history around me at times. <br><br>There has been this look of certain kind trying to disrupt me, trying to disrupt spiritual within my process and targeting work load but also ways of life. We shouldn&#39;t have to use this amount of resources to be able to record a gaming content on my end. There is a difference between certain kind tagging along in regards to their own gaming content especially considering interaction between gaming contents. It wasn&#39;t just about gaming, there was a segway regarding my regular content creation and the kinds of stuff happening regarding I find to not be acceptable in regards to what i sometimes experiencing spiritually. There are many who have been decent but I am wondering what is some of the lines need brought up regarding this writing pertaining. <br><br>Something might have happened on the second or third and there was this scary moment upon nighttime discourse. A moment where the dimensional when my tree presented a large amount body of emotions overlapping the entire physical of my tree a similar kind of stimuli only it was in regards to the planet itself for a portion, it might have been dimensional overlap to stave but they said it had to do with the planet and more to do with something else. It was like a certain dimensional overlap regarding earth found it unacceptable going certain paths changed, like it felt like the planet was a being that started moving and was going to turn violent if certain course of actions were taken. I could feel it but it changed and didn&#39;t go that direction supposedly.<br><br>Certain kinds of attack happening in regards to other-dimensional area where I could feel anger and erratic movement in dance.<br><br>I have felt informational updates and knowledge in regards to my infrastructure in which was invoked near a psychic phenomenon in which felt as such, retaining and attaining information, some of which was to defend certain spiritual through me so said. It was interesting that my simplistic still stands even with advanced information about at times but I am hoping this isn&#39;t utilized against. Another thing talked about was the informational I am experiencing in regards to my spirit even regarding information that I don&#39;t fully know or understand that is being given towards me spiritually, like utilizing me in a certain context to store information or pass information along. How many other machinisms exist regarding this? Many kinds. Which is why I don&#39;t know why I need to be utilized as such for a large portion of informational exchanges and the truth is that certain kind use those alternatives at times too instead of me which makes sense. There was a police connotation and the United Nations Spiritual that my Main Spriit Guides indicated have designated areas, technology and even certain kinds of spiritual and otherwise to alleviate the need to exchange certain kinds of informational through me. <br><br>Certain events taking hold and an emphasis yesterday to try and get me to seem like I want to leave but I don&#39;t know if some fell for it. It&#39;s like I have been saying, I am still working on my life in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Either way. Regardless.<br><br>Morality talked about these days, they had an overlap and I did a speech.

I had brought up morality and going to good in a certain manner. </div>
