<div class="title">(08/20/2019) &quot;Not Good Enough&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity<br>- So a couple things I noticed, Energy levels affected this day and still not getting the energy I need or drive to go the path that I want to go, also another thing that was having difficulty at times although potentially not as bad was certain points being included in certain overlap pertaining to the information I have been writing down in my Diary Entries. Like some suppressing those points being included at times but also content experience creation energies and mechanisms. <br>- Those experiencing my life and the hardships regarding, when is that going to be situated fairly and when exactly is someone going to just look past the bullshit and understand quality of life. Better alternative? How am I suppose to be fine with that upon the utilization of such lines in what some predict to happen in the future regarding myself, that I let some just get attacked through me in a certain regards and never mind side stepping that sort of things that has to do with being comfortable in regards to peoples being attacked in regards to my life. What is the solution?<br>- Giving those that my main Spirit Guides indicated something to do. <br>- Something I discerned on that day I went in my backyard, some spirit coming around taking names, look to be someone who was innocent on my end potentially having to do it, looking for specials to blame in regards to certain events taking place in which one of the storyline on my end is that some of those events were going to be taking place anyhow. A conglomerate should be put into play in regards to blaming specials and things of that nature in regards to the events taking place especially in regards to smalls and side characters of the play. Some negative types tried to spin a tale about how my Main Spirit Guides that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light had harmed certain kind as well that they were no longer my Main Spirit Guides when that is not the case. They also tried to say how  those that my Main Camp indicated in the Light were somehow my Main Spirit Guides when that is not the case but something potentially happened to them as well, I am not certain. I went with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light in this particular moment that happened within the past couple hours, August, 20th, 2019 the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light if not the entire day pertaining to August, 20th, 2019. Those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light can ask my perspective what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light. One of the things they were trying to do was confuse a situations in regards to certain defense pertaining to myself, they said I got attacked and that Family got attacked, I need what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light. My interaction being utilized this way was not supposed to happen during these moments in which might lament upon some not wasting time in the channel in regards to trying to help the situations. <br>- They also said in another spot I was either psychological influenced to act a certain way or i went upwards and someone was pretending to be me indicating higher light attack or finding out what the hell was happening. <br><br>Advocationals:<br>- Continuing to secure Coherency and Power in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding myself and analyzing what exactly is being taken away from me and for what reasonings. For example, I get to an area where I can choose to intervene but because some have labelled this something it potentially isn&#39;t I don&#39;t have access to be able to do that or make that decision. The kinds of power that they have been taking away from me at times needs to be understood in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I am not certain this is as much as some think it is in regards to the Amount of Power taken away from me. I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for what my Main Spirit Guides indicated daily and in future litigation skipping over this diary entry I consider it to be what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>- Protection in regards to myself pertaining to dimensionals that can affect physicals with physical diseases and ailments. <br>- Life utilization in regards to this life and lives of those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, basing what my Main Spirit Guides off of that and especially since this life is potentially influencing past selves and life utilization at times. <br>- The kinds of things that were based off of this life especially outside of earth based. <br>- Those that are unable to work because of getting attacked and strong armed the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>- Those creating beginnings and Endings Monetaries in the systems that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There is a lot of manpower at times looking for things to do that my man Spirit Guides indicated. Recruitment that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>- Infiltration Checks that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>- Conglomerates and Round tables of Special pertaining to defense in regards to blame for events taking place especially pertaining to smalls and side characters. <br>- Document to transport those that my Main Camp indicated where my Main Camp indicated the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>- Entertainment deployments that my Main Camp indicated. <br>- I noticed something that change everything. The News speaking of other dimensional news and things of that nature. Which clashed especially upon some being forced in regards to the news to report nn certain events with aspects of my process in regards to those saying that somehow I deserve to attacked in regards to talking about other-dimensional matters, like big stuff, Gods and Spirit, Original Light and different kinds of direction. <br>- Other-dimensional selves and allpersonal not knowing how to proceed in certain moments, when in front of the scenes go with their proxies, authorities and main spirit guides in which some are trying to blame while partially for some putting them in shitty situations. <br>- (AJHD) Earth-Based was put into play earlier in which was already partially covered by way of (AJHD) Earth information online. Some of the lines tried heightened if I do information that is potentially outside of Earth-Based but it only pertains to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated anyhow. <br><br>Themes:<br>#UtilizationOfLife #ThoseExperiencingLife #Disparities #EnoughOfIt<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
