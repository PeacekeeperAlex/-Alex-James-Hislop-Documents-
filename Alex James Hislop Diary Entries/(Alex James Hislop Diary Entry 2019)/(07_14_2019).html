<div class="title">(07/14/2019)</div>
<div class="content">A certain kind being told that some of the events that happened were somehow just fiction and of course in the mix does include some fictitious events, the cover that some of the stuff happening is just certain spirits pretending to be Authority. The question remains though what is the truth. That line that the truth is destroying those seeking it is complete bullocks when the ignoring the truth has been doing a fair decent amount of damage happening. Does ignoring the pain  and suffering stop it from happening, there is probably some sort of literal mechanism in regards to making some of it a literal in which just adds to the confusion at times. Not to say that sort of system is bad because hey, at least some of the ignoring is doing decent. Let&#39;s be realistic though, if there is people getting attacked and ignoring it hasn&#39;t solved the problem then maybe understanding what&#39;s happening to us in certain ways like keeping tabs on current events might be decent. There are those that point towards the blatant that says they are tired of seeing the violence which should be a tell to a certain degree. When you start to notice all of the immorality taking place in regards to current events and that moment where you decide that yeah, we need to figure this shit out and that viewing all of this stuff is disheartening and literally causing pain to even view then one of the key understandings that some of it potentially is still taking place upon not watching it might be better than just outright accepting that isn&#39;t the case. This speaks of a certain kind in which might not necessarily be exclusive to the versions that some think it does. Those moral and enlightened higher up places to the sections of the light that can be considered brimstone and immoral. Different kind of heavens that have been at times used against some to think that heaven is more dark than previously imagined. So what then if a decent portion of what some thought were to be dark and violent events were rather not to be what some had thought them to be in ways in which some of the false thought to be something it wasn&#39;t still knocked on the door of what some considered to be too far. When the fictitious looks to be more real and equated to life in which you consider to be real upon events in which need to be understood. Varying degrees of reality when even the unreal aspects hold weight and those that don&#39;t view it that way hold power in which you thought never would be the case. Is it the case of moving upwards through areas in which certain Authorities need not let know of the things that happened or was just a wild glimpse of my imagination to let know of the horrors that existed below. When some not to consider a let know as vivid and real as that within my own imagination to be harm or suffering in which there might even be litigation in regards to whether that was my own imagination. The kind of thing that says that somehow certain spiritual mechanisms you were both with and got stolen and by the grace of God you got still have a certain kind at the very least so don&#39;t complain if some of those replacement spiritual mechanisms ever get stolen, lest you come into contact with the spirits that were looking for their stolen mechanisms which happened to be hooked up to you. Then again, moving upwards as so says partially the reasoning to why some want to be hiding certain events created an intrigue to stolen properties and mechanisms. We could get through it in an instant quick flash of time to speak of all of the quickened events around me at times and yet to still not have that to be said in regards to certain things regarding myself and others would be too difficult a prospect i suppose.  Even if we were to get through litigations at what point does it just look like a dealing with events lease upon which we keep dragging our feet. Waiting for the long dead carcass of whatever direction we decided to ditch to finally be ashes to dust to call it. What was worse anyhow the desire for this to be over during the dealing of those events or the lost time and ability to be able to deal with those events. As a Psychic, I can discern at times a quickening of motion around myself equated to events being moved quickly around myself. Do we just move to the future to wait until everybody get their only for some to claim that we skipped it anyhow to get a new lease on life?<br><br>- Lethargic and indecision today and there were aspects of some of my family members that I have discerned in regards to myself currently although potentially nothing to do with the indecision which actually at times has stemmed in regards to myself and the energies associated. Body energies of not knowing what I want to do in regards to recreational. Although i have discerned aspects of certain family most notably to do with gaming currently aas I have been trying to decide what to do. <br>- - Gaming interactions are really positive today or at least that&#39;s what I perceive  <br><br>#Twilight #Happiness #Imagination #War #GlobalMeetings #Spiritualist #Supers #ContentExperiences #Access #Story #Interaction #Neighborhood #Discretion #Intimacy #Gaming #Hollywood #Magnifiathans #Family<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
