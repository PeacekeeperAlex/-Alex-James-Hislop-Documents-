<div class="title">(06/12/2019) &quot;Sports hitting home&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- I was fairly productive this day, I manifested multiple kinds of Light via visualization access and other kind, a lot of different communications via spiritual mechanisms as well a changing up at key times. I utilized certain callwords while doing certain kinds of endeavours, hope, faith, blessings and belief. Different kinds of energy promotions throughout the day, love included. I also brought up key energies in certain areas around town which created a certain kind of splash and interaction from a far.<br><br>- I worked a bit on my websites adding expanded portions about love and archetypes as well as later on adding more to the Github Wiki specifically in regards to 2016. I had uploaded a certain document after the NHL game that I was watching, Game 7 of the Stanley Cup.<br><br>- I also did certain advocations before Watching NHL which I discerned while watching that big events spiritually were taking place in a certain manner. I watched the game and the kinds of interaction that has been happening as of late has really been that sort of forum discussion and bringing up different issues to talk about during key moments but throughout it all i can&#39;t help but shake and have seen interaction which still lends towards battle and turbulence taking place at times. One of topics had to do with physical interaction in regards to certain cities and the thought that there are certain conflicts arising by way of certain events having to do with copyright. <br><br>- One of the key things in regards to some of the events that I witnessed had to do with the emergence and reaching a new place, getting communications past a certain barrier as well as getting notice of a certain kind of God, I feel there were aspects to all three in which involved certain communication but I have been associating the communication and shaping of some physical in regards to certain kind pertaining to communication to be about certain physical human Culture, although I am now privy that it is not the only thing in regards to that sort of thing. Birds at times have been representative of communication and there are many humans that I have noticed shaped in regards to birds, some of which I feel does pertain to past life information but I also feel it is something that someone and groups are trying to let know of. <br><br>- Throughout the night I felt like I got attacked in a certain manner specifically in regards to my heart areas and other kinds in which seemed like it might be to facilitate someone to be able to walk though certain areas, we talk of being able to facilitate those that promote immorality and being able to bring them upwards through certain acts of immorality which can help in the long run but I fear what&#39;s lost is the kind of immorality that were talking about and the consent in regards, I hear it and do adhere to the systems that my Main Spirit Guides indicated but one of the difficulties that I just saw now was more darker than what is described it to be in regards to certain kinds of healing methods. <br><br>- Some of the banner games in regards to my process has ramped up and I think the point has been made to a certain degree in regards to the reputation and bring up of banners in a certain manner. My process changed from banners being brought up in a certain context to it being brought up damn well near always in my process currently. Again stemming and spanning from about a week ago. Another thing that is lost in the shuffle is that of dimensions and that in the mix of things that really is part of some of it but while i type this the thought that behind the scenes in the past 2 to 4 months that if banners have been brought p regularly in a certain context what does that mean for the current approach which is both obvious to not be of certain banners and also not so in certain regard.s What I have discerned in a certain context is that I have gained access to certain kinds of interaction by way of some of the experiences that have happened within my process. If war between two banners is declared in regards to my puzzle piece, a large portion of my process, I gain access to that War in which was already potentially taking place to a certain extent in other kinds of puzzle piece and multi-dimensional communities. So the idea is that by way of some of the events that happened in my process there has been access to certain areas not to say that wasn&#39;t privy before to some of those that could be considered a part of my puzzle piece but there is also certain updates that sometimes happen in regards to certain events happening, you will see a puzzle piece brought fourth into certain conflict and the conflict itself change. So multiple things, a) I have discerned certain rebellions at times in regards to certain culture and banners as well as others, b) I a defection I feel has happened or at least a smoke and mirrors one in a large way in which is either defected from certain banners and culture or is suppose to look that way, in a certain puzzle piece it might be that way and in others it might not necessarily be so. c) there were large update with past 8 days and potentially past month in regards to certain spiritual aspects of this physical planet earth and others as well where a group went in together in certain areas to try and clean certain things up in which it was half labelled to be of a certain kind of unfairly as I remember earlier process a part of it had to do with banners labelling certain acts to be of opposite banners, d) there is a rift changing in regards to the threshold in regards to certain dimensional existences where different iterations exist of certain kinds of banners and the struggle in regards to power pertaining is changing at times, e) in the mix at times has been the powerplay between gods and society in which there has been repair in regards to multiple perceptions pertaining in which sometimes is labelled a certain kind. f) another kind in which ahs bene in the mix is a certain dimensional in which sometimes interact with physical lives and other kind in which was disgruntles in certain kinds of ways and is said to have been given updates to satisfy although not all is as it seems g) partially because the spiritual updates fully haven&#39;t been rolled out across physical earth-based and others in which has been seen and understood in multiple contexts, although it much appreciated in many different kinds of ways. h) there were groups that were done and this groups that emerged to roll out updates in regards to multiple concepts although at the beginning of this journey were together on the onset, starts to change as the time rolls on, although something n that end has changed as well, and it&#39;s this idea that within certain banners and culture there is turmoil that exists to certain degree in which smaller conflict within are sometimes seen, within the context of ourselves it&#39;s been said that sometimes when we feel inner conflict that there might literally be spiritually battle between ourselves especially if we are combined with other souls in which make up a part of ourselves. the same could be said about different kinds of banners and cultures. Imagine that in certain spiritual culture, Canada goes to war with a nation for example but within the banner itself the provinces are also at times dealing with inner conflict a good metaphorical in physical earth based society would be equalization payments and the strife and disagreement that can cause at times for a province that is more well of to pay in regards to a province that is currently not doing as well, that could be considered an inner conflict but in regards to certain spiritual it might be more durastics like a certain province fighting with a city in such manners that would seem way more durastic than those equalization payment metaphors. I have discerned a portion of this physical earth based side with those groups that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and individuals that my main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to the Original Light and Original Dimensions that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There is a clear definition of what some would consider to be Original on this physical Planet Earth as well as elsewhere. <br>- (o·rig·i·nal<br>/əˈrijənl/<br> Learn to pronounce<br>adjective<br>1.<br>present or existing from the beginning; first or earliest.<br>&quot;the original owner of the house&quot;<br>synonyms:	indigenous, native, aboriginal; More)<br><br>The First Light in existences even if it was always there.
