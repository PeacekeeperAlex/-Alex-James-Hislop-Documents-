<div class="title">(04/15/2019) &quot;Keeping Tabs&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>This is one of those times where i need you to trust me and do what my Main Camp indicated. There are potentially those that are viewing my Diary Entries in multiple kinds of capacities, one of which could be in the physical by way certain Galactic Communities if not to keep tabs as well as other dimensionals taking stock. We need those that my Main Camp indicated in a certain place and area that my Main Camp indicated. Crooked teeth and psychic reveal, dreamland where I was in a dream I am worried that was one of the places affected in regards to my other dimensional selves, psychological defense and psychological offense advocationals and others(defined by my Main Camp) is needed. There is a person that should be defended and a certain groups that need a certain kind of healing as well as compensation the way my Main Camp indicated. Things are ok but there is a need for a certain defense not necessarily in regards to my Father Alan Hislop although there is peoples and beings continuing to try and insinuate the case to create that sort of thing happening but rather something in regards to them. Certain peripherals in regards to certain peoples on this physical planet earth may be targeted. Tethering of certain peoples by way of qualities sometimes twisted and traits as well as other kinds of machinisms. I woke up and felt my teeth have a grating feeling and I feel that it is a other dimensional medicine to try and invoke a certain kind of crazy. That sort where physicals and other dimensionals become or say they have become deluded and paranoid except that it doesn&#39;t work on myself and others(defined by my Main Camp) by way of knowledge and experience. Still, there was also other kinds of things happen in which I haven&#39;t fully lamented upon here that some may consider minor in which I am worried is not minor at all. I am letting know if it in certain forms and it is physical and not so in certain ways but if it happens again I will let know of it in a larger fashion potentially on here. Today has been utilization of what I would call the quickening OCD-like zippy do-da kind of energies in regards to quick movement and feels like certain filters. There was an argumentative that was reminiscent of earlier process. There was a large scenes in regards to certain kinds of activity in regards to a meeting that was happening partially said to be because of some of the documents that I put into play and advocationals that I put into play. It was said to have been a past event that i was reliving something that had already been setup before I had this life, something that had already happened in a certain manner in which there was more clashes and turbulence pertaining to meet point. There was a moment where I thro up certain information as to partly being one of the physicals in the room and the unfairness and absurdities of some of what has happened partly said to be because of my actions. They say I am partly the trap and that to attack me is the trap but I am actually thinking that I am the bait. ripple onwards in which by way of writing this ripples it further to the trap. Timelines and time was ever present yesterday and what some might equate to dimensional existences and certain kinds of time rooms in which exist within certain dimensional thresholds. Potentially trying to shoehorn me in what some feel would be the future as well as information regarding certain peoples. By the end of the night it was quite surreal the amount of spiritual interaction around myself.
