<div class="title">(12/29/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>I have noted impression in regards to certain people. Sometimes some will have white impressions of skin and the colour of hair being an indicator of aspect within processes. There is certain spirit that have utilized a persons impressions in certain manners in which shapes a process. Someone has white skin, it&#39;s sometimes utilized in a banner perspective. There is those kinds where a mock banner is created for use in which is viewed in many different fashions. Even the term mock banner can be offensive to some but it really does let know of the kind of utilization I am trying to relay. Some of these kinds of banners that emerge would be viewed more than how they did upon inception and some of them are already viewed in capacities in which is similar to how some view clubs and factions as well as nations. You can have green eyes and you never know if you are associated with a that colour in a concept fashion even more than what some would consider a banner. Interaction systems behind the scenes and dimensional deployment where there are spiritual entities in which utilize the colour of a certain aspect of someone in which they can change form, clothing, style, behavior and personality as well as other kinds to facilitate something as seemingly simple as the colour of a characteristic that we present within our live dimensional. What needs to be understood is that some of these shapings would move away at times from what we would want them to be and instead be utilized and facilitated in regards to how certain other-dimensional would want them to be. In understanding why that is the case you would need to understand some of the culture and experiences of some of the spiritual that would exist around some of us. The structure of incarnation should be noted and the fact that we for some of us at times have conflict within ourselves can lend towards the fact that some of us never agreed to certain aspects of certain incarnation. Maybe we wanted to have different colored eyes in which in the mix there is a natural variable and certain spirits facilitating random manifestation partially by way of our the power of our own perception but also a portion of the nature of this dimensional. It creates a wonderful tapestry of shaping upon ourselves in which is sometimes infused by our own choosings as well as the choosings of others and that elements of random. How one views these aspects of self matters greatly and doesn&#39;t have to matter for some. The eyes are the windows of the soul but they are also shaped by certain spirit in regards to genes and other kinds of shaping throughout life. Aspects of self changing in a live dimensional and bodily sort of way in which is spiritual in nature too. There are also potentially more to oneself than just the sense of visual and even the visual of something could be much more than what seems. For example their might be entire dimensions in regards to the eyes of a person. One strand of hair could be a tree in another dimension. You could be experiencing aspects of allpersonal from your organs and our entire body could be an organ in other dimensional in which is for some not always the same. The physical humans on this planet can observe difference in Culture, Race, Nationality, Gender and a wide other different kinds of characteristics in which is emphasized as well in other dimensional. Concepts similar and dissimilar to Gender in which we don&#39;t fully know about it. Think of another kinds of behavior archetype in which is associated to having certain kind of mechanisms in which can be a part of identity in regards to ourselves spiritually but doesn&#39;t have to be for some of it. It&#39;s interesting that we have arrived to the point that some of what I am trying to describe doesn&#39;t have to be a part of our identity in which some might ask why exactly is that? The point that some of us have been shaped and altered in certain manners in which we would dislike reminds of features regarding ourselves in the lives in which we might dislike in regards to ourselves. It&#39;s this point that some might be wary of and I don&#39;t blame certain kind but I feel it&#39;s a valid discussion. They have talked to a certain extent in how some of us have been handicapped in certain dimensional existences and a lot of which has been lumped onto to the idea of banners. I think what needs to be understood for physical earth-based is how a great portion of the physicals proceed in regards to what they consider to be their own banners and how they view those aspects of self and the shaping in regards to themselves. It truly gets to another point in which speaks of how ones operate and ethical within the confines of culture and society as well as others. There is also ways of life to a certain degree in regards to how one operates which due to the time has traversed passed ethical boundaries in certain dimensional. These aspects of self and the utilization in regards to them should be further understood though. When you are incarnate at what point do you not adhere to some of the systems of operating when you are located in certain places. If you live in an area in which is fairly violent, putting defensives seems to be the normal thing to do. If some of us are overlapping spiritual culture at times in which is violent sometimes and the larger portion of our spiritual interaction happens to be goodness and enlightenment than the normal thing to ask at times would be why we are experiencing certain interaction in which is turbulent or violent in nature spiritually. When we bring up the point that some of the use of the qualities in regards to ourselves has been in ways in which <br><br>One of the talking points has been gaming as of late. It&#39;s interesting to note that we could have aspects of ourselves in which are located in certain spiritual gaming systems at times in which is a part of our selves. I have talked about how we are at times in interaction with other dimensional existences while we live our lives in what we are seemingly experiencing in the live. We go about our lives but the fact that we could be living different life behind the scenes and even in front of the scenes remains to be a portability in regards to my own experiences and the correlation of other experiences. A greater portion of these dimensional existences are moral and for some reason or another at times a portion of the interaction has not always reflected that in certain manners while still being protected a large portion of the time. <br><br>Themes: #Gaming #Traps #Stuck #Fixes #Deployment #Allpersonal #OtherDimensional #Spirituality #Religion<br><br>Medical Observation: <br>Two days previous they said to have attacked my eyes, i felt a layer on my physical eyes and the dimensional regarding move outwards from my eyes and turned into swirling floating dimensional overlaps.<br><br>letting know there are teams that my Main Spirit Guides indicated around me in which facilitate at times certain things that are brought up or brought tot the attention of myself. <br><br>Certain kind safeguarding the bad spirit of good from going over the edge, especially in regards to going bad past that point.<br>The ones that take the hit upon changing subjects as well as those that take the hit in regards to reasonings why actions happen.<br>Those that have been antagonizing spirits to work against me and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.</div>
