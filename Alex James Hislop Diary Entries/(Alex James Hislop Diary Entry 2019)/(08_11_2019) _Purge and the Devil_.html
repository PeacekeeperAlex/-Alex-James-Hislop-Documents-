<div class="title">(08/11/2019) &quot;Purge and the Devil&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>Yesterday it kind of felt like a certain kind of event happened upon me watching Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995) and I had advocated for the Movie Stars that my Main Spirit Guides indicated to watch Die Hard: with a Vengeance as well as Hellboy days before. There was movement in regards to a certain kind making their presence be known and I couldn&#39;t discern fully if it was bad guys or good guys, I kind of feel like there was multiple groups, some in which good and some in which bad. There was something personal about this film but it was from an observing perspective. It was one of my favorite films growing and I discerned a classic to the film in the mix in certain regards in which I am hoping for safety. I discerned a Hollywood presence to this film in which some are saying might have had t do with certain battles and conflict as well as mediation and diplomacy that has taken place in regards to hollywood. Some of this is impression work and things being shoehorned in certain areas to make something seem a certain way but some of this stuff that I am experiencing really does seem to be happening at times. Earlier there was this presence of Off world in which traversed and tried to help situations in regards to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There was a moment talked about evolution and creation especially in regards to the big bang in which I discerned certain famous to have been affected in a certain manor. Cop impression to be true in regards to some of the shows I was potentially watching. Multiple conflicts taking place in certain manners in which I have been aware of.<br><br>A certain kind of interaction that reminded me of the 100 from process earlier past. Happened during an episode of Nausea and spins in regards to my mother after taking a certain THC Gummy. I saw her turn into someone that didn&#39;t classically remind me of her and it scared me to be honest. Mumbling things about being scared and she looked really out of it. At one point someone thought to call the ambulance. I kind of felt it was a bit of a purge to be honest and certain toxins and negative energy leaving her. I am wondering what her allpersonal was like because I kind of felt that some were hallucinating as well as certain aspects of herself saying that she felt crazy as well as a silent migraine. I felt that certain kind went away today in regards to her as well as a certain kind of spiritual rehabilitation happened. I felt the presence of Christianity as well as other aspects too. Good spirits I feel situating process but there is something off and maybe some it to feel that way. I called upon angels and did multiple kinds of machinisms in which I felt my process change and move towards a different area. For some potentially a certain kinds of safehouse but for others maybe a certain kind of staging area. I did multiple thing in regards to the AJH Earth Doing Callwords to try and help situation, multiple kinds of advocations and information in regards to out loud channeling and Korin Speech and mind voice. <br><br>Advocationals:<br>Alex James Hislop process frameworks specific to those in warfare and peace.<br><br>Defense: <br>Idea:<br>- Alex-Online (The idea that old ones that exist have existed for long enough to create their own Online)<br>- 20 to 200 Grouping names, some of which overlap each other. The idea was to look at some of the reasonings as to why creation of documentation and information as well as uploading was more difficult to create multiple times in a certain context and some of the answer remains to be work amount, so the idea of working together to achieve work load and creating group names in which can then create workloads in the context of different kinds of variables, (1) Personal, (2) Allpersonal, (3) Family, (4) Friends, (5) Proximities, (6) Operations, and there are other ones but you take those variables and you apply your process mechanics in regards to it, so for example in regards to myself, It&#39;s been pro-camp and anti-camp as well as neutral and MainCamp/Main Spirit Guides to a certain degree, so I look at those variables and there is four, I times those previous six points by 4 and label it clearly. Remember each of those six labelled points can also contain multiple other points in which upon applying a certain subject in regards to document creation and information creation can stack up a lot of different documents. Example, I want to create an (AJHD) Family Document in which applying different kinds of methods and creating extra document can lend towards cohesion and help in the long run. (AJHD) (Personal) Family, (AJHD) (Allpersonal) Family, (AJHD) (Family) Family, (AJHD) (Friends) Family, (AJHD) (Proximities) Family, (AJHD) (Operations) Family. You can apply further variables which increases the work load and for some they can feel put off in regards to going that direction but upon working in teams and groupings can create chemistry and work ethic as well as less overall effort if working as a team depending on the circumstances and variables. Creating ten to twenty soul names as well in regards to yourselves can be beneficial as well. Let&#39;s say 100 spirits in one group. Each spirit creates 10 - 20 soul names each, heck if some of you know your other soul names that can lend towards it. The idea for one of your soul names is the smallest you would ever become and the idea for another might be the biggest you would ever as per God Spark combining. So if you have an incline of ever combining as well as others with the biggest ones in the sky, then potentially coming up with a name in which you would call yourself in regards to that entity upon combining and others in which you might already have a name that you can equate later on after leaving certain places. Less Competition, more Comfort laid back atmospherics I would recommend but there are many different types of ways of doing it. Areas to be able to do with not just dimensional but also housing. Like having multiple rooms to invoke creativity, Art and Cinema, Music and Wonder. Different rooms for different group members and ways to be able to facilitate that work load getting finished in which can lend to better output than if some were to do it on their own. For example in regards to myself as one of the only physicals in the room on my end, I feel that doing certain tasks in creating all of these documents to be daunting but if I had multiple other people helping me, even with added  documents to create, I wouldn&#39;t feel it to be as daunting anymore. <br>Explanation of non labelled documents like without Personal Tag and what it entails.  <br>Personal, Main Proxies, Authorities, Pro-Camp, Anti-Camp, Family, Friends, Neutral, Proximity, Knowledge of Specifics(IE: Earth for myself)<br>(Earth<br>Earth Based Humanity<br>Earth Based Animals<br>Earth Based Insects)<br> How can single unites and lone wolves have a productivity that&#39;s even better? Carry on the Conversation. If everybody wrote this kind of stuff down with advocations in regards to certain systems it can be of benefit. Just writing this down in the physical potentially helped. I and others that my main Spirit Guides are advocating for what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to the Systems that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. Light; Do what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to these advocations the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
