<div class="title">(07/18/2019) &quot;The Lion King&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>- I decided to go to Newmarket and catch a film, The Lion King (2019). I took a couple buses to get their and a couple back going to the Silver City Theatre in New Market.<br>- There was multiple things happening this day in which was besides the Movie themes and doing advocationals in regards to film I went to see. Sometimes watching films that just release have a present day and current events that can change a process in regards to certain kinds of viewing.<br>- One of the themes this day was both the smoke and mirrors of some of the harm and attack within my process  and others as well as the smoke and mirrors of everything being decent. It&#39;s been a mixed bag I feel, not as bad some have said and not as decent. Upon travelling at times I have noticed energy situating and energies upon airplanes and greyhounds being a certain kind. I thank  those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to the Transportation areas and energy situating in regards to Earth and others. It&#39;s not the full tell though as to what the heck is going on at times and if there is big events as depicted happening and trying to be taken place as well as future utilization of some of the depictions within my process and other considering how large at times it can seem and realistic, we need to understand this and those that enter my process should have certain understanding as well that I have pointed out that there has been smoke and mirrors in regards to tells and mentions of harm and attack and that I am aware that some of it might not be what some are saying. Same goes to some of it potentially if it has been taking place. <br>- It speaks of some of the atrocities that are happening below to a certain degree and the let know of what some in certain areas are going through. A let know of some located in certain dimensional existences but also potentially more than that.<br>- Utilization of moments to then try and attack at times was discerned, like a bus ride that&#39;s fancy sadi to have been a part of the madness I am creating in morality and quality of life in which might not be a strong enough symbolism if there is large things taking place partially masked in regards to mine and others actions but rather events also taking place in which potentially affected by our actions.  <br>- The understanding of the defense that has been happening being let known as well as some of the attacks that have tried to have happen even during certain present events potentially this day. <br>- A certain moment revealed where I realized that there is literal present trying to proceed in figuring this stuff out. I have been walking around at times feeling like there has been a large amount of smoke and mirrors as well as red tape and a subtle under the radar ignorance in regard to some of the present partially by way of process circumstance and being shoehorned off to the side at times although potentially looking like not so in regards to some of the present discussions but either way a perception and feeling that there has been just this lack of proceeding in a certain manner when there is a present working out certain kinds of stuff to be able to situate, not just mediation and diplomacy but literally moving through certain kinds of direction in which is impacting certain events. A moment where I realized that potentially by lending resources towards certain present events that we can hit home and lend towards something in which can help proceedings. <br>- At the same times I see a quickening happening around myself and moving past certain time frames potentially in the past and present in extreme ways. At times my impact being extreme as well too <br>- Ripple affect talked about this day and although I did feel like some were trying to potentially utilize small tells in a certain manner, I feel there was also some letting know of something in regards to RIpple Affect. <br>- There was multiple kinds of updates this day and different kinds of energies. A certain moment they brought up reminded me of the greyhound bus ride when I was sad in which ahs been utilized against certain people at times but I am allowed to feel sad and it wasn&#39;t necessarily because of some of bad things that would happen although it might be a part of it. I just missed someone that&#39;s all. <br>- I felt many different kinds of energies in regard to The Lion King (2019). Cave impression stopping conversation point similar to a conversation frame in regard to Alita Battle Angel. Leaders discussing certain kinds of things. There was also certain characters seen within the film itself throughout, some of which lamented upon different kinds of villains to a certain degree. There was a moment where it looked like some of the Characters on screen were more representative to entire armies but It was done in a way in which some were surprised and elated in regards to Technological updates but I am also wondering what it was about in a certain manner. The Character of Scar was let known to have been a certain kind both fighting a battle in regards to himself, a good spirit put in a situation of disparity while fighting multiple kinds of villains. One of the storylines in regards to the film was that Mufasa might have been a bad guy but I feel ultimately that it was shades of Grey, that there were aspects of Mufasa that were both good and bad and aspects of Scar that were both good and bad. The film was near verbatim to the kind of scenes in regards to the 1994 film but more serious at times and almost more akin the feelings I got from the Title revealing of the original Animated film. <br><br>Themes:<br>#Pride #Sons #Fathers #Animals #Communication #Transportation #Story #Travel #Direction #Characters #Comedy #Guideship #Friendship #Royalty #Events #Present #CinemaTimeDiscussions #Newmarket #Time #Lions #Hyenas #Live<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
