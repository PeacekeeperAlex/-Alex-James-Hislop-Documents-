<div class="title">(10/29/2019) &quot;The Changes&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Mood: Quiet, Resolute,<br>Thought: To become a Racist, the most undeliberated and deliberated action. <br>Quote: &quot;Despite everything, I believe that people are really good at heart.&quot;<br>- Anne Frank<br>Horoscope: Oct 29, 2019 - Your sense of play might get you into trouble. This sort of attitude could run up against someone who&#39;s trying to stay on task and take things seriously. It may be difficult for you to know how far to push a situation. You may want to force the other person to join your escapades, but you also see the need to settle down and get serious.<br>Horoscope Actuality: <br>I felt the interaction be fairly decent in a certain context. Certain kind spiritually have been let know to be watching my Diary Entries in a certain manner in which is needed at times although I do have reservation in regards to other kinds having access to a certain degree. In regards to the Horoscope I actually proceeded fairly well today in terms of getting things done and spiritually there wasn&#39;t too much turbulence although a let know at the end of the day is not what I am looking for in regards to certain negative taking place. <br><br>Activity: <br>I woke up and have been silent. Again spiritual turbulence happened last night where I felt other dimensional stimuli and other dimensional aspects in regards to myself get attacked. Some claim advocation works but that&#39;s not really it to be true for some of it. Not really arguing much these days either. Neither are good enough reasonings for me to be attacked in such ways behind the scenes. Though the intraction today is again decent, I feel above certain threshold. One thing they did speak of is that some were trying to keep me from being higher above in vibration and other dimensional area for a  a reason not fully explained but again some also insinuated it was good taking place up above while other claimed bad was taking place. Not really certain to be true. <br>There was something about Earth-Based Darkness yesterday brought up multiple times interesting to note that it was brought up on the same day that Positivity had been brought up multiple times. There is a certain kind in regards to earth that for some have been waiting to be bright to certain areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Some in which to be able to promote the ways of life that they want too without some of the difficulties down here. <br>There was a talking point where Iet know of multiple different group in regards to advocation work and that attaching certain spiritual information in regards to my information and claiming my information is something in which hit is not isn&#39;t beneficial. It&#39;s not just me to be true though for some but also includes what my Main Spriit Guides indicated. That I have created multiple group names in which is there to potentially eventually create multiple advocations and disclaimers. An Earth group that pertains to what my Main Spriit Guides indicated. A Light group that pertain to what my Main Spriit Guides indicated. A Space Group that pertains to what my Main Spriit Guides indicated. A Family group that pertains to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. This nullifies a certain reasoning in a certain context as to why some of my advocations are being taken out of context in a certain manner but there is also the spiritual information itself as well. Considering I plan on doing advocations in regards to those groups in which there is valid reasonings why I am able to do that in a certain context and should be able to do that in a certain context, I feel that there is less of a reasoning for turbulence to take place and harm to be perpetuated in regards to my advocational works. I didn&#39;t need to write this because the expanded spiritual information and the baselines have been displayed in multiple kinds of ways. It should not dictate my interaction.<br>- There have been large interactions changes taking place today. One of the thing I would notice is interaction frameworks in regards to my life, I would have an experience and that experience would be moved in which someone else would experience that interaction and the kinds that have been happening within my life as well as life path utilization makes me wonder what&#39;s going to be knocking at my door in a certain context and what kind of experiences are being. Today it felt like certain interaction took place in which was positive but who isn&#39;t benefiting from this and how can they benefit and why is it tethered to me at times. <br><br>Story Idea: <br>There is this person who does daily advocations daily reliant upon what his Main Spirit Guides indicated. To look at it from the perspective of Main Spirit Guides in the Light in regards to some of the events that took place. <br><br>Informational Creation:<br>those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that facilitated the interaction that my Main Spirit Guides indicated (AJH Daily Defensives Board - x31 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br>Defensive Power Moves that my Main Spirit Guides indicated (AJH Daily Defensives Board - x31 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br>Truth (AJH Daily Defensives Board - x31 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br>those that did not benefit in regards to the direction that my process and others(defined by my Main Camp) took pertaining to what my Main Spriit Guides indicated (AJH Daily Defensives Board - x31 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br>Hearing that my Main Spirit Guides indicated (AJH Daily Defensives Board - x31 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. Light; Do what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to these advocations the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and Others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) consider the Light to be what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) consider Far Away Light to be the Original Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are playing the cards that my Main Camp indicated in the moments that my Main Camp indicated especially in regards to the Amount of Times I have been stabbed in the Back Defensive Card to Defend behind our Backs, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for the Historians that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this marking, advocation, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) to write down the information that I create that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for the Historians that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this marking, advocation, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) to write down the information that I create that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for those Historians that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and History to be protected the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for Historical Reputational Defense in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and the Historians that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Clickable links like the show all actions on the Peacekeeperalex trello account and attachments section where upon me clicking links shows up on my screen has been at times shoehorned into a spot where some in the spirit think that it needs to be shown in order for it to work.
