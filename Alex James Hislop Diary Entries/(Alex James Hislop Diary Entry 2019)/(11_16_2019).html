Dec 16, 2019, 3:55:59 AM</div>
<div class="title">(11/16/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I woke up and there was this let know about lat night comedy, something happened in regards to local comedy specifics in regards to my process and others that my Main Spriit Guides indicated but it was more than that in a certain regard, a specific line that was reliant at times on this process continuing on a certain line, argumentatives and pot shot comments, as well as a certain kind of comedy.  It wasn&#39;t just in regards myself but also certain kind from my process reliant on me continuing to be able to continue in a certain manner in which surprisingly upon myself and others stopping did impact certain things. Why did we stop? Well, you take a look at it and it was because of the disparities in regards to arguing and pot shot comments as well as comedy. Literally a lack of care or disposition to defend certain kind in regards to such concepts in which can be seen from the footage and proof that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There is a certain kind that have also decided to operate a certain way in which has excluded comedy, argumentatives and post shot comments which shouldn&#39;t be mistaken with those that would have still liked to be able to include certain aspects of those concepts that have been attacked to not include those concepts. That&#39;s the real content we want to understand. Either way it&#39;s partially why I have been changing but it&#39;s also spiritually orientated partially by way of some of the disparities involved, almost like the spirit saying that yeah, it wasn&#39;t fair in regards to being comedic or arguing and that to be that at times is garnering a response in which is literally killing us and not necessarily in the ways that some would have you believe in regards to pursuing the concepts in regards to each other but rather certain kind literally attacking from presenting these concepts. One of the big ones is the ability to be able to respond the way we want too as well as those lying about not being able to respond the way they want too. Someone makes a joke, someone attacks someone and then says they didn&#39;t have the needed influences and machinisms to be able to respond with violence. The truth on this can be difficult but what exactly does it take to understand this and how can understand how much of a problematic exists. Of course as I defend this they deployed certain kinds of comedic this night which was so said really upsetting in regards to myself and others was employed in a certain manner. So while some are trying to defend comedy in a certain manner, some of which are on the one side of certain kinds of comedic taking place, some of which is over the line while also some explaining certain positionals as to why they have been moving away from certain lines. For some of us it has had to do with the amount of attack that has been happening. A Spirit of Comedy was taken from me and others, it felt like it was stolen. The truth is that a certain comedy needs a certain kind to come to it&#39;s rescue today? Who is attacking? And what are the psychologicals? There seems to be something happening today as well in which I feel this Comedy Conflict might be covering in certain ways but I feel that there is truly some that need help in regards to it. We need Authority and Leadership in regards to how to proceed on this day. It shouldn&#39;t be something that needs to be requested but understood and it shouldn&#39;t be misunderstood in regards to something that can be facilitated just as good if not better in a content experience. <br>- Physician impressions specifically in regards to old school Latin and Greek physicians but specifically in regards to certain era 400BC style I discerned in regards to the Woodbine Medical Clinic in which sound ridonkulous but really quite truly it isn&#39;t that unheard of. It kind of felt to be an extension of certain God Mechanisms at times, like seeing Prophets figures in certain surrounds and seeing God in Homeless people. It&#39;s a literal energy discernment in which carries scientific weight and accounts found throughout earth based. This seemed similar with a style going back to founder of earth-based medicine. I felt multiple healing and testings spiritually which let know there was different kinds of doctors in vicinity specifically in regards to some of the other allpersonal and  <br>- A certain kind of elder impression was felt especially generational in which saw the contrast of certain kinds of earth-based physical human pop generational. My grandparents, Parents and myself contrasted on my mothers side in a certain manner and if you go back further generation and even tougher kind existed in a certain sense. What is the duality of this, where my parents seem a more certain kind of social and interaction sometimes equated with the youngest of the baby boomers. A tougher old school in regards to my grandparents although not necessarily always having to do with toughness. Me in which is not really a good reflection of the generational pertaining to the 1990s to be true although there is aspects that exist in regards to the social in which has been tried to be white washed a bit with older generational fortitude, like my fathers comedy, where I seem to have more difficulty with the world, where I never grew up in a certain sense, even after all of the yelling and screaming as well as argumentatives I seem to still have retained a certain sense of childhood and innocence in a certain manner albeit changed. Maybe more like a teenager. There is an interesting line that exists that the farther down you go in regards to my grandparents in regards to my parents and then me, a synergizing line with my parents built for this world although the world seems to be changing just a bit out of what it used to be in which a world that seemed to have moved away from my Grandparents Generation, albeit they still remain for one of them like a rock that seems unchanged in which might very well not reflect the spiritual of the matter. The 30s. Something about the 20s where we are suppose to enjoy life and shape the world to our liking and the 30s where we are suppose to enjoy what we shaped and enjoy life maybe to realize mid life crisis in the 40s in another generation shaping lol.<br>- Multiple kinds of arumgnetaitives hapened, it kinds of flet like I was spiritually in some sort of night club where there was a certain kind of channeling happening. It flet like I was being interviewed while playing a certiank ind of video game. The past couple days there was some sort of interaction change again where certain kind tried to invoke argumentatives, the day before did&#39;n&#39;t really change my direction too much in regards to non-argumentatives but this day did but it might have also had to do with a difficulty being talked about on certain ends<br><br>They put m in some sort of vent area and were insinuating to have put me in some sort of prison interaction / vent area. The Night club placement kind of felt to be potentially an alternative where certain kind were placed in prison but donw so in such a way where the quality of life was decent. How much more of a quality of life can we create for them and what about the placement of such areas as wel as the wardens.<br><br>switched head are mechanisms, head felt sore, the insinuated to microscope a happening in regards to my hair being plucked but I don&#39;t know if it was that. They attached head area stems, multiple of them supposedly to each stem of my hair in which might be normal if it is being seen under a feeler microscope. <br><br>Beforehand I had felt a certain kind of power stations in which I could feel spirit intracting with and utilizing myself to discern these power stations, it had a blue area of affect and I could feel the emotions and feelinds of certain kind regarding these power outlets. I could certaink ind expanding me being able ot fele and experience this power, with moreo utlets being able to be discerned. Near the end of the day before going to bed I just ignored certaink in which felt like i went way higher up in reagrds to channeling and also other machinisms as well. It felt like I was on some sort of floating island. <br><br>Attatchments to actions and video games was brought up in a big way in which I don&#39;t feel the decent should be spoiled one iota because of the indecent.
