<div class="title">(11/28/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>I noted a spirit of water yesterday. It was a moment where I saw the spirit of Water through story receive something in which I felt was something the needed to happen not only within this process but potentially on this planet. If there is spiritual in regards to droplets of water and other kinds then what would the question of quality of life be on this Earth-Based. What exactly is it suppose to be.There have been themes in this process this past week in which some might call elemental. Air, Earth and Water in which some could even look towards light and other kinds to equate that Fire too has been around as of late. There has been an understanding, knowing and discernment of spirit in regards to the elements but some of the big ones I have noted are some of the ones in which we listed on this physical at times. What we create in writings sometimes has an impact in which the spiritual embellish and let know of the truth regarding. In the context of elemental it&#39;s not the only elements, science would agree but some within certain worlds might disagree. Even so you look towards to space in which can be considered that fifth elemental. I feel these all have an elemental spirit, some in which might be local that can be a part of the greater concept. There is also spirit in regards to some of the literals though. Spirit of Earth to be true and there might be aspects of earth in which speaks of those four elemental immortalized through our writings and existence. When I speak of humanity there was a legend about an exchange in regards to the spirit of water. Granted to be able to utilize water for survival there something given. The literal in regards to some of this on an evolution scale might have been conversations and bartering between shapers of Humanity and that of Water. The truth is that it is probably more than that upon the shaping of some of the Mammals and I would note that there is teams of spirit behind the scenes in regards to the science of evolution upon this planet. It sometimes speaks of something that exists between this world and the universe in which we inhabit.<br>The Spirit of Water discerned in the picture utilized within one of my Board on the Peacekeeperalex reminded of the above paragraph in a certain sense. We talk of story existences and the themes that one can relate within the art work that exists. Upon the subject interestingly enough beforehand I would sense a Spirit of the Light. One that might have to do with realism culture but is also of light culture. A light discerned, different than the one days previous in which when I utilized thought impression within the phrase passing on, white light energies with hints of blue manifested. Medical, Realism and sometimes seen within NDE Culture especially in regards to Hospitals. What took place upon a vindication that would cause such a light to appear? This was upon me creating boards of informational placement where I had the right of way to create such information for what&#39;s acceptable. It would turn into something different in interaction upon how I proceeded with my process. A Moment where I would feel this light change things behind the scenes spiritually, discerned as a psychic medium, spiritualism culture around, one of the big ones. It got partially shaped upon the kinds of interaction and actions taking place in my process in which again I must stress I wish was not shaping the interaction pertaining to my process as much as it does. The Light moved things, enveloped and healed me and healed others. I could feel spiritual healing taking place. I could feel spirit within vicinity realize that what was happening around me was rally taking place in almost an unbelievable sort of way in which did not stop it. It continued to manifest and open around me in which my spiritual eyes could see and the psychictivity relayed that there a certain kind of Light opening. A dimensional existence that was shinning upon vicinity. I realized I love this process again and wondered where along the way that I seemed to start to dislike this process. It didn&#39;t take long to remember the morning of yesterday in which the fact that I was remembering was good sign nonetheless. It seemed to be speaking that I hit a marker spiritually. That somehow it was around me for a reason. Was it a moment upon a listening to Hillsong Worship, let their be light, creating a Reddit post of the same name utilized in song, Listening to some old school Rock and Roll and flipping to a blues station on youtube that created such a unique interaction of last night? Of course all the while some battling it out behind the scenes in regards to certain spiritual events taking place. One of the things I remember asking the light is if we can take those spirit that are located below with us to the good places. I felt love, acceptance and enlightenment upon me, I felt innocence and purity of soul. The masks of the world that were mine off of me somehow, safeguarded hopefully. I still want to play violent video games, I am still of that culture but I couldn&#39;t deny that I too am of the spiritualist culture of Goodness as well. It was interesting that it happened after a certain kind of was trying to invoke a response of hatred to label another culture the bad guys in sowing discord and upsetness within another culture. <br>I have been doing informational placement, online in this physical digital earth-based in which has been helping at times but some feel it&#39;s not fully necessary by way of spiritual information already being in play. It still is a decent achievement on my end I feel because having that information created on physical earth-base,d disclaimers, testification and advocations written in a certain way in which has helped behind the scenes and in front of the scenes. The question of worth comes up to a certain degree, myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated ask if it was worth the turmoil behind the scenes. There are a large proton that want to say no in a certain context. Am I suppose to let know of some of the spiritual insinuation that there have been millions of spirits that have died in some of our defense. In regards to some of our lives. That there has been defensives not only in higher light in which would and can seem to be quite dominant some in which without casualties, but also within middles realms and lower existences as well. When you look towards some of the let knows in regards to some of my informational placements, it might look absurd, crazy and even outlandish. I show a physical on this physical planet Earth what I have done in regards to creating disclaimers in regards to physical planet Earth, some might say so what and others might might say that it is a decent. There would be those that would say that the gravity of such actions are not fully understood but others might say it&#39;s more understood by way of the response compared. <br>For some in the lens that has been at times within this process in regards to certain spirit of the spirit in interaction, certain kinds of culture and certain kinds of spirit maybe working against some of that culture this response might be nowhere nears that. It might be more similar to the stats we sometimes see within WWII. It&#39;s a stat that regular folk would look at and balk at, would consider be fictitious, would shake their fists upon finding out the truth of such a statistic at the sheer absurdity that that is how many spirit are perishing within a process especially if earth-based disclaimers to be blamed. A normality and reasoning taken for a truth and safety. How their can be such turbulence over such actions and then blamed to be those that would create such information when a look is suppose to be and is not. Both point towards ways of life affected.
