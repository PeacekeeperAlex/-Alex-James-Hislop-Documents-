<div class="content">Mood: Quiet, Reflective, Mentality, Psyche.<br>Thought: The Staple to keep us together and remind of the pain it could have been and should not be.<br>Quote: “To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.”<br>― Oscar Wilde<br>Horoscope: <br>Horoscope Actuality: Quiet sort of day after the events of yesterday, I cleaned my room and I kind of felt like there was a moment where some other dimensional scars happened. Spiritually they try they try to get me feel that there is sometimes some negative taking place but in this context I feel there might have been running to the attic. A procession of certain spirits leaving my bedroom upon sweeping shouldn&#39;t be but I felt the stimuli i multiple forms after I had cleaned.People probably on&#39;t have to worry about metaphoricals in regards to not cleaning but it&#39;s something to note. I am not certain what exactly has taken place in some of the processes in regards to myself but I feel that mine has taken a certain kind of turn and that anti-camp styles are a bit out of the window or at least have something to do in the meantime. <br><br>Activity:<br>I have seemed to become aware that some are trying to make me something different in the dimensional bestowing certain kind of logic to partially excuse certain actions but to also frighten other in regards to earth-based pertaining to helping me, this is one of the lenses but some say that amount of turbulence within this process warrants it being worth more which again we have seen these lines employed i&#39;m multiple fashion in which at the end of the day looks to be not necessarily as beneficial as some say as well as not as genuine as some think. <br><br>I was attacked in the middle of the night upon waking up in a certain moment. It looked like spirits really were attacking me behind the scenes but there is also the other kind of attack  been happening as well. How I am i suppose to be positivity if this interaction continues to take place and throughout it all i have continued to be positive, loving daily for hours a day as well as changing mindset yesterday to name a few, one of which had to do with thinking that some our out to get me and switching it to reflect that there is a lot of spirit trying to help me. Massive amount of energies and other kinds placed on me at times in which speaks of gum deterioration but large amount in the Head Area and chest area as well as other kinds. I feel that some of it I am not able to feel might be actually still damaging me to a lesser degree compared to the stimuli I can feel, Like a registry upon me feeling it causing more damage potentially. After I got attacked I felt certain stimuli which still felt like some attacking me, it felt like the higher spirit that I can some times feel when walking down the street, like me moving into higher infrastructure and fully sensing more so what this higher spirit is doing not only behind the scenes but in the physical, rather though there is one for the house area that I can feel upon leaving my room at times. When I woke up after getting attacked it felt like this spirit latched onto to me and was disoriented. I think some were trying to claim that I was drunk behind the scenes or something of that nature. <br><br>They also maneuvered certain kinds of driving direction partially from it being understood that some of thee interaction I have experienced in early life in which denotes what exactly is some of this driving stuff about if I experienced some of it earlier, i am not necessarily calling it out for what s acceptable and if I am what is the reasoning. A certain kind felt done in this process but for some of them it&#39;s not true. I continued to be put in higher places near the end of the day, I will feel more physical like stimuli and dimensional frameworks I am able to feel as a psychic shrinked down. <br><br>Some claim that somehow I am creating this by way of writing down my experiences but that is hogwash for a portion. Especially considering the amount of positivity invoked in this process at times. Even with the Argumentatives ceasing in this process it should be be the difference between being placed in a dangerous area. The amount of augmentation in regards to Natural Ripple Affect and emphasis in regards to subject changing and interaction changing upon actions at times has been unacceptable. <br><br>I have seen certain kinds of physical groups around but it&#39;s not just physical and I am not certain it&#39;s the kind of physical groups that some think but it might be. <br><br>Psychictivty:<br>Drinking, and how there is energies prompting us when to drink and how much, I have felt as a psychictivity in which has felt machinisms and energies as to why we take at last sips of drink from invoking of arm energies to spiritual mechanisms in regards to our throat areas and potentially within our drink. There was also a tell as to the amount of energies that some physical are experiencing. <br><br>Informational Creation:<br>Regardless Teams (AJH Daily Defensives Board - X1 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br><br>Advocationals:<br>The Learning and Teaching pertaining to the let knows I have done. <br>There has been a bit of thing in regards to regardless mentality, regardless of us defending ourselves, us still receiving defense and believing that we are and just that interaction is not reflecting it at times Which can also constitute at times that we are not receiving a certain kind of defense.  <br>Out of the matrix kind of psychic understanding that expands upon multiple fronts targeted by way of my life and the kinds of acts done with some with incarnate opportunities looking upon and choosing not to incarnate while others still on the fence, still many willing to incarnate too a certain extent to give it a try pertaining to certain kinds of psychic experiences. They say I chose this Psychic experience and if I did for true then I would admit such in the away that my Main Spirit Guides indicated indicated given context. If it wasn&#39;t that per say I still want to endorse what my Main Spriit Guides indicated by way of me not deserving harm upon learning spiritual knowledge that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>Certain kind trying to get the ones responsible for harm and hurt that has happened, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) and a certain kind blocking and saying that I am the one to blame, there are also those told that i am the one to blame and punishment alternatives kinds. <br>Certain kind in regards to life utilization family in which have lost loved ones, funds and account in regards  pertaining to alternatives that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and incentives monetaries and compensation pertaining to those alternatives. <br>Abstract writing and write down what come to mind and mindless writing as well attacked potentially on my end.<br><br><br>Daily Mantra: Peace, Love, Happiness, Sadness, Hope Faith, Worship, Clarifications, Science, Vaping, Dreams, Intimacy, Saving, <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
