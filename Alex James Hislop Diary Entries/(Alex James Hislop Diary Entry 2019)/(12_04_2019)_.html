Dec 16, 2019, 3:58:37 AM</div>
<div class="title">(12/04/2019) </div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>I looked at an article yesterday. There was blurb about how some of the nations are putting money into quantum computing and there was a let know of edge in regards to intelligence by achieving quantum computing which might be why some of the nations are funding such projects. I immediately stopped reading the article because it pissed me off. I look at the world in a certain manner and the fact that some of us a squabbling and attacking one another, grown up nations with grown up pants still trying to get one another when we need to be working together. We need to stop focusing on trying to steal from each other and work together. I think banners and nations are good and needed but at times they have not provided the freedom that they espouse. At times they have not given liberty. It&#39;s partially because they work against each other and can&#39;t stop measuring. It end up getting in the way of quality of life and safety if not done right. This planet needs more than what the individual nations can achieve. Some get angry about globalism because of national identity and unfairness not willing to take but I find it interesting spiritually for certain a conversation that World Leaders of Earth would lose. Peace and Love. It&#39;s not a lack of leadership that fails each nation spiritually but a lack of higher light support. A lack of higher Setting support. And those that continue to play the good spirit that are blocking such support. A God that hasn&#39;t forgotten that has been protecting but seemingly is nowhere to be seen. To be true I am just upset at times. Who wouldn&#39;t be in understanding some of the truths of the world even if just in baseline form. The Spiritualist Communities speak about God and Love, the afterlife of care and compassion, places where we go when we pass on and those True Good places are sometimes not in the vicinity. It&#39;s not fair and it&#39;s suppose to be. Suppose to be isn&#39;t good enough though, not when their at your doorstep with torches and pitchforks. If you have followed the themes throughout these Diary Entries, you know I have seen some of the darker side and one of the most important thing you should take from it is that the Good exist. Is that the Good are more powerful and that there is Good in the form of nations. Looking at the world with positivity can change everything. Every God spark that looks at the world in a positive way is another win for the Good Guys and that you don&#39;t have to be worry about it either in a certain sense because by way of the Good outweighing the Bad especially Nationally on this Physical Planet Earth creates a safety net in which exists but the bigger one is that spiritually there is a Good that exists in which can safeguard from negative ripple effect while still maintaining balance. Utilization of such negatives can be decent at times and there is ways to achieve such measures with quality of life and safety. Just because we are protected in such manners doesn&#39;t mean we should take liberty but understanding there there are good negatives in which there is nothing wrong with expressing, Anger can be good and freeing and when we harness that anger with fairness we can achieve greatness. When we present sadness it lets us know that we are human. That we bleed tears of see through. It&#39;s an indicator at times. Depression can be a release and coping in life. Three emotions and energies in which can be decent given context. When you mix that with the happiness, Joy and excitement as well all of the other positivity it lets know of a decent ripple effect.<br>I have talked about it before but again I am going to try and let know about story. I watched a western film in which I truly enjoy. Sometimes I have noted certain kinds of films seemingly impacted by mine and others spiritual viewings and I would notice personal themes, Metaphorical and symbolism within the story itself. I have seen shapings happen in regards to certain characters sometimes in the form of my own family but also sometimes in regards to other people I know about in regards to earth. It&#39;s not exclusive to me but when you take into account some of the gravity in understand some of my actions there can be a certain things that happens in which has been classically associated with the famous and even powerful. Can you imagine watching a film that laments in a clear way in which you understand upon a conversation that you just had hours previous in regards to your own life and some of the situations in which is then seen through the movie? Some way it&#39;s serendipitous and others say it&#39;s a coincidence but it also speaks of certain kind of potentially being utilized in a certain manner as well as noting the way time works in the spirit world. That there can be an interaction that takes place upon someone viewing a content experience years before in which sees  certain spiritual contact from those time frames. In the spirit there are those that might be able to traverse from either time frame safely in which explained in a certain manner is less scary. We talk about in the context of filming and the subject matter and maybe it lends towards that sort of thing where it is less scary anyhow because it is done in a normal way. There are also ways to be able to speaks to the present from the past, heck, creating a letter to the future in the past can see the eventual present that will pass take note. So let&#39;s say you talk about a break up that happens and it being about a broken cup. That it scarred your life. Then when you watched that movie there being a scenes in which one of the actors looks like one of the people in regards to the breakup conversation, one of the dialogue mirrors exactly what was said in the conversation an inflection change reflects the other person the conversation and then a cup breaks in the scene in which scars one of the characters hands. It&#39;s also in the details of observation, in understanding that inflection changes and expression changes are taking place and that it is partially in the spirit lends towards being able to see these storlyines within the films that we experience. Some of the storylines I have been able to note has had to do with seeing things on my side of the screen facilitated in a certain manner in which reflect spiritual activity on our side of the screens upon watching content and other kinds. One of the reasons why certain things seemingly shine through in regards to story symbolism and other kinds is partially by way of talking about it before hand and even after specifically in the context of film content experience impact. There was moments in regards to the film where it felt like there was entire spirits and peoples in regards to the gunslingers themselves in a certain context<br><br>- (Woke up and sensed a different direction. Before going I chirped out what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. It was one of those things were people express themselves and I am glad that were not two steps away from that equilibrium ban on art and expression but the again with all bullshit who knows if they are the good guys. When I woke up the next moralizing, this morning I had sensed a certain kind around me. This happy go lucky friend bullshit at last from some kind because there might be another kind trying to pull others in the mix. Kind demeanor in which was revealed to be a certain kind of protection. A certain kind of defense but also a certain kind of culture. Smart and smooth. Reminded of certain kinds of agencies. Either way there was a deal struck so said, of course myself and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) were going with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated for us to go with the way my Main Spriit Guides indicated. The deal though was on the subject itself of Main Spiritual Guideship, what was chosen supposedly in regards to me was what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Interestingly enough though it&#39;s already been what my Main Spriit Guides indicated in regards to myself and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) regardless if it makes it to certain areas or not. I think it was more to do with the spirit anyhow and I feel that my Main Spriit Guides information has been making it through to the areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Either way it looked to be a certain kind of verbal sparring with me in the mix to a certain degree. There was a moment where things changed though. They insinuated that my Main Spriit Guides information hadn&#39;t been getting through at times and that this new deal on my end wasn&#39;t truth in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light.  It was interesting that explained in thinking that it is logical in my position to go with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light in which is partially based off of Faith but also history and reason. It&#39;s one thing to say that somehow down on this physical earth it&#39;s not fully known, in the spiritual though it&#39;s another matter though. Either way it looked like two groups in which core interests didn&#39;t necessarily lie with my vision but both have been trying. Both have been trying to help and when you have a civilian and god knows what else in the mix partially dictating matters of self and god knows what else it can be a difficult situation. But not that difficult right? It&#39;s also a reality check for some that didn&#39;t know that his Main Spirit Guides are quite in the mix in certain areas. The way I see it, they are working together and their is priority but the priority that is set in higher light is not being facilitated even with factoring the other-dimensional existences.)<br>- (crazy ANTICS AND DIRECTION ABOUT GOING OUT TODAY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. i AM NOT SURE WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT BUT THEY POINTED TO a certain spot in town near the end of dead end road. This had to do with a checkup and also going out to one of the local spots that I go where there is a certain allocation of resources in which is being mixed up with reasonings for others wanting to go over there. A certain kind of story line and movement of certain kind defending and cleaning certain things up, the good guys so said spiritual maneuvering through certain areas. Multiple story lines brought up of a federation of planets. Talk again about different kind of saving and defense needed and a certain kind freaking out this day while other remained calm, here is a hint it was a mixed bag of good and bad on either side. )<br>- - (During Halo play through there was multiple kinds of spiritual movements behind the scenes discerned)<br>- (Multiple argumentatives and defensive works happening in let know of certain kind utilizing this place and others in a certain maneuver to help certain kind supposedly where myself and other did not necessarily benefit so said but I am not certain if that&#39;s true)<br>- (Later at night a story moment happened when I put on a content about the movies. I didn&#39;t watch the first episode but I talked about the movies a bit which changed the direction of my process to a certain extent, more discussion about interaction and ripple effect from in which was warranted to a certain degree. The content though that was playing let know of some the stories on set and I feel there was an overlap about some of the of events that took place spiritually as well. I walked in on Die Hard being spoken about and found it fascinating some of the behind the scenes and it had that real love of the movies feel to it. I followed it up with watching The Quick and the Dead in which I really love that film, everything about it speaks to me and the way it was filmed was beautiful. I mainly focused on love throughout the film, creating love while enjoying content lends something to it at times but doesn&#39;t have too. I felt a spirit of film about me and it was a really cool experience in which linked multiple storylines on my end. Symbolism and metaphorical seen throughout the film in which also spoke about one of the topics talked about that had to do with some experiencing portions of our lives in a certain manner. That film experience really hit home, from the preacher and priest storyline, God seemed to be around in multiple capacities as I felt those energies, moments of sadness, love and anger, even depression. There was scenes which felt the anger and destruction of rape where two gunslinger duel in the rain. <br>- (One of the things discerned is creating links and bridge by way of actors in regards to certain peoples of earth, there are already is myriads of different connections anyhow but more have been discerned in regards to the physical in which shouldn&#39;t take away other links and connections. Still discerned certain actors in which have been shaped in certain ways pertaining to my process.)<br>- (there was perspective by the end of the night in which was said to have been harmed in regards to me, they made it look like it happened when I watched certain film and my process changed upon talking about normal things and also cinema,  but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the case and spiritually it might look like it was actually done earlier when there was more turbulence but either way so said on this day there was said to be anatomy and spiritual infrastructure damaged in the likeness of being brain dead where a certain perspective channeled through and looked like nobodies was home. Like he was hurt and handicapped. Is their a great healing in regards to this because I have seen miracles happen in many forms. I don&#39;t know if this had to do with me persay or something else. Sometimes the spirit let know of things through psychic mediums especially those in the spotlight.)<br><br>Themes: <br>#Sense #Logic #Safety #Freedom #Deployment #Situations #Updates #Planets #FrederationOfPlanets #QualityOfLife #Safety #Intelligence <br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
