<div class="title">(04//22/2020) &quot;Sight of True Good&quot;</div>
<div class="content">“Developing integrity is an essential part of recovery from the Nice Guy Syndrome. My definition of integrity is &quot;deciding what feels right and doing it.”<br>― Robert A. Glover, No More Mr. Nice Guy<br><br>&quot;When do we start experiencing what we want to experience? When we choose to experience what we want to experience. Cross referencing of choice included.&quot;<br>- Anon<br><br>Poetry: <br>&quot;Sweet Blaze is a step away from Bliss.&quot;<br>- Anon <br><br>Activity:<br>How does the world work when things run only so slowly and yet so fast for others and the positive to be talked about I have had difficulty in a certain sense with the idea that maybe things have gotten better although the swing the hoops yesterday maneuver early morning seemed a bit much, I am wondering if it is more true than not. This doesn&#39;t change the fact that I have been continuing present in present time in many ways as we have seen for a while now. It&#39;s enough to start something new but never forgotten the continued been one day after another, I keep thinking things are going to get better and I have continued to support Good and go with the percentages that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. As big as Nasa is a good comparison that even the understatement doesn&#39;t deny the levels that exist upon existence. They are many and will defend many. It&#39;s the scare that might be too much for some and others don&#39;t want to here it. but it seems that just when we start to get going things streamlines fix is what it has been. Very grateful indeed but I think the truth is still understood for it be clear in what direction I want this to go. Good Direction. That my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Original Light, Original Setting and Original Setting, do what the one that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. This could change directions and help and should be understood for what it is, nothing wrong but good sense and direction in which deserves the support and spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides relayed. In the event there is billions of spirits and more so watching and interacting with some of our content creation and ways of life to be true than I feel what my Main Spirit Guides relayed in the Light. It&#39;s the answer of it all for a reason but it&#39;s a normality that exists in which has been mistaken for something in which it is not and many do have that answer in a societal fashion in fact it&#39;s coming from those kinds of places in which do not get attacked and are always protected. When things seemed dull it might have been which works given the kind of life it should be and the kinds of lives those that my Main Spirit Guides relayed should be able to live. How did it come this far with moment being another crashing tidal wave of grief and sadness, insurmountable. Remorse. I am not certain if repent should be there either but Holy Justice does exist in many forms. The Chariot seen in the day time that holds the many keys. There is thanks for the service spiritual have done to keep me safe and I think there should utilization of Amenities and excellent experiences that satisfies. Why wouldn&#39;t we want to live life the way we want too. Non-Harmful but still enjoy what we want too, why would we ever want to harm is an answer easily understood and sometimes it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with experiences, sometimes it might have to do with what one doesn&#39;t want to experience. Prime Experiences. Satisfaction. Brilliance Imagination and Wonder. Pulse Beat. The Octopus and the Heart. The Shark. I Fear Sharks. I Fear Spiders. The have been haunting me quite regularly regarding to be true and the metaphorical regarding when I saw what they did earlier might have changed, It was around the 1st or 2nd of April, 2020. They had tried to use the metaphorical bigged up at times in regards how I have worse fears and how I was afraid of my family being attacked. They knew that my worst fears were always that and that the metaphorical in regards to spiders and sharks and the kinds of things they had been doing fired a storyline about this fear to make it worse and potentially to try it have happen but I feel they have always been protected. I feel that Jamie has been protected and my household family safe. The interactions regarding them lets know they are fine many different maneuverings dimensionally discerned and I feel they could be safe as well upon analysis couple with spiritual information and experience setup with the amount of things that exist to save especially the True Good around and the movements regarding. True Good has arrived. It&#39;s been what it is, everyday more and it continues to take place and it continues to be getting over and saved. Defense in the moment of that kind maneuvering that has been happening seems to be the best route. Fantasies were played out through the night on my end, deep ones I didn&#39;&#39;t fully understand exactly what that was and they kept bringing up that in which has hung around for a while now at times that I had liked someone at one point and I didn&#39;t think there was anything wrong with that to be true, I thought it was healthy and brilliant in the beginning wasn&#39;t it something people cared about, It&#39;s like when you get down too it, it&#39;s a bit of a small in the mix, a desire and love, care and set free to the places it wanted to be. How many times in the beginning with a small explanation as to what it was and what it is that excites most people, that makes them happy that made those that they we wanted happy to be happy. Truly. True. I was scared about what I had done in this life and what they insinuated to me that the favorite thing about me was always going to be safe and that how I was before was a tell as to how some felt. It&#39;s the small things in life I suppose that can be not what some insinuated at times. Fantasies played out different because what am I but a long length of moments passing through me to be true on the billions and trillions low lengths end of the time spectrum and I spoke true even if twisted into something I never wanted to be and why would I want to live if the given tells in life if honesty was a truth and there is a Good God left to be true. Operatives of a Lonely Heart. I love who I am for a reason because it speaks of others and what they wanted in life and what they wanted to experience, always of those that wanted people and spiritual to experience what they wanted to experience and last night it was like subconscious something took place and played out fantasies in some other dimensional area. My Fantasy was always that. but something she told me about moderation and that it doesn&#39;t always have to be the best, it can be fun and spontaneous. It can be something that someone wanted to experience, it can be chosen from lists of desires and things that people like to experience not necessarily what they ultimately wanted to experience. I can feel the Euphoria from such fantasies overlapping me take place and I can feel excitement in my emotion areas, I can feel that there is spiritual through experiencing certain fantasies. I still care about my own and how that is personal, about how much that matters regardless of being in front of the scenes or not. I do not feel this is because of giving up and I do not feel this is because people were attacked, but I do feel the stimuli experienced in this life in regards to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated have made me feel a certain way. At what point do you not experience what you want to experience especially given the amount of good on Earth-Based. I especially discern a spiritual of Earth protecting places of noteworthy interest on the lines of the map but it only goes so far. God presence sensed in the other places. Love was the answer. It always was and it always will be. It&#39;s what spiritual continue to let know within Near Death Experiences and they that my Main Spirit Guides indicated are going to the Good Place that my Main Spriit Guides relayed. Some are going now while incarnate. It seems it wasn&#39;t just afterlife but also during life that good were most situating. Spiritual and people tired of watching some receiving ill benefits from this process and others. Ecstasy. I supposedly never tried it in this life but maybe the point is that I didn&#39;t have too, the too high on life mentality seemed almost moot for the exception of the point that it wasn&#39;t and I could feel the spiritual attachments to that drug in which amazingly can exist in many different forms besides, me sitting at my desk working seemed to activate that can kind of drug and stimuli in which there are real energy streams and stimuli regarding. The Drugs are beautiful to be true and I know who I want to be. The kinds of stuff that exists within higher spirit is understood at times for a portion to be viewer discretion is advised and there is nothing wrong with that. I thought about some of my favorite stimuli and with no bad side affects, no coughing upon smoking and the clean nature that it can be enacted to lend fourth to multiple kinds of ways to consume and activate the drugs I wanted to create. Without any of the bad things associated like ill health and even addiction for a portion, although some of it was taken with addiction for many reasonings, one of which is that addiction doesn&#39;t have to be a bad thing. All kinds of ways to be able to experience what you want to experience and the perimeter works are there as they have been for a long time now. A simple cross referencing of what you want to experience with what Guardians that your Main Spriit Guides relayed indicated. All of sudden it works through weaving taking certain portions you wanted to experience away but not to the degree that some have you believe. For example you may not go to an area anymore that you went to when you were younger. You might stay away from certain spiritual now. You might stay away from certain experiences. In the end the cross referencing really keeps safe and is suppose to keep safe while providing you with what you wanted to experience and to keep you away from what you didn&#39;t want to experience. My Spiritual is always experiencing things that I wanted to experience so if you are in a dark place always remember that you experiencing the things you wanted to experience overlapping so close to you that it pales the bad and ails your sickness. Cleanses your soul and shouldn&#39;t be forgotten and misunderstood. It&#39;s simple not enough truth that still drive many to save and protect but to be the example that continues to drive fourth something happening is also not good enough. I went for a walk and felt older interactions specifically in regards to voice emerge as if from a dream. I wonder what it was all about. At what point do we not look upon the voices of reason to be just and in correct action upon the disparities somewhat not foretold especially in ways in which were needed truly. I saw something today and it had to do with a certain variable that reminds of realism. The intellect. The balance of mental and mind as well as other kinds in which as been in association with the intellect. Green, see through light green. One of the colours noted but potentially different than the see through seen earlier, see through earlier looked more light green more Buddhisms kind of green this reminds me of intellect green. Then the bad stuff that happened is claimed to have not been happening by way of this person being crazy. It&#39;s one of the most important points to be understood for what it is and is understood for what it is as has been seen by the presence of good in multiple kinds of manners. <br><br>Compassion <br>Love<br>Care<br><br>The lines of Compassion Love and Care have clashed with Intellect, Mind and Mental at times and it&#39;s that these two groupings as well as the other included in regards to these groupings are sometimes pitted against one another. When they are two groupings of traits and characteristic as well as the other kinds that exist for a certain amount of Good in which some of which have been classified as true good. Think of this, the capacity and understanding to be able to withstand a certain amount of knowledge in regards to acts of immorality and darkness is an important pursuit especially from those power up tops in leadership positions to be able to figure out some of the problems that exist. What then but need for compassion, care and love to be able to still feel those concepts for what is being witnessed. The other struggle is by way of having such capacity in regards to certain kinds of knowledge that there still needs to be a compassion regarding which speaks of moral compass. Intellect in ways to proceed. There are machinsism that exist upon going crazy that I have felt to be more than just going crazy and I feel there are those who operate fine through said craziness for many different reasons. One of which happens to do with spiritual feng shui and being to fen shui certain people and spiritual to not feel crazy while crazy machinisms take place. Psychictivity revealing multiple kinds of head area machinisms seemingly for some of it to be operating in crazy fashion but really not crazy at all. Safeguards of healing. Body machinsms and spiritual machinisms. They have utilized visuals of harm being said to be the reason for going crazy and certain mechanisms firing at times it&#39;s also claimed that someone being crazy didn&#39;t actually see something that made them crazy. You understand there is dark out there that would utilize natural machinisms in how what some have labelled crazy in a different than what was intended and there is utilization at times in regards to such machinisms in dark ways. My own spiritual and psychictivity have been fairly decent on my end and have let known of certain spiritual experiences that have cause certain other dimensional to operate in a certain fashion in which a decent sized of portion might have been good experiences but not all of it. You can imagine someone seeing something bad take place and then the firings of such spiritual mechanisms related to spiritual anatomy for a portion, that some have been sensing to be associated with craziness done so to protect and heal by way of different therapeutics because that is a portion of which but as has been seen in this process and others that my Main Spirit Guides relayed, that it doesn&#39;t mean we are crazy but rather a therapeutic utilization of healing machinisms. <br><br>Something happens where in other dimensional aspects getting harmed by way of it being said that certain harm took place and claiming that the reason why certain <br><br>Intellect<br>Mind <br>Mental<br><br>Some would have you believe that if you are of the mindset that most if not all of certain percentage that my Main Spirit Guides indicated should be saved that you are potentially not in the correct headspace in which is utter lunacy especially upon some of the baselines existing within many, large percentages that my Main Spirit Guides relayed feel that most should be saved. Because of whatever variable it is, there are those that have ventured past for many reasons. That somehow to have care and compassion to be a bad thing for scare of going for the full save chit. The lines of intellect and love need to heal together and bring fourth a new era of spirituality that already exists and is already here as has been seen by of the many different kinds of experiences and sight of the True Good. <br><br>Peace: Practice with belief. <br>Light: The world is complete by having a sense of wonder.
