<div class="title">(09/25/2019) &quot;The Player Hater&#39;s Ball&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>- I woke up today feeling more spiritually seemingly than usual. I think some of my behavior was impacted throughout the night by way of spiritual influence. certain infrastructure in regards to earth-base spirituality was move d around in a certain sense and some of it placed upon me.<br>- I also woke up and remembered something that had been pointed out yesterday that I had seen and it had to do with how I would proceed in my process. Certain things understood spiritually in regards to the events that have taken place in which would cause me to be more calm and operate a way I wanted to operate that would make me happy. Choosing happiness upon some of the devastation that has happened to my life and others. I think some looked around yesterday at times and realized alongside myself at times throughout the day that were not going to hear about some of the things certain spirit are throwing at us through the day. There has been this hanging energy at times in regards to getting things done. That&#39;s one of them for myself in a certain context that I don&#39;t want to feel any longer in the context portrayed. I looked at some of the expression manipulation in regards to myself as well as some psychological influencing behind the scenes and then the kind of emphasis in regards to small things throughout the day like argumentative moments as well as me speaking with my out loud voice in communication with certain spirits as to why I was getting attacked at times contrasting with the amount of spiritual turbulence and things taking place behind the scenes with a moment I pointed it out and the gravity of how unfair and hypocritical it looked emerged. I feel that spirits looking at their own is needed and has been happening to a certain extent. One of the things I looked at yesterday on my front lawn in the middle of certain  spiritual assemblies was the thought that certain spirit attack my anti-camp, certain spirit working against in which then some of them we actually my other-dimensional selves in which were then combined with me. At what point do you not look at that in regards to some of the stuff you experienced. Instead of going there I went to what others are experiencing behind the scenes. The potential that some are experiencing certain kinds of activity that has been labelled as not so. I did multiple advocations yesterday but one of the key ones had to do with understanding what we are experiencing behind the scenes.<br>- Yesterday another thing talked about was spiritual influencing in the regards of working and the desire to work drying up upon working via spiritual influencing and when not wanting to work all of a sudden the feeling of wanting work reappearing. The block of those trying to work in regards to manipulation and changing of what one feels or is feeling pertaining to what one feels. There as another that is potentially the bigger problematic that is linked to this sort of thing.  It has to do with what those that influence are going through in regards to being coerced and sometimes forced into manipulating and influencing. Are some of them doing it for survival? The idea that there is some in which are perpetuating that sort of influencing to take place. Not the influencers, not the influencees but rather another party in which is trying to make it more difficult for some to work. Now, you continue along that line to find out if it really that kind of group and you will probably find that there is multiple kind in which are not truly the ones responsible until you reach the end of the rope to find who is responsible.  <br>- Another groups I have noticed tasked with trying to make me more anti-authoritative has been influencing within the past 4 or 5 five days.<br>- A certain reminiscent in regards to watching Ice Cube&#39;s Gangster Rap Made Me Do It, from moments of process past when I would approach situations with a different mentality. Not always defending but rather lamenting and celebrity culture I didn&#39;t understand fully with respect. Laughing about small things in which I didn&#39;t fully realize in multiple regards then and now. This had to do with Anti-Camp culture a certain kind to be truth. <br>- I learned how to switch energy bodies in regards to myself and other machinisms to different ways of live specifically having to do with morality and immorality. I maneuvered some of them  on good infrastructure and maneuvered off of bad infrastructure. <br>- I started writing in regards to the Cursed Colours literature and I added a scenes in regards to my practice which energized with the novel that I was using in a certain context pertaining to my practice writing. The scenes had to with Stan when he was talking Micheal. I changed the names of the characters as well as some of the subject matter to fit into spiritual sc-fi. The next scenes I created instead of Black killing himself classically in regards to the novel I changed the scenes to reflect Positivity Evolution scene in regards to what Black, one of the Characters I changed Stan towards in which reminded me of the many depictions of fantastical things taking place around black. From marching audio to spheres of prophecy it looked to be a certain kind of update that was fairly advanced and rare. Certain event on my end took place as well. The let know of movies and film in regards to what I write as well as potentially other write. Smooth clean energy vibrations. I also had two thoughts, one about physical light and how there could life within in which spiritual interaction for some of it might be slow enough to be able to interact and see that light stream moving, like years of being able to see the light moving from  a kitchen fixture to the wall and potentially even reflected. Lamented upon how much time is passing in the Original pertaining to some of our lives. Like billions and trillions of years worth of time. There was also a moment where I was trying bend spoons with my mind and I could feel a certain luqidity taking place in the areas that I was trying to use to turn the spoon to bend potentially placement of this stimuli near the spoon would bent it, nonetheless there was power within belief and making it bend in which I then utilized towards the Callwords that my main Spirit Guides indicated. There was also the events taking place in this room upon leaving up disclaimers and that the actions of those that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. Earlier they tried to say that I didn&#39;t save a group of spirits during a certain movement but I am wondering if that had anything to do with me. <br>- <br><br>Advocations:<br>A display and way I can point towards 25 years from now in regards to how I want my process to be setup. <br>Areas of this process that are suppose to stay the same. ie, positivity area a portion which is suppose to balance out some of things I say in this process by way of safety. ie, an area for those that save, some of which in regards to Ri Culture. <br><br>Documents Created:<br><br>Themes:<br>#Influencing #Manipulation #Blame #Debate #Conversation #Gangsters #Anti-CampCulture #InformationalDisplays #Banners #Venting #Culture #GoogleKeep #Family #Spotlight #Understanding #Reveals<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
