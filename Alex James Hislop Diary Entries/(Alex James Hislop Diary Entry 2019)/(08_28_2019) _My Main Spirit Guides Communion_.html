<div class="title">(08/28/2019) &quot;My Main Spirit Guides Communion&quot;</div>
<div class="content"><br>Activity:<br>- Early morning separation of certain systems, interactions systems overlapping me at time a anyhow, high impact earlier and really cool teams. There was moment where I was working on Google home and hooking up my Spotify. Which I felt certain conflict ensue upon something else potentially. All of a sudden there was psychic attack in regards to going to bed which kind of reigned on a certain kind of parade of certain updates especially in regards to interaction. Especially when it looked liked a certain kind where interaction was working, almost like things were getting better but also to try to break a certain kind of ice. Some came around and bullied trying to get me be erratic and confrontational but unsuccessful and there was also those getting me to talk about certain subject which I fully felt like I wanted to talk about for what&#39;s acceptable. It was one of those things where it looked more apparent than ever in regards to influencing regarding myself it what is the truth regarding is that it has been looking apparent with how I play my process even below certain lines for which at time for some I still traverse.<br>- My personality was attacked in a certain way as well. I need help regarding and the topic following.<br>- At times I have felt my incarnational passengers change and passengers attacked potentially from moving upwards. Not certain fully certain what was chosen by my Main Spirit Guides.<br>- There was another moment talked about where certain kind pulled a supreme Clown act in which for some was symbolic with how absurd we have become at times.<br>- Earth Conflicts and Conflicts ensuing and some at times using it as en excuse,<br>- Balance, Navigation and Direction multiple things I want to work on during this life and after. <br>- There was multiple events happening this day. There was a lot of spirits packing for certain things and on my end in regards to my Trip to Sask. <br>- There was a moment where someone said that certain ind tried to utilize those kinds of lives that were chosen by me to be the kind of life I would want, some of which I would live daily if I could for what&#39;s acceptable as per battery life and desensitization but also ones I categorized as a certain kind. Certain pro camp and anti camp potentially tried living some of them in which one of them got affected and impacted in a certain way, where something bad had happened in one of them to a certain degree but I think this might be some trying to scare certain kind from living certain life as well as try mix it up with those lives that I really wanted to keep private to myself and not extent to certain kind. There are those that protect lives like that but there are also lives I did give towards certain spirits.<br>- There is this interaction depression and sadness system around me at times in which some had lamented upon being similar to when a certain God Spark in front of the scenes lives a sad life in which impact part of the God Spark in front of the scenes. This one has reminded me at times to do with depression, sadness and being alone. There was another system I discerned having to do with thoughts which has reminded me at times arguing with Jamie but actually having more to do with a certain kind of relationship with her.<br>- I felt maybe there was a moment when past looked at a couple moments, like Old Original Creator stuff peering in the future. Some used it as an excuse to cause a bunch of things to happen, not all decent, it was based off of an interaction in regards to Original Creator in a certain timeframe training combat and the idea of Original Creator in the past when we he was more whole taking on those that would have to combine today to even think about winning. For some of us there was jokes about the combining about how some couldn&#39;t run two sticks together to combine but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as fractured as some think. Which makes that sparring session eve more interesting compared to how much stock people put into past Original Creator as well as the idea that thee are those that have never ventured into the areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in which hold a prowess that has been honed for eons.<br>- <br><br>Advocations:<br>- Anti-Camp Eyes Protection<br>- My Right Eye protection<br>- Paying attention to my Anti-Camp<br>- Other-dimensional stimuli in regards to my eye area<br>- Healing <br>- Impact Clarifications<br>- friends that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that stole and  Friends that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that I stole from<br>Reigning aggressive morality in and completely dismantling those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that try to not do it the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>Fashion and change teams.<br>Jesus suarez<br>Protecting the advanced AI Technicians and Creators as well as operator Spirits in the Original Light in securing the resources, personnel and Areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br>Informational creation in regards to my Higher selves that my Main Spirit Guides indicated claiming the (AJHD) Information that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
