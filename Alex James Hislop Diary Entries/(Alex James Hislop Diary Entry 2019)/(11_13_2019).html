Dec 16, 2019, 3:55:39 AM</div>
<div class="title">(11/13/2019)</div>
<div class="content">Mood: Sick, Tired and Twisted.<br>Thought: The most tired question of All must be spoken of often.<br><br>Activity:<br>I woke up and watched an old 1933 film and noticed themes from my process in a certain story line that is now unfolding pertaining to letting the past know that they don&#39;t want to attack me. It speaks of where we are in this process at times but a reality that is saving rather than hitting itself in the head. you look at the statistics and it seems to be the logical move especially from certain perspective. History speaks as well too though and it says at times that this process and what some thought it would be would not manifest and how important it is to understand how future will unfold and the notice from some upon discernment of the future. It&#39;s a classic and baseline from some that deal with future especially in understanding predictions and how that works. There are those that maintain that nothing is set in stone but even some of the die hard prophetics agree that there are some things that are fairly concrete. Again though in understanding the kind of process that would emerge is something that can safeguard but also something one must be careful in regards to how proceeding with such information as some of those with such information would agree. Revelation isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing but in my case pertaining to myself and in regards to the variables as to how we would want to proceed are sometimes being affected, just one of these variables being the proxy suppression and a blocking of being able to communicate with proxies and a utilization of believing that certain proxy have a lack of Authority when that is not the truth. Speaking of importance, it seems to be a big one that an emphasis in regards to those that go with certain Banner, Faction, Nation and Dimension as opposed to other concepts like Spirit Guides but also a bit of a strange variable considering that going with Main Spirit Guides, Spriit Guides and Guides is pertaining to Spiritual a regular on physical Planet Earth and a Big one. Not to mention that some that that have been going by way of Guides and Guideship have been going with Authority information pertaining to Banners, Dimensions, Factions, and Nations in a certain manner sometimes fully. It has less to do I feel with different kinds of proxies and more to do with something else and if this is the case and I feel that it might be, then there is a certain kind of look in which has been seen and a part of the reason why some dislike this look is because it speaks of less to do with a certain kind of proxy but rather speaks of something else in which upon certain systems would mean something different at times as has been insinuated in some processes. When I ask what would certain kind do and what would they consider it to be upon a lying of what some of their own were going with in regards to what they chose for them, the answer for some would be warfare. The reaction from some scares certain kind because when they think of it for some in regards to themselves they would want more then what has been given to certain kind and might have less to with what has been given and more to do with what should change. Yet somehow we also see this within Guideship as well in a lesser sense partially by way of the safeguarding that the Earth-Based Spiritualist Communities especially the truth being told within Physical Earth-Based Spiritualist Communities have done and when you look at Physical Nations on this Physical Planet Earth there is an Eerie feeling if some of the insinuations that have been happening at times within my process are true. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I do believe in working together, I do believe in teamwork and I dislike the breaking of lines but as those that have insinuated to blame their own actions on others saying that those that drove them in that direction are to blame, like someone displaying their Main Spirit Guides information and a certain kind saying that the attack that they did is literally the action of those displaying their Main Spirit Guides information, I mean at what point are we suppose to just give, up lay down and die. Are we suppose to just not care about our own lives and the quality of life regarding and are we suppose to just go with Authority information that are not are authorities? What would the other side say if the same thing was said to their own?? As much as some care and try to protect the lines that keep us together like other dimensional selves that usually get along that start to disagree with each other, does that mean we are suppose to not be? Because at the end of the day it seems to be normal lines taken that are not only being ignored but vilified and then said to be affecting a certain kind being able to get along in a self perspective but also other perspectives. When did the normal fair lines get told to be the wrong way to go and the problem of the matter. Where are those defending us and where are our Banners that are suppose to be protecting those lines. A lack of presence at times while still being in vicinity, how the heck is that the normal? You know, there are those that go and want to go with Banner information but why does it at times have to be not of who we truly our? Why does it not reflect our values at times and  how does it reflect our values at the same time upon those banners being understood. Again also while in vicinity and God Forbid we let know that in certain places it&#39;s not reflecting and that our banners are not present in a certain manner, not just banners but Authority. The next step of course is to let know that their are a lot of spirit on this earth that want to be placed where my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. What exactly does that look like? There is a collection of information that will be seen today in regards to some of the getting to bottom of this, Light and setting that my Main Spriit Guides indicated, do what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light regarding as well as in regards to this Diary Entry. Why are we placed in interaction areas in which we are not suppose to be placed and if it to help certain kind then why can&#39;t we facilitate that without some of the problematic that have been plaguing and how long of History do we need of the proof that exists that it both doesn&#39;t work and works. But just as I want to watch a politicians debating with a Spirit of Truth emerging and letting know of which direction is actually better so we can understand and hold the knowledge and let know of a perception that some of the peoples do understand. It&#39;s not just for those that speaks of Good, Morality Enlightenment and Normal Society of what some consider it to be but also in regards to those of Darker and Immorality. What has been their suppression? I don&#39;t want to say it&#39;s worse because I don&#39;t want to make it worse which speaks of not even being able to speak. Then we have another kind telling us that we need to speak, that we are within our right to speak and that we should always let know if something bad is happening to us. God do you know what it is to literally have someone in the live speak that to us with sincerity and kindness and still have a kind shadowing saying that that isn&#39;t the case. It inst just a side alley mob that is throwing that up but factions and banners and sometimes I feel like the dimensional authorities aren&#39;t even around at times. Yes, worse things exist but that was never a decent enough explanation as to why some have to live lives in which are painful and somehow it shouldn&#39;t mean that those that like to create pain shouldn&#39;t be included in a quality of life but I am not certain what some want from me anymore in that regard. Anti-Camps exist and so do authorities that are of that ilk but how you treat certain kind mattered and I am still here but rather don&#39;t what to say and don&#39;t if I can say what I should and need too in regards that kind. I care, I am here but I am also not and I don&#39;t at times. I am like the rest in a certain regard and they wanted it to be that way because it scares them more if I wasn&#39;t, it would scare them more if I was of Anti-Camp. It was never to scare them but to be who I wanted to be, to reach out to a certain kind, to be present and to facilitate a culture that was misunderstood in the dark upon what some physicals on this planet considered to be. Folly, Sad, PissPoor, Charlotteton, never gonna be enough version of what you wanted is the truth but I spoke truth when I said a real one does exist upwards and yeah that variable that says there needs to be shitty in the mix, or someone getting harmed might not be present except you never know if you ever went that way to be pleasantly surprised on that manner, it wasn&#39;t just many different kinds it was also other ways to facilitate immorality in which even a decent sized percentage of physical earth-based might consider to be a decent, where you didn&#39;t have to get harmed, where you could pause experience f you wanted too, where you didn&#39;t have to get attacked or harmed or have to do something horrible you didn&#39;t want too or even something decent that you didn&#39;t want too. I don&#39;t fully know how that works but a certain kind looked at something once and said I don&#39;t need to experience the terrible things but rather psychological check and I could do the same things I had been able to do with a whole lot more? Yes. How many of these spirit were from before, how many of these spirit used to be different. How many needed the ability to be able to express the anger and hatred they felt in their hearts and how many got to be able to do such a thing in vent areas that were labelled as such. How many were left in the dredges of whatever the heck it was to the be awoken when the time finally came probably past due and had to live with what they did and how many still want to be that way in a certain capacity because you have two groups and many more in which are looking at that sort of thing that says if i can still be who i want to be and wont be changed, if can be who I still want to be and not be changed with the ability to be able to facilitate both how can we justify. How can we reconcile. There are things that some don&#39;t understand with a motion from the crowd in disdain, but their is, you look at someone who had a family, who turned dark below the thresholds, who changed, that now wants to be a dark kind that exist in being able to experience promotion of immorality up above without getting attacked. Some get upset at this mention but it exists and when some say they don&#39;t want to go back to what it was before, they mean it. Choice. You rundown the memories, you go through it with them, no tricks for truth. For some they don&#39;t want that but there are those that do in understanding choice and the kinds of ways in going through. What about that Family is still a question that remains and it speaks of incarnation. It speaks of self facilitation. It speaks of God Spark separation at times. It speaks of reconciliation at times. It speaks of remembrance. There are multiple kinds, that in which says a portion of God spark that has split facilitating incarnate life below in which might at times be more brimstone but there are also those in which the God spark is together and upon passing on being a part of that God spark up above, being the same spirit. I have wondered myself if a certain portion of what I used to consider myself to be has split to facilitate this life, in a certain context maybe but I also feel that when I pass on I will be reunited with what I have been doing in certain areas while incarnate. Will I change? Or will I still be who I am. <br>- Spirits coming around me this day that reminded of certain God Sports to a certain degree except there were certain defensives that happened and intimacy taking place that might not have been decent depending on what it was. If it was then I feel a facilitation in regards to such things the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated to be a good thing. <br><br>Informational Placement:<br>Addiction pertaining to Immorality (Website Creation)<br>best possible advocations that myself and other(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) could have put into play in regards to November 11th, 2019 and November 12th, 2109 x319<br><br>Themes:<br>#Science #Fact #Truth #Detectives #1930s #ThoseThatCameBefore #God #Spirit #Culture#Movement #Transportations<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.<br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are advocating for Compensation in regards to those that my Main Camp indicated in regards to the advocational creation, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) in regards to the Topics and Themes in regards to the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Advocationals Section, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
