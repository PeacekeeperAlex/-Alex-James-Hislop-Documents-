<div class="title">(11/03/2019) &quot;A Mentality and Point for the Ages&quot;</div>
<div class="content">A big topic of discussion these days is about Defense. I have seen my process change and move away from a certain a certain manners. I am still doing advocations and the new found way of doing advocations has been decent. The idea is that for some processes it might be better to try and different approach. This is not a bad thing, this can be a decent thing and you should be able to still associate with those in which you have been associating with in regards to past style, I am not saying not a break and I am not saying for some it would better to change pace and maybe stay away from certain spirit. There was an uncover of some things regarding defense but I still feel in how we respond to such things and not blame defense to be one of the focus points. One one hand it&#39;s good to see a certain interaction take place and continue to take place,  Understand for some they can&#39;t always be here but I still maintain that there should be certain kind of interaction. It might have to do with a change in setting, movement and different spiritual at times around myself but I still feel there is a decent sized amount of spirit who were with me down below at times  while some still recognize that it&#39;s maybe not as below some would consider to be, and I do feel there is dimensional still around me from when I was below certain thresholds and for some still operating the way they do. There is changes no doubt and I can feel some wanting me to move away from defensive topic point and freedom of rights issues and things of that nature but I still feel compelled to speak about these things for a reason. I do not feel like leaving that behind and I certainly don&#39;t want forget about those who were with me specifically in regards to defense works and how I operated in regards to defensives topics for the portions that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. The argumentatives still exist in spirit and other within content experience,s I like to vent because I need to vent and I also put on a show at times in regards to certain things. I am not trying to be upsetting but  feel a certain ways and there are those that it hold it down in that regard who not deserve to be attacked cause upon the discussion of defense topics and different ways to approach a process I feel that the argumentative should not be taken away because it&#39;s a good vent and it lends towards. You understand that just because i don&#39;t lament upon not wanting to leave certain kind behind that it doesn&#39;t constitute that somehow they should be left behind or that I am choosing to leave them behind. I choose what my Man Spriit Guides indicated. <br>- Another changing happening is one in which has to do with certain kind of disparities pertaining to how some are able to excel in regards to certain lives and the comparison regarding pertaining to fairness. <br>- A certain kind has been trying to a certain way in which might have to do with proximity and leeway given to utilize certain interaction systems and other kinds but another in which has been predominant at times speaks of certain kind trying to respond in a kind, caring and compassionate way upon some of the disparities existing in regards to certain, now I am not saying that that is exactly what is taking place especially upon me not wanting to have it be cause and i am careful in regards to how I word and let know of certain events taking place. I am not perfect though. Regardless a certain kind continues to let know as to what is happening to me and others and I feel that especially if they are telling truth that they do not deserve to be treated as second class citizens. <br>- I have noted teams in which are cleaning and changing things up in which has been equated to community service for some in a certain manner but for others no so. <br>- Interaction responses correlating what is taking place dimensionally in regards to ourselves behind the scenes and in front of the scenes.<br>- The lines being created here should be seen and understood and I feel that they are in a certain manner. It speaks of certain earth-based in which are not necessarily operating in the ways that are portrayed. <br>- I have noticed there to a be a thing going on in multiple infrastructures, Sports to be true for some of it but also other kinds in which I feel there is an emphasis in regards to Hollywood at times but I am unsure if some of the story lines and conversations are true. To be truth I feel it might be neighborhood related as well as there have been multiple tells about fame and Georgina in which have been a bit glaring at times.<br>- There was also tells that certain powerful were being put through the ringer and it continues to be let known that certain Good Spirit have traversed to certain ares but for myself and others the true good is always around. It&#39;s one thing I have started to understand and note. Movement of certain kind continues to happen though with more updates to older systems, like understanding that certain processes are not suppose to be attacked for certain kind but also ways of operating systems in certain kind not having to promote certain kinds of immorality.<br>- There have been different kinds of busts within the past week depicted on my end in multiple fashion. Today there have been multiple tells of certain kind situating different kinds of conflicts in which was depicted when I went into town, devastated energies in which might not be what it seems but might not be what some think either. I don&#39;t have to go outside to get this kind of support as has been seen within the weeks and years previous in multiple kinds of manners from content experiences being affected upon my presence, spiritual showing up in moments of need and continued clarifications in regards to how certain dimensional work as well as multiple times when there have been spotlights, mics and awareness within this process uncovered even in a daily sort of way. <br>- - Erratic ending with multiple stimuli of attack in which spoke of certain kind fighting and certain kinds of spirit dealing with different kinds of conflict taking place.<br><br>Informational Placement:<br>Time and Item safeguarding (AJH Daily Defensives Board - x290 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br>Gods and Clarifications (AJH Daily Defensives Board - x319 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br>Hollywood (AJH Daily Defensive Board - x319 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br>Inforia and Clarifications (AJH Daily Defensives Board - x319 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br>Family (AJH Daily Defensives Board - x388 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br>Regulars in regards to myself that my Main Spirit Guides indicated pertaining to Content Creation Shaping  (AJH Daily Defensives Board - x290 - Peacekeeperalex Trello Account)<br><br>The Regulars that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to myself and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) pertaining to Content Creation Shaping.
