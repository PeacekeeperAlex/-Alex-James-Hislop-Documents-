<div class="title">(22/11/2020) &quot;Relics Of The Past Going By The Wayside&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Dream: There had been a dream that I recalled. It was brilliant for the kind of sporting and recreational as well as activities to keep spirits high and make a certain kind of point stand. It&#39;s a subtle though and done in a manner decent. Working on recreational Sports in well organized manner that did remind of Olympics that could lend strength and unity especially for when the Olympics came up. It was like a knew there was a zoom in on a <br><br>Activity:<br>Pinkish delight for the bygones being cast aside for saving prime. Instead of this piece meal bullshit hanging around and harassing the rich as well as the middle class let alone the poor. They were trying to save though but I kind of thought to half imagine the other kinds of reasonings for the small antic blocks of stealing. Supposed need be life utilizers and the lame reasonings not working from some trying to encroach upon those garnering lifeworks and formworks. Build your own god damn fame. I wanted to hang with my own spiritual and create content worth living. The real truth as to what it was that I had wanted was for my own spiritual that consented was to take lead on this process in certain manners and facilitate other cultural to degree acceptable. Somehow that seemed too much for some but I didn&#39;t really care what they thought. It wasn&#39;t too much. It was normal. It was more normal than what some of them said was normal and I had logical stats on my side. Why wouldn&#39;t it be a normality for one to want to hang out with ones own spiritual. Most on this planet consider that to be a normality. It was the kind of spiritual that spiritualists spoke of on this planet for a portion but it was also the kind of spirituality that was spoken of throughout a larger percentage of All That Is. Love was famous. It wasn&#39;t just love though. Compassion, Care, Kindness and Enlightenment were famous too but so was the other kinds of words associated with what those Spiritualists spoke of daily. Light was Famous on this planet for a reason. I had wondered why light green was associated with healing prowess. The green infamy was actually good in the kind of play your part bad guy for theatrical purposes in local attire. Earth was moral. <br><br>Before going to bed there was a let know of green, mind and mentality as well as a certain kind of battle regarding certain ways of proceeding in this process but also other kinds as well. I had wondered later on in the day if there was <br><br>Movement of certain aspects of this process again noted, the under water one in what felt to be other dimensional a couple days ago. This one seemed air related but I did see a metaphorical of a strong man drag me off towards the cupboard near my feet. Reminded of a lanky old man trying to move me earlier and having banner interplay at the same time making things more difficult. Really it reminded of paramedics dealing with an irregular situations where multiple variables needing to back off at times. More intimate atmospherics of a room with what seemed to be smaller amount of people.<br><br>There had been more cultural around me that reminded of when I was younger. A moment of eating birthday cake kind of turned into a rememberance of past memories from what I could tell, it was done in a fashion where impressional and characteristics of my family but it was like a different dimensional area, somehow related to physicals in a certain manner, reminded of certain kind holding it down fro physicals but I don&#39;t know for certain. There was this reminder of family. There was certain kind that also reminded of certain kinds of handlers and backers, money horses and things of that nature. I had wondered the comment about the small side of the pool with pit fighters and passing of information as well as showing what exactly had been happening in regards to certain areas when around me. It was other dimensional and spiritual in regards to physical I feel that were around in proximity but also interaction that I was noting as a psychic medium. It was also certain spiritual in a bit of a rat race trimmed down a bit significantly in a running for a certain kind of claim. Some of them reminded of certain groups for some that were pro me doing advocational in a certain sense, although I have reservation as to how some of them truly feel and there were those that looked around and said either way but given what has been seen I had wondered if it wasn&#39;t too much of a thing for some to accept, especially given history of records. For some of them again, a certain West Culture making it&#39;s presence be known. This remembrance though was almost like a tell of preparation for some but also a let know that some did care. It was done in a manner that scared me to a certain degree to remember certain other dimensional happenings when I was younger to be true in which might not be fully true. There was multiple parties and the kind of good day feng shui from the spirit this day was amazing, awesome, brilliant, stellar and even radical in the kind of decency upon my birthday even if I did kind of go the route of trying to give back on my birthday. I realized the importance of birthdays and cherish that exists, the privilege of washing a wok, the care about dinners and how sometimes the card is mightier than the cash. Even small things like enjoying potential shopping wish list hopefuls, the delight in planning future gifts for family and friends, rescuing a sign hoped to be upon again in summer in which thanks all frontline heroes and heroes in blue and tan manner. Salvation Army fashionable stationary to be true.<br><br>Going through soothsaying was a delight in reading some of the cards, even instructions and a synergy about certain kinds that the reading could pertain. <br><br>The Original Creator lending towards smaller interactions in ways in which can help without large impact, ripple effect and interaction woes. <br><br>I thought it to be understood that updates regarding life processes and my life process in how my Main Spirit Guides operated was often times in regards to what was agreed upon updates in agreeance with other guideships. A spiritual holding it down for a certain physical in my process in what has been classically seen for the good to be updates and news as to what went on in certain processes. Has this been though always for good? Has the news always reflected as such? Hasn&#39;t there been understandings as to what one wants to experience? What about those left in the cold regarding information that was incorrect in holding it down for a certain people and spiritual within certain processes. What would be the opportunities from my kind of morality?<br><br>There has been some sort of gambit and setup having had happen in this process for what some have been trying portray. There had been a moment earlier near my Home back door where a spiritual had said to get ready. Might have been not in regards to me but I still displayed what my Main Spirit Guides relayed. There was then another kind supposedly &#39;setting it up&#39; in what looked like some sort of showdown. There was this kind insinuation about something taking plac, considering some of my writings and experiences not that shocking of a surprise to be true but honesty speaks of another tactic trying to hold onto a certain direction of this process even with myself and others still facilitating similar directions, it was kind of difference in morality promotion and even while understanding ethical that was an interesting contrast. I didn&#39;t know if it had to do with saving for I knew things would change if given my kind morality direction specifically when some go opposite directions in making it more difficult to save. For example if a perception changes that my morality has more of hold on this direction as it already does but reflects in perception, all of sudden that saving variable of certain kind saying they are using this process for such changes to be made more difficult because of either because of incompetency or deliberate manuevering. Why does this happen? This was also a part of the reasoning as to why some were still trying to hang on to this process, it would be good for me to be able to say that wont be a problem and I can do so in confident manner. Dont mistaken though, there were those posing as Ri and Right, pretending that this was about saving in multiple manners, which also made it more difficult for those that believed in that kind of direction in which although respected and cared for by myself, still disagreed with by way of circumstance and desire. There was a variable that was changing and it had to do with movement and process setting as well as interaction in which was moving towards to vindicate that my process was more in control by my own kind of morality.

It also reminds of programming culture, sometimes reminding of gaming. <br><br>Themes:<br>#Birthday #Records #Multiplier #Wonder #Impact <br>#StabilityForBigManifestation #UpdatesAgreedUponBetweenGuideships<br>#TeachersAndJudges #Remember #Logic #MoodHappy </div>
