<div class="title">(04/28/2020) &quot;The Mellow Experience and the Religion of Weed&quot;</div>
<div class="content">What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.<br>-Zig Ziglar<br><br>Activity: <br>You see I have seen how some of the culture spiritual operate in a certain sense albeit without fully knowing of certain concepts seemingly as physicals human on Earth-Based who has attained psychic-mediumship within the past five years and also earlier on in both 2008 and even earlier when I was young aware and noted the ability to be able to sense aura colours, sparkles of light within a proximity of sense in which also looks differ in other dimensional, for one of the discerned seeing the features and understanding what is coming into contact spiritual. It&#39;s a sight but primarily a sense because of the translation that spiritual sense by way of that interaction in which at times has been seen to be karmically related but not always. This awareness level extended partially to the intelligence of the conversation, I ask a question during 2016 and bare minimum amongst rest upon just learning to write down psychictivty tells and the kinds of things to learn like that of emotions being existing and are considered to be a prime in a certain manner regarding dimensional perception percentages. By way of knowing certain variable understood along the way like how spiritual for many on this physical planet earth physically and other-dimensionally there are many spiritual channeling through at times and for near constantly. Just because you feel the channel without fully noting it through daily life doesn&#39;t mean spiritual haven&#39;t been behind the scenes in how other-dimensional science and magic exist pointing towards evolution and origins with mapping outs that exist of what explanations are reasoning but of course if there is a scientific community, coherency and honest direction and upon the interaction and societal discerned as a psychic in conversation at time about some of the themes and topics that would be spoken of not only through myself in communication with the spirit but the spirit in communication with me existent and noted. Daily Channelings open discerned in how if some could observe the channeling going on through physical and inflection of voice as well as facial expressions specifically once explained thoroughly that there are those that are able to manipulate expression within the spirit as is seen in exorcist cases and paranormal as well as the Near Death Experience Research and the Spiritual Transformative Research currently underway not only physically but spiritually as well as through dreams and visions but also through interaction of expression discerned not only spiritually but physically as well pointing towards anatomical existence of other-dimensional even through ones own self located in the True Good areas. It reminds of the nature of story to be true in how the way of life can be far reaching and expansive, you can have a Higher Dimensional Self who mirrors metaphorical upon the events regarding other selves and why not it be just and fair for what it is to be one of the ones considered a certain kind of prime. For what you consider yourself are but the innermost of ones own self to be a prime. <br><br>Love: Keep Swinging and love more often.<br>Peace: Rains. Away.<br>War: Come Again?<br>Best: All or Noth.<br>MythomyFive: We that my Main Spirit Guides indicated are advocating for what they indicated in the manners that they relayed the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>ForecastMe: Darker than most process at times in which is under control.<br>Forecast: Sunny as has been at times but not to say there hasn&#39;t been spiritual turbulence what is being experienced behind the scenes for a certain amount of the population in which for physicals extends beyond to other dimensional at times for the specifics that my Main Camp indicated.<br><br>Terminology and Importance of following terminologies:<br>SpiritualElderSocietyEarth-BasedPhysicalRealism<br>SpiritualElderSocietyEarth-BasedPhysicalWesternCiv<br>SpiritualElderCultureEarth-BasedPhysicalEthical<br>What are the primes of existence in experiencing life?<br>I know it from a physical human perspective in which can grasp a certain amount of intelligence that some would consider to be baselines upon experiencing life and there are some missing from certain perspectives in the advanced that can exist. Discerned multiple kinds of beings in proximity, vicinity and interaction as well as as that in which has been confirmed from spiritual communications regarding and that leaves the idea remainder that is to telling that the physical humans on this physical planet earth as well as the other kinds my Main Spirit Guides relayed for the portions of this writing that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Imagine the conversation about how we can live and the amount experienced by immediate selves consider what some consider to be and the kinds of actions measured to be small compared to a large percentage of what exists. Spiritual that can experience billions of day within one life in which is lived as well, creation of spiritual anatomy and mechanisms as well as energy placements, tangible upon some of the concepts like belief and faith as well as truth in which have energy signatures in which upon my understanding one of the keys regarding is sense in how life is experienced. Imagine living two bodies at once immediate in setup. Now that it is a certain way of life in which would be different to some and coming from a single consciousness in which at times has been put through the ringer by way of discerning that other dimensional stimuli, life being experienced and interaction and reactions of the storyline and events being played out and played out through me at times as well as certain groups that have been in vicinity and proximity for a bit now, some of which is process and processes specifics. You can see how there would be elders to such a way of life in which is sometimes in direct contact with how one truly feels to extent and furthest reaches that you would consider yourself to be in who you want to be given parameters obviously utilized in such analyzation and cross referencing for some, like the decision for some to remember what they have experienced and what one would choose in what they remember as well as those that live side by side by such a way of life direction. There are those that know and always knew, like being able to live those two lives at once in synergy and sync especially in line with what one chose to be considered to be one at times. Like you can have half aspect of self that don&#39;t remember certain particulars of what took place considering the kind of times frames spoken of specifically if going back the beginning and also still be in sync upon conversations especially certain matters that my Main Spirit Guides relayed. When looking upon the kinds of things experienced and different kinds of beauty and compared to simplicity beauty there is a synergy. The kind of small referencing I speak upon at times has classified certain kind of spiritual and sometimes seen with literal dimensional status and measurements but you can look at it from an energy perspective too, the literals of machinsisms in motion to keep things running but you can have a certain kind of spiritual that is considered smalls in regards to certain concepts. Someone who experiences life in a certain manner that is different must be juggling act of the sincere kind considering the kinds of decisions and ways of proceedings that exist. The different directions as well and consider there are those Good that feel from beginnings and earlier times that traverse to present time frames. Even the looks upon how some of the sorted out through life experiences and ways of dealing, cultural normalities can be seen from a small perspective, like one that doesn&#39;t experience too much in which of course impact spiritually should be noted. You see aspects of infrastructure in regards to experiencing, moments and ways of life in regards to certain kinds of beings considered to be smalls in how they proceed to be true and it can and does extend to what you find to be the core of your being and English utilization regarding that physical earth-based has been seen to be meant for more than it seems in which has been seen although the interaction between spiritual and physical upon the understood of the spiritual working through endeavors of physicals and other spiritual. Those choices of who we are matter. Who we consider ourselves to be and it&#39;s understood for those that wanted it understood. When does a holy man on the mountain pass by a process like this and what would the interaction be. For you see he is seen to not bring abound the bad even if he packs a punch. but ever loving surprise upon that in which has been told before for good reasoning of interaction probabilities that will happen and have happened. One hand shake changes the world but then there were always more than just one by wide margin. Covid-19 partially changed that. You have common event on the peripherals of understanding to enough large percent in which there is spiritually categories mapped out in regards to earth but the True Good is abound. There was a tell about about higher spiritual not only in regards to myself for at first thy mentioned a king and certain kinds of aspects of bad that was under fire but then they also insinuated my higher spirit was under attack as well by way of loved ones and some sort of point that there were many I cared about some of which I did not know of in this life. This was noted yesterday on yesterday, April 27th, 2020 and also today as well as in a certain fashion. I had wondered if there was a spiritual in regards to me that experienced some of the pain and suffering that had been insinuated and there is this blaze no shit kind of response that could classified as a non-response for to do not really spoken. I wondered if that spiritual was one of those ones that did agree and feel that most everyone if not everyone should able to experience what they want to experience cross referenced with the Main Spirit Guides information that my Main Spirit Guides relayed. At what point does the experiences garnered by way of some of the terrible not encroach upon how one feels and at what point is that utilized against in a wrong fashion especially upon those higher up above who want themselves to feel and operate a certain fashion in which truly has been different sometimes because of the scary things that have happened. You can one one hand, see a certain kind that exists partially by way of markers and certain kinds of experiences taking place to other selves to get them to not feel how they once did partially by way of pain and being scared for a portion and then you would have those that claim such a different stance taken by way of experience is truly how a certain kind of self feels. The utilization of Self Rights to then try and encroach upon who wants to be which really does lament upon the importance of incarnation and the separation of self doesn&#39;t it to many different degrees. You don&#39;t think the good have check pointed and put advanced things into play even in easing manner for those other selves to once again be reunited with themselves and aspects of self they consider. The answer is of course they have put things into play, a wide range of different amounts of resources and ways of proceeding and in a process like mine I had wondered what kind they would have specifically setup especially if I chose such a life as this willingly. Of course you have more natural segwaying apart as well in which is considered to be for what it is and portions of something different considered legitimate reasonings and truth upon some wanting to separate in higher spirit but also in other places as well in which Higher Spirit might frown upon for dang who we want to be but gosh dang upon the reasonings upon those higher up for want of what they can sense and chose upon direction and revelation sometimes in unison with the better life. I know there is probably some higher spirit and spirit in regards to me that disagreed either a long time ago or maybe as soon as recently upon the choices I have made especially upon continuing to pursue my life and continuing to do involved of what I have gotten myself involved for a portion and other kinds just happening however they might have. At what point does this working on ones life start to seem like jumping through hoops to save and the answer is that it is a part of it for some myself included even if the small in the room to be true. Working through accords and mediation is another aspects as such and do know that for those who can walk away at any given time that that choice is observed at times by aspects of self some of which still considered and spiritual considered not so anymore upon that decision to continue to work on ones life. Of course the biggest thing in the mix always in which upon lower down areas not even knowing it to be of truth and yet with the fact that the good can attach the ultra save and ultimate situating to what we cant to experience cross referenced with what we chose, in my instance, what my Main Spirit Guides cross referenced in regards to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in which points towards us being able to live the lives that we want too without having to do anything that we don&#39;t want to do. A look around with curious wonder about how that ever changed and disappeared to ab anything but that especially with way more support in the past in certain time frames compared to today. How is this line continuing to shrink? Chilling out is all well and good but if that line disappearing, what other kinds of lines are changing? At what pint does the doubie in your mouth explode upon the next lit session. At what point does it not matter upon the life within the joint and a decent percentage of Weed Smokers agree a baselines that says if they were to manifest some good smoking green and heck maybe different colours without anyone being literally harmed by way of smoking such substances than that would be what we want, in a baseline sort of way. Does the point and mentality of the Love and Peace in such a weed smoking culture in which happens to be a large percentage of Earth-Based, proof in the pudding kind of majic that lets know that there is still a percentage that continues to smoke while life existent seems to be? It might have something to do with the observations and waits upon situating such a variable and not to mention that actions attachment and then of course the scare of realism existence why not might as well smoke a bowl kind of culture. Upon the line of some higher up powerful spirit just situating and sending us a shipment every year of the good stuff sans the harm and that isn&#39;t to say that the natural doesn&#39;t have ways to protect itself upon the smoke as there is many different kinds of things employed spiritually to do just that, the fact though that the previous line has been encroached and considered unviable and the answer seems to be to continue to smoke has brought fourth a difficult variable. Some would say that if it we were talking spiritual in regards to some other dimensional variable then hail Mary speak of grace let the creation flow of what they wanted to be true to situate that variable spiritual to be wanted of one of the very least. Considering the kind of people that a portion of Weed Smokers are it would be no wonder that another culture existent throughout, the harder type story wonder of spiritual curious as to how that manifests which talks of more than wanting to be hard and the association of the high with such types. Sure there might be those realistic that says, dude, we just wanted to gt high and that might be the answer. But what if it is more and what if some said proudly they wanted it to be more with the kind of unthinkable and travesty that seems to exist in regards to event unfoldment and action taken place upon the spark of something as natural as the cave man getting warm in early days. Because we look at the reason for good man and good spirit for what has been said and done in situating spiritual harm through smoking and vaping as well as the other kinds and at what point do you not feel to live your life even if you don&#39;t want to harm. Doesn&#39;t one of those groups of such smoking culture remind of the green thumb and the hemp strings in fashion which speaks of care in an interest alongside the greenery that exists on this earth, sometimes of that don&#39;t worry be happy culture. Of course some of them do things to make up for such discretion even upon the ways of fixing the small terrible that how dare could we have ever done considering the spiritual of such a plant as weed. Because it speaks of the same thing that Bob Marley did at least on this spiritual planet earth. No amount he must have been bad because of the amount of good that he was was ever going to change the fact that he said similar things spiritually which never told of the lie that there might be worse but rather spoke of what he did, Peace and Love. Some say he was a prophet, another kind of Jesus more low key and not identified and identified at the same time. Jesus was similar in a certain sense in how I gauge just in a different time and I have this perception of Afghani weed being spoken with some Roman in an ancient circle thousands of years ago in the time of Jesus, one of the greatest questions of all was that did Jesus Christ smoke weed at least once throughout his life. It&#39;s interesting that those two are of that small way of living living with peace and love. And there is a lot perception impact power in on this physical earth to provide that truth for what they experienced in turn that some say the amount experienced doesn&#39;t always fall in line with small interaction way of life in which is wrong in a certain sense giving the kinds of life lived from the live physical perspective in regards to their physical life in which does extend to their spiritual lives in the manners that their Main Spirit Guides relayed. How could we not look towards the Pot smoking crowd, peace, mellow and love even if they do defend themselves spiritually behind the scenes to not crow beloved. It was this marking in what some of the spiritual have espoused in how normal society would look upon certain groups and how would he perception be. Even the act of smoking weed itself speaks of chill. At what point do I observe in this process regarding such an action do I digress. Shine the ever loving creed that speaks of Weed at times. At the core of what some said certain spirituality of those that smoke Weed daily attains and emits told of Peace, Love and Happiness. When you get down too it and can be seen from beginnings, middles and endings as well as simplistics upon an extension that says we want other to experience what they want too. If being sad makes you happy. Make you comfort. Makes you release, makes you experience what you want too experience then experience as such. Of course from necessary derived cross referencing Main Spiritual Guideship information by way of being safe. Some have labelled as such a certain kind of context of happy. That ever interesting line of how some view the world in an actions that causes sadness wanted to be expressed being labelled as happiness by way of experiencing what wants to experience in which there are multiple kinds of labels. But I am of that. I have called it happiness before and will again because want one wants to experiences is suppose to be predominately happy but it&#39;s not the only one but many on this earth would agree.<br><br>Themes:<br>#Weed #Love #Happiness #Joy #Care #Compassion #Reason #Intelligence #Sanity #Therapy #Cope #Unspoken #Silent #LookAround #TheBlast #SeenTheSmoke #SignTheCast </div>
