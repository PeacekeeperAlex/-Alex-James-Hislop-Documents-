<div class="title">(07/08/2020) &quot;What did the Light say?&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Myself and Others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) asked the Light what it wanted to say? I focused on a Wood Grain on my wall, but I gave my attention to the Light while it responded. There was a gravity upon. Segway to different kinds of Physicians of the past and speaking points again on certain ages of positivity dubbed as such for when I reference those four ages of positivity that had reminded of the walk into town early April. <br><br>On my walk into town there had been these energies on the lake, so super smooth and beautiful, some speaking of resources and riches wanting to jump in and snag like some taunting desire to lake succulent.<br><br>On the way to Newmarket I could feel those travel energies taking place, high speeds spiritually although with safeties in place in other-dimensional and the kicker was that I have felt these energies and I believe other physicals have felt these energies but fully don&#39;t note the spiritual and other-dimensional travel regarding. <br><br>I felt large energies shifting in New Market this day, it felt like an overlap was maneuvered. I could feel large long clean energies ad the walk of McDs to the Hospital was a certain kind therapy in reflection on a day of nature and sunshine. <br><br>I could feel again spiritual interaction from the sun itself on the way back. Kind of just kept my head down to a certain extent. Can you imagine a comedy sketch from certain spiritual from the Sun in which maneuvered the Sun in ways in which looked like he was doing a comedy bit on Solar Stage. It&#39;s the kinds of interactions I can note even with luminosity changes, energy discernment and literal visuals of actions from the Solar System Star. Some of it is a utilization of Entertainment and use of the Sun itself I feel but you can&#39;t expect people not to hope for positive interaction for the Sun and from the Sun. I think there is in great fashion and I feel there is endorsement of actions anyhow from the Sun in which portrays correctly. Religion of the Sun. *Talk about that*<br><br>I feel like the dimensional of memory have helped in many fashions and yeah some of it having with my physical memory. Some of them do Anti-Camp fashion and theme park nonsense in regards to my memory and others but it&#39;s still safe, quality of life and there is those who ant more realism but I still discern spiritually of memory helping and protecting, this shouldn&#39;t negate some of the darker things that I have discerned memory. <br><br>A kingdom of Heaven storyline that might be different than previous has been knocking at my door for the past couple days. Story safety has been spoken of and talked about in multiple manners these days. <br><br>Went for a walk. Went to the woods. <br><br>Message Avadar, Cut Grass, Read It, Work Tomorrow,  Go to the Movie Theatre,<br>Ride the Subway,  <br><br>Spiritual, other-dimensional and physical that is shaped in likeness of my family albeit in smaller manners. The real idea here though was in regards to certain kind at times that has been viewed in certain manners supporting role regarding those in which they have been shaped but especially those that were treated unfairly regarding certain kinds of shaping.<br>Another kind had to do with fans that wanted to help but in certain circumstances for some of them unable to fully help the way they had wanted. <br>Another kind had been those unfairly labelled in regards to certain actions pertaining to some of the shaping in which has shaped them.<br><br>There was moments where I felt there was groups rising up and because of how timeframes can work and how some play it in this house, it looked like defense teams situating past, present and future in certain timeframes during such rising ups against disparities. Some of this might have been Earth-Based related but there was something off about it. It wasn&#39;t on their end regarding this interaction but rather on my in regards to the interaction set regarding venting and anger energies coming around me. Not to mention the kind of spiritual distress happening to my body in some playing it a fashion similar to earlier on. It felt like aspects of process past were around me. This blue to me I have identified as classic good. <br><br>I am a fan of another blue, electric which reminds of certain kind of Friends and Family. There is also indigo blue in which some have been trying to slander as bad in a certain sense in which actually reminds of America in a certain manner. It&#39;s unfair for my process to take a certain kind of burden and what would free speech look like without being able to discuss events, banners and colours especially upon receiving certain distress upon similar colours and letting know about it. This was yesterday kind of look when <br><br>I think one of the debates has been style of play regarding time and the fairness and unfairness of different styles of play. <br><br>Recovery of certain spiritual support regarding shaping likeness and characteristics of others in certain sense and remembrance that they have their own live to live and they are more famous than some realize.<br><br>Upon trying to go to sleep upon feeling upset spiritually and other-dimensionally, I could feel like a sadness that kind of reminded me when I would visit my cousin and when I didn&#39;t want to see her or I was upset with some kind of aspect of our relationship. It also speaks of not being able to be with someone and wanting to be with someone, the crumple of the insides kind of feeling and soft suppression. They had spoken on how there was a certain spiritual potentially utilizing similar form. It was a tell that this might have less to do with Earth-Based to a certain extent at least in regards to this interaction. There was riff and I wanted to go to bed but of course I couldn&#39;t go to bed. There story moments and form utilization regarding certain people I have seen before, some of it I felt to be important but realization that a persons story is safeguarded in many ways especially upon story playing out in other processes.<br><br>A certain kind of group that hadn&#39;t been here before that is like a certain kind of cool and famous banner, a certain kind of blue banner that has reminded of disruptive and having bad experiences regarding was around and noted. This I have seen to be utilized in certain capacity at times, some would want me to say the utilization is in line with certain kinds of blame and disruptive but also a certain kind of saving. The thought that these are the good guys spurred an intense story moment in which throughout the day there had already been Story around in the wings protecting certain Earth-Based Characters especially Pennywise.<br><br>There was a good side to the setup of this night, just keep alex near a brick wall to get shit done and the plan had mentioned multiple times to stick to the plan and multiple pointing that it can&#39;t because of the disruptives regarding erratic, disruptive, anger, argumentatives, conversation and freak outs to a certain extent partially by way of certain legal heavily involved. I got angry though because some said that it did affect certain things and I got upset because of that and I thought some of the setup regarding is it was the fault to be fucking stupid. I vented throughout and we did identify certain realism groups regarding from previous reminding of certain bad experiences before. Some were pointing to the past saying that a decent amount of those moments might have been vent area but I don&#39;t want to hear later on that it was all a vent areas and that I can&#39;t prompt what needs to be prompted in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, regardless there is still a designated spiritual from my Main Spirit Guides that prompts exactly what I would have prompted while located physically on this planet earth for safety reasonings.  <br><br>The problem is that multiple kinds of blue was also talked about another of which reminded of a faded blue. There was tells that some were playing this process in a certain fashion inside my home, where it was less present emphasized this day and into the next day in which some were trying to situate certain moments in the past and potentially the future. There was vent area discussions because of the kind of erratic and disruptive going on regarding my end. I had pursued vent areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides relayed.
