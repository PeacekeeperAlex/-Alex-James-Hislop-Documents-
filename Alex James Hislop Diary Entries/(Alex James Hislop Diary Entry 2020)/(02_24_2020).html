<div class="title">(02/24/2020)</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br><br>- (Yesterday after watching some wrestling I had segwayed to creating certain disclaimers. WWE disclaimers. I had got sidetracked and ended up looking for the America disclaimers I had created earlier and even printed out. I ended up re-uploading upon not being able to find them even though there is other disclaimers and advocations located online in which can cover and I could have sworn I already uploaded such disclaimers but either ended up uploading the ones I had on my digital desktop in the physical. There had been a thing about spiritual online in regards to my Alex James Hislop Documents Folder on my desktop in which for a portion is good and decent. Multiple points, thoughts and energy placements were done by myself and others in protecting upon putting such disclaimers online. I ended up watching two films afterwards in which I had been wanting to watch for a bit now. Story lines regarding media discernment especially historical were noted in archetype themes throughout the first one and the second one I noted themes of Civil Rights and Content Experiences. The kinds of energies experienced and interaction experienced through the first movie made it feel to be as if there were overlaps from the 70s and 60s around as well as potentially a certain interaction overlap. I could see one of the characters to be researching certain kinds of leads in reference to certain kind of real world events and the other dealing with the artists vision in which was also in regards to historical events. There is such a thing in regards to referencing dialogue pertaining to certain kinds of events seen within movie. Historical Overlaps, and Media overlaps regarding current events and past events, sometimes that kind of things makes it into the film in varying styles as to how that works. Clarifications. I noted a certain kind of character interaction of the characters chasing stories, it&#39;s one of those films which highlights some of the best of Media and certain Media Archetypes in which is understood through film depiction of real events. There was this idea that some were trying to shoehorn some of my personal and bringing up potential events that happened in the time frames of filing and time frames of event depiction in which upon the people spoken about at times in insinuation are truly innocent in my actions and non-actions, just as much so as the regular person on earth who has nothing to do with it in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Interactions reflecting the tense situations on my end in watching such a film at least in what was depicted to me upon psychictivity gauge in what was happening on the screen, spiritual communication and insinuation in regards to what was happening on screen whether it be on my end or not. It turned into this really strange interaction at what point like the eyes of the world were watching me and not necessarily only in regards to this time frame but some of this is facilitation of psychictivity and certain kinds of machinisms for a portion in regards to emulation. )<br>- (In regards to the second movie watched and watched the rest of it today, there was a moment where certain spiritual was discerned a spirit of detective and Justice as well as legal upon certain kinds of things showing up upon movies. That this concept is very much real and alive in regards to Earth-Based film making is truth. There was something about the second movie watched in which potentially let know of this and I am not certain if there was an update about this kind of reality because some were trying to insinuate that it was when it first emerged in which was then corrected and discerned to have existed for a long time. It made me wonder about some of the things that have been insinuated to be happening to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to some of the film making and media located on Earth-Based. I surmise that it&#39;s done in a certain fashion and some of the stuff if not more so is understood to be for what it happens to be. Maybe there has been that sort of thin where justice has been served. What myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated are choosing in regards to Punishment as well as other kinds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated really does matter. The styles of filming to be able to facilitate interaction and reaction that is just as good as the real moments captured on film pertaining to media and events can be facilitated in just as good fashion if not better while still keeping in line the real events and media happenings as well as other kinds pertaining to film, in which there are many ideas and have been many ideas in ways to be able to facilitate this even in including some of these overlapping of film in a certain fashion. The Light says this is achievable in multiple kinds of ways in which reminds of the interaction. Think of the possibilities and how the previous ways of filming can still be utilized as well as facilitated especially in ways that the brimstone and immoral would find to be decent while still fitting the criteria of what those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated relayed.)<br>- (Still multiple kinds of events taking place and discerned with forming up happening, battle and mediation discerned. Some of it having to do with Earth-Based good.)<br>- (One of the things observed and let known happen to be about a certain kind within frameworks having to do with my life and a facilitation regarding moments within my life and a life timeline facilitation in the form of what looks to be prison) </div>
