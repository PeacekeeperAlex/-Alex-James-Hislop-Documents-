<div class="content">Quote: <br>Worldly fame is but a breath of wind that blows now this way, and now that, and changes name as it changes direction.     <br>- Dante Alighieri<br><br>Thought: Never again is not as close as you think.<br><br>Activity: <br>Fame seems to have real energies associated that I can feel as a psychic medium. When you are on a stage or in a stadium there is certain kinds of energies that Artist&#39;s can recognize. The amount of physical watching the endeavors of certain kind sometimes lend towards a live that exists in which has a current sometimes. It feels like glowing energy this live in which can feel like living energy. There is also platform awareness that exist in which can feel like you are on a stage. Stadium like energies where it feels like there is multiple kinds of spiritual watching a process. I have noted these energies without having to be on a physical stage. Voice works that sound like there is a mic attached to my voice spiritually. Walking down the street and feeling like the setting is some sort of set and smooth energies of moving upwards. I have been able to differentiate between certain moments where spotlight are on me, beams of light and energies like certain spiritual are watching me. Where there are spiritual cameras rolling behind the scenes. There are moments where it doesn&#39;t feel that way but also the let know by way of energy discernment and spiritual communication in regards to the idea that just because you don&#39;t feel those energies doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t taking place because I would feel at times a certain suppression of psychictivity in being able to sense that to the point where I could still discern those energies but almost as if a blanket of cover overlapped. There are multiple kinds of colour associations with Fame but one of the big ones at least on this planet happens to be Yellow-Golden Light. It&#39;s interesting that many would note that colour in association with certain afterlife and how much of an impact it has had on Earth-Based Fame. Though I would note all kinds of colour in regards to famous throughout some of my experiences. What kinds of regular everyday people are walking around without fully noting the kind of spiritual fame that they have attained throughout life? The fact that some of us our kings in other dimensional has been noted. Leaders and artists. Working people as well too in which doesn&#39;t negate some of the Fame that some of us have. Does it have to do with the reality and idea that most of us are famous anyhow. Does it truly have to do with the extraordinary that some of us have lived? For a portion yes, but there is a larger portion that exist upon the miracle of existence. A God that points out that he loves us regardless of our fame level that does extend to the beginning. He spoke about something back then. It was told that he would always love us no matter what. That he would protect us and it was instilled on such a level as to understand that in a baseline way. How would God describe his kind if another was to emerge. Would it be if another kind was to emerge beyond what we think is All That Is to point out the kind of people we are. On one hand we would have a God let know in a certain context but I kind of feel that humility would be emphasized. That we are also regular people and spirit in a certain manner but that some of us have lived extraordinary lives. In which when you look past some of the things associated reveals that portion are regular but that it is that regular in which is coveted nonetheless. Smiles from a certain group up above, some of them as famous as they are in which have looked upon regular lives with wonder and awe, maybe a bit of jealousy from some of them. The tip of the iceberg is revealed in regards to some of the Movie stars interaction in regards to some of the Media on this physical and spiritually planet and the real true is that some of them would near approach such actions given context but rather goes to a level of sadness, despairs and soul tired. How is it we would ask as to why any kind would feel the way they do? The amount of moments passing does a number as to the reason why and for a portion there is that understanding that that is the reason. But not all of them. Wouldn&#39;t have there been a time of recharge when our own batteries wouldn&#39;t be so depleted as to make us say that a certain kind would never emerge again. Like in beginning when a break would be had and we wouldn&#39;t see a certain kind for a certain amount. How far down the line in what some consider the beginning did it finally happen when some would say that they need a break. Unthinkable manifested finally. The reality of certain events would change our batteries eventually. How would that change the interaction of Good that would never traverse upon those lines that would emerge later. Where do they go anyhow? This Middle-Earth mentality of leaving such places. Sleep? Eternal? Are there truly some who have left that would sleep slumber forever? Will we ever see that list again that my Main Spirit Guides indicated? You contrast it with that List that some say some of us will never see again, the ultra good that God safeguarded in the beginning when a certain variable would present itself. How many times have we lived to see that variable present itself. The eternal heartbreak and sadness. How is it that I can&#39;t even muster enough sadness to cover a pede, it speaks of suppression not of truth.  Is there really a kind in heaven that we can never see again upon promoting certain kinds of actions? How many under the Cover of incarnation and memory fog in not being able to remember have stepped on those some of those lines. How is it that the response afterwards was that for some of us we already traversed passed some of those lines. <br><br>- (Discerned certain spiritual influences trying to utilize certain kinds of actions from myself in a certain manner. There is Good and Bad utilization at times, some of which has been in regards to my Untitled Learning to Love book in which I feel some have been taking out of context and some trying to utilize in a manner in which is prophetic and that some of the scenario listings as how God-Realization would impact society to be full truth. Some of it to have it have happen but also some of it to be utilized in a way in which is not decent especially if it doesn&#39;t have happen. This isn&#39;t just in regards to myself but also other kinds of people as well. )<br>- (Hectic energies when trying to proceed in regards to social media interaction and also a spirit both in which I perceive to not necessarily be in my best interest, a spirit that utilized my life at times and wants me to move out, also on the topic at times of me not necessarily doing anything wrong in which has been causing difficulties in regards to the reasonings that certain spirit are around me. Even past some of the excuses if I was still arguing and doing certain actions, there still isn&#39;t a certain kind of valid reasoning partially by way of me wanting to be places where my Main Spriit Guides indicated and my communications set the way my Main Spriit Guides indicated. There was another spirit trying to invoke energies of turbulence, hectic and disruption within my physical family in which also corresponds with what I am doing not being a problematic, even with creating defensives video and things of that nature.)<br>- (Yesterday there was spirit invoking argumentatives at the end of the day, with heightened energies and things of that nature in which I discerned some realizing that the way I am proceeding is problematic in regards to certain kinds of blame.
