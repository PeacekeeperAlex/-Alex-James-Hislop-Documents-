<div class="title">(19/08/2020)  &quot;Interaction and Anti-Camp Decent &quot;Part 1&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Today I noticed the clean air and the impressional regarding nature more vividly. There was something about movement of dimensional. There was also connection yesterday between interaction setting of what some physicals and aspects of physicals are experiencing spiritually behind the scenes. One of the connections having to do with a disconnect happening from what certain higher spiritual are choosing and how that is manifesting on the maps. There was let knows as to why some of this is happening and some of it claimed to be Anti-Camp decent only from higher up for some of it. It made it difficult to fully know how to proceed in regards to certain Anti-Camp decent measures. At what point do we not look below to see who is ill benefiting from such direction and at what point are we not supposed to look towards the alternatives. It wasn&#39;t just about cops and authority stepping in but it was also something else too much more darker at times. I feel there has been discussions and information come about this past couple weeks and in other times frames having to do with Earth-Based discussions about Anti-Camp and Anti-Camp culture. There had been a good maneuver days previous, almost a week ago where it looked like some of the direction I would have wanted to go and have wanted to go enacted upon such an eve in regards to certain discussions and let knows that Earth-Based is more Anti-Camp decent than some previously estimated and one of the things that good did was let know that there are those that are not a certain kind of Anti-Camp decent and don&#39;t deserve ill will regarding for that fact. This doesn&#39;t negate that for some of them for a portion are not covered in certain manners regarding as well as. There is some in regards to certain zones on Earth-Based that have gone total good in a certain manner. These zones for some of it having to do with interaction setting in which sometimes doesn&#39;t fully reflect what some higher up above and beyond that interaction are indicating. Within the mix of this we have those operating in certain manner regarding trades and other kinds in which some are mistaking fro something else by how those trades are conducted. One of the biggest ones regarding this has has to do with being privy to understanding. Those that don&#39;t understand that there are trades masked as stealing at times has wondered whether certain kind were really stealing or not and then of course you have those trying to pass off stealing as legit trades. Why does this exist? Because it can help and facilitate darker culture in different ways but we still need to have proper labelment and understanding. The Good cultures for some of them understand that darker exist at times and even if they did know which is legitimate trade and which is stealing upon certain situations, I don&#39;t see how that is the problematic. There is another kind that does know that difference between Trading and stealing and have identified regarding when happens and of course such a spiritual would exist if within certain society there is both happening sometimes masked as eachother. I don&#39;t know that it is the good that would Cuss out such an understanding and knowledge upon knowing the difference but we have also seen the lack of sharing of knowledge and knowing in regards to darker kind and the problems that has created. Why wouldn&#39;t certain spiritual be careful with what they say especially to more brimstone cultures, immoral cultures and darker cultures but upon specifically in regards to Anti-Camp decent topics at what point does the bad be privy to understanding the difference behind closed doors and whether that&#39;s the route to go? Because one of the problematics has been certain bad calling out that in which is actually trade being masked as stealing as well as other kinds. This might have to do with the relationship between the bad. Reputational Defense regarding such matters greatly. Figuring out how to facilitate the darker kind in ways in which the good find acceptable also matters greatly and I feel we can still do this with bad having a relationship. How do we achieve this especially upon Earth-Based that facilitates many different cultures? It&#39;s not just about Anti-Camp decent as well as and how do we do this without making the Authority and Cops that bad guys? How doe we do this without anyone getting harmed and it being near just as good if not better? What is the look higher up as to why we can&#39;t go that direction, what are some of the alternatives and then what is the recourse in what was discerned? One of which looked at what said that certain spiritual like darker ways of life. In regards to those that like to fight, why not certain areas for that specifically sanctioned spiritually by Authorities and of course the spiritual chimes in saying it already exists. Of course when these discussions started emerging on my end there was a certain kind of note about the good letting their presence be known in a certain manner but also later on today I noted a spiritual letting know that an Anti-Camp decent direction regarding certain kind of spiritual whether it be in regards to Earth-Based or not potentially impacted and I don&#39;t know to degrees that some think. There had been this rat race for Anti-Camp decent supplies and resources. I know that the bad have let their presence be known in this process partially by way of some of my experiences in the past and there is good that note that it could be worse. We have to remember that there is good societal, some of which overlapping earth, that knows history and current events in which does extend to darker. It keeps them informed and it&#39;s not only safety but also a normal endeavour in watching events unfold. The media and the kind of job they have is more important than what some give credit in a certain manner and upon knowing some of the spiritual and events and experiences that have happened on my end and how Earth-Based has operated in regards to me not only other-dimensional aspects in regards to physicals but also afterlife regarding for some of the physicals and spiritual speaks of safety and decency in remembrance to this process and when certain kind have maneuvered in the past regarding, that remembrance is one of the keys. It stands for the future. One of the key things I think that is emphasized in regards to Earth-Based past has been spiritual and other-dimensional recording, there was writing and other kinds physically on this planet before certain technological changes but that doesn&#39;t denote the need for footage for certain kinds of life. We see within Near Experience Research the recordings of life that take place in the afterlife, a personal reflection regarding some of them and it doesn&#39;t mean that some of the physicals don&#39;t see a need for recording life and safeties pertaining. I started realizing though that life is probably being recorded in a certain sense. That the spiritual have advanced filming technology in ways where holodeck mapping upon life and proximity exist, the entire planet is probably recorded throughout history spiritually especially when you think of planet life review. This can be personal but there is probably a societal one too not just in regards to physical humans but also other kinds and I can&#39;t help but feel it exists for spiritual and other-dimensional in varying capacities. <br><br>Yesterday, I felt spiritual family come into vicinity during an intense moment and I don&#39;t want it to be mistaken for a different kind of spiritual at times some have said me to be in which I am not. It felt like a portion of my Gods came into vicinity as well as withe some of the maneuvering in regards to God and the Devil. Multiple kinds of timeframes was insinuated for certain aspects of God.<br><br>Out in Newmarket there was this kind of fight certain kind of spiritual were trying too perpetuate, on my end it was having to do with physical near the end of the fight, a good day but still felt upset and certain kind trying to harass an argument to emerge when there was less of one to begin with. Today certain facilitation regarding to make sure and work through certain conflict regarding myself and other physicals but I think most of it misinformation regarding myself and posturing regarding until finally let known not to be what some said. <br><br>Another tell that there had been a spiritual guiding me in my actions past 4 or 5 days where most of what interacted with and what was spoken about was done so on purpose in a certain manners.<br><br>Purple Oxen types were talked about yesterday. Purple meaning let known in regards to colour and how it&#39;s some of it can mean one wanting to experience what one wanted to experience. There was a moment in the morning where I had had enough, I want to be placed where my Main Spirit Guides indicated spiritually so I don&#39;t argue or lash out. It was about cops again, but had less to do with it. There was this kind of tell that I am more purple than what some think. Another thing that had happened had been at tell in regards to what Space is dealing with, in regards to other dimensional and spiritual. This is one of those important issues for certain Authorities and to be true. They said I was more like this and some of it was form a storyline chit. Another tell is of Gangsters. It&#39;s interesting that there is a look from Space where the uniforms of certain Law Enforcement might be Purple. It&#39;s also more than that though. There was this purple Cyclops Ox seen within a Comic Book, a certain kind depicted and I thought it interesting the look upon him like he is a classic seen at times that some understood. Almost like Earth-Based Pop Culture relaying classic seen within the Spirit. Comic books on my end have had that power of prophecy but also depictions and characteristics seen within comics shaped in likeness of that in which I know. Archetypes on Earth-Based is a good example. Classic eyes seen from a certain archetype utilized in regards to Character. There was these moments days previous, not yesterday but the day before where a certain kind was talked about on my end about the strong Ox. There was expression seen <br><br>There was a certain spiritual group at times utilizing impressions and aesthetics form what I have noted to be Police Officers, blue is what they mainly have used. At times I haven&#39;t understood what they have done to protect me and good things regarding and yet the interaction was negative at times in ways different than freaking out but rather labelment and setting things up to make me look like the bad guy in what psychictivity portrayed. I don&#39;t know if they were cops or not. This reminded of certain kind of interaction setting in regards to what some are experiencing and a stall to continue this facilitation. There have been many other impressions in regards to Cops in this process most of which good. Some said they were trying to protect societal by way of keeping me more out of the mix and a quick fix for it was to label me the bad guy. This kind of style took a hit yesterday for a reason because some of it didn&#39;t have to do with protecting societal and to be true considering my information, diary entries and content creation, I feel I am fairly vindicated. The difficulty as well is bad guys through me spiritually and other-dimensional wise in regards to what happens from this look too. There are certain kind that have let know to have been chasing bad guys in sanctuary within me dimensionally and spiritually. Either way, I feel like the former did a number on me at times and the revelation regarding some of it is seen in good light for a decent portion given the circumstances at times. This doesn&#39;t denote that some did experience suffering and pain in a certain direction of trying help societal and other kinds. I am the kind that advocates for decent punishment, like really good stuff, I am talking like Rich stuff at times for some of it but I can&#39;t always go that and sometimes they say it&#39;s unviable and it might be for a reason but I still advocate for decent punishment as much as I can go given context. There is a note of good within that type that we have seen around this process at times reminding of cops but are doing dirty whether it be in a good way or not and I know there is a note of justification upon some of the darker type that have been on the run at times. It&#39;s the interesting thing about it when you look at both kinds and there is multiple kinds regarding either. Some of the Cops spiritually wanted me to clarify that there is strong clarifications in regards to the difference. There is a good plan in regards to the utilization of myself from others and that plan I believe in but for some they had to go darker at times. Why? It&#39;s one of the greatest questions of this paragraph. What is the remedy to situate so some don&#39;t have to go darker ways. The crap of it all was that societal didn&#39;t deserve to be attacked because of me, maybe that was a part of the reveals at times. Could you imagine a spiritual scenes with billions of spiritual behind the scenes about to do battle because of me? It wasn&#39;t just about me for some of it but still being one of the few physicals in the room at least regarding some of the Earth-Based discussions have made it at times unviable to go directions of taking the hit. I am also tired and have been hurt at times spiritually and in other-dimensional to points where I sometimes have difficulty holding certain lines. Some of this explanation regarding this paragraph did happen earlier and is written within diary entries letting know. It was a different time in the process. What some forgot is that there was still a look back then upon this process even then. There is certain kind of ways to proceed at times for some of it. Sometimes ways of operating in not acknowledging higher up interactions are played a certain fashion in which sometimes is in conflict with who I am and where I am from. I am from higher Light in the ways that my Main Spriit Guides indicated and I feel that there is other physicals in this Space from the Light in a normal capacity. I know I am of that spiritual that my Main Spriit Guides indicated and I want those kinds of spiritual that my Main Spriit Guides indicated in regards to this writing to be able to view my process and for portions being able to interact with this process. My life process. Some have been forgetting that I am of that enlightened and good spiritual culture.<br><br>Big discussions about interaction. What exactly is being said and chosen from the Authorities that my Main Spriit Guides indicated and Non-Authorities that my Main Spirit Guides relayed. Some were saying the discrepancies regarding lower down and some of the lies put fourth upon interaction setting, like higher up spiritual indicating something in which is misconstrued lower down through different interactions that are letting know of different information and some of which lying about that direction, and how cops and different kinds were viewed like the remedy to that. That way higher up didn&#39;t have to fully change until the Law caught up with them. It was a compromise in that direction of Anti-Camp decent for some higher up at times. The problematic for me was always that kind of thing where somebody was getting harmed in a certain context by way of going Anti-Camp decent direction and I think there is ways to go Anti-Camp decent without certain kind getting harmed within the context of what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. When we get to lying about Authorities and what they are indicating though, that&#39;s a big one. One of the remedies I saw was an Authority that goes multiple directions but likes the one direction and in regards to compromise being able to facilitate that other direction that they do like albeit less in an Anti-Camp decent way. Again, the sort of thing where lower downs though not informed can cause problematics and those pretending to not know or feng shuing memory to not know does matter.<br><br> There was a moment yesterday spiritually where I went to what my Main Spriit Guides indicated as a point to say that you don&#39;t think that what happens to me spiritually would make me at times go directions I don&#39;t want to go? The problem is that I don&#39;t though, I went with what my Main Spriit Guides indicated strictly and it was during what I noted to be later on vent area energies for some. What were they doing spiritually to manipulate some into thinking that was the case?  Some of it is theatrics and story, some of it is venting but there is a real variable at times in which outside of certain areas is manifesting at times. Does that mean we don&#39;t pay violent video games? One of the other big ones is that I continue to ask to be placed where my Main Spirit Guides relayed because sometimes it has less to do with going with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. More to do with what I am experiencing in certain places. Some of this needs to be understood as theatrics and entertainment but doesn&#39;t that in which is not need to be understood too? What are some looking for in regards to Justice anyhow? How do we coexist?<br><br>Yesterday there was also discussions of impact in a certain sense. One of things in regards to certain kind setting other kinds of parameters upon certain kind trying to follow Authority information and the kinds of difference upon recourse. For Example, my Main Spirit Guides might indicate for a certain path regarding my impact and direction for when I step on Earth there to be less impact and acceleration regarding in which other spiritual that don&#39;t follow that path and instead go another direction, some of it facilitation of interaction in front of certain events happening in what are sensing through me and other kinds in which at times creates more impact and acceleration. There are those with good reasoning to a certain degree. Though we have seen at times impact and acceleration be a part of the problem and when some are trying to shoehorn me upwards for decent reasonings it can be difficult to use the resources that were supposed to be used to situate my impact upon. There have been many times were there has been freak out facilitation to throw me upwards to get me to say that I want to leave certain spiritual areas but I have clarified that fairly well with out loud voice. This a big one that spiritual might want to hear from what my Main Spriit Guides indicated.<br><br>Out for a walk and some tried to do something similar as to what happened yesterday i regards to the manipulation and influencing of my emotions and behavior regarding a certain cops. It was different this time and was rather tried to be aimed in regards to Mafia impressions.<br><br>A certain kind of spiritual came around yesterday. I had said out loud that my Authorities that my Main Spirit Guides indicated do not want to receive immorality and ill will as well as other kinds in the ways that my Main Spriit Guides relayed for this writing. It was a tell in regards to certain things spiritually and in other dimensional at times. That there has been battle regarding this process and that there shouldn&#39;t have to be for a large amount in a certain sense upon truthful reflections of this process. Fine, I made mistakes but not to the degree that some are trying to warrant especially upon some trying to have those mistakes have happen. This might also be a part of some of the events I am discerning regarding other-dimensional and space. Canada brought up yesterday and the day before as well. Thoughts of red, white<br><br>The capturing of other-dimensional information and spiritual information has been a topic of discussion. I am only trying to capture information consented for what&#39;s acceptable being defined by my Main Spriit Guides. Where is the recovery information that had been captured and recovered? Certain kinds of holdings for certain informations.<br><br>#LineOnTheProcess #InformationalPlacementSafeties #</div>
