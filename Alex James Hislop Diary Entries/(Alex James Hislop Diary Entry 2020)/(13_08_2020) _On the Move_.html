<div class="title">(13/08/2020) &quot;On the Move&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Take a note on the process and the kinds of interaction happening upon the escape from Alcatraz Moments of my life, I saw good and noting Good to be in existence and the knowing that there were spiritual forces both good and bad manipulating my life at times was known and listed and even those who have read back on these diary entries will note some of the darker side spoke of in the kinds of experiences I have listed and the interactions regarding the Spiritual Realm. The Great Escape is sometimes Constant in Motion and I would note powerful Non-Interactions to take place. Time spent doing nothing provided the Answer to my unspoken dreams. Saved for the Many that remember and know the story to be true. I literally felt like somehow the discussions and remembrance of Ingen and the other kinds of contract groups that exist alongside the hearing from the Anti-Camp in a capacity in which comes off for one is going for has made it seem like there wasn&#39;t connection, when many did take a look at the other sides of Truth. Scribes and Contracts. Literature and History were and are grounding points and basis in which Compass provides evident. The Life Utilization regarding those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated matter greatly and understanding some of the lines of utilization upon and of life is one of the Rights Activism I wanted to set out and do. Yesterday, one of the Greatest Ideas came over to me, said to create galleries and Artwork regarding the Gaming stuff I have been doing the past couple years especially regarding the Total War Series. I imagined a space of web design sleek and slim, access to Google Photos with Albums of some of the spiritual moments that existed in Gaming. Later on it seamed that it was a success with what I am trying to convey. Meaning within experiences witnessed. The Google Album looked beautiful. It gave me inspiration in another one I wanted to create. The search for saving beautiful cartoon form and spiritual was at times met with apprehension but also adulation and Brilliance. I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with creating a Gallery of Beautiful Artwork in depiction. Somehow the back and fourth kind of movement didn&#39;t seem to work as much as what it was before upon pursuing some of the actions in the pursuit of providing Canvas Gallery infrastructure and overlaps of spiritual as well as other-dimensional upon such artwork and process. Consent in what one wants to experience consulted daily that it seemed to have been an installment of creed. A Seeping and Instillment fusion for certain spiritual. I played A Total War Saga Troy and it brought back spiritual and I felt spiritual emergence and interaction on my end in many different manners related to Mythology told on this Earth regarding the Greeks and Romans but also other kinds as well too. It was interesting to see interactions regarding this process and what it felt to understand gaming releases on this planet but also the historical regarding events and lives pertaining. It was almost like witnessing the utilization of such heroes in our pop culture in the manners that some would expect upon if there was conflict against in which we couldn&#39;t deny that there weren&#39;t e that kind of gravitation upon some of the heroes of realm but it was also in regards to Villains at times too in wouldn&#39;t there be a depiction of the bad guys if there was any to be true. I felt myself call upon portions of myself in certain moments in the struggle tug of war regarding life utilization, many moments where some use theatrics and aesthetics. I don&#39;t now how to fully let know in the kinds of Fair I have experienced and it is the Beauty of it but it was also more than that. The storylines from earlier on such a day as this one where force was spoken about in many manners. Use it well was preached. Continue movement upwards and continual use and spiritual interaction at times discerned negative on really what seemed to be a positive kind of backbone even if there was movement because of Authority. Multiple moments calling upon my Authority and clarifications throughout the day and in fact a better use of the advocations at times within the past couple days than previous weeks but still in line with laid back chill in what I have been trying to go fourth which makes sense upon the living life and the a bit of the outcry upon some of the interaction setting upon me and the impact regarding so side earlier on for calling upon my highest self authority.  The stopping of being able to go Contract groups and venture types has been a part of the problematic not only for myself but the others as well sometimes in descript through my writings in other-dimensional and spiritual. Another one has been saying things are not societally decent and stealing regarding resources regardless of whether they are mine or not. One thing I identified was some trying to work on why it is that I shouldn&#39;t go to other dimensional and spiritual setting in defense of myself but also in capacities in which have to do with conversation, entertainment and process management. Different kinds of maneuvering regarding those lines of doors and wardens and at times to what it has arrived at in certain places it&#39;s interesting to see the kind that have emerged because upon my process family and personal are big factors regarding my life process. Work is another and it exists in two-fold dreams at times not to forget another one darker which I would rather not be writing about at times considering the anguish and grief. Dimensional interaction in which do remind there is still conflict taking place in the safe moments of experience seemingly that one has discerned. Maitre D&#39; movement at the Cafe bars and story lines of understanding. They matter is what some said but another days previous had been process overhead and processes in front of the scenes to ones own process as well as and the coordination spoken of at length. There was another storyline more personal days previous but some said throughout these three days in which myself and other many have done things to try and help situations. It&#39;s why up top never had a chance. It&#39;s why when Logical applied makes for a knowledge of direction upon a kind that is not supposed to be getting attacked spiritually or otherwise in the manners intended. The Son and Father storylines making their emergence continual even seen from a battle and war traditional perspective and spoken of advanced technology and themes regarding. God Cultural emergence witnessed and understood to be in intermingle with future and advanced culture, at least regarding the interaction on my end for portions.</div>
