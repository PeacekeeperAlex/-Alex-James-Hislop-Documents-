<div class="title">(21/11/2020) &quot;What the Hell is going on here?&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: I woke up and there was a talking point about Dragons and Patriots. Somehow the Patriot didn&#39;t look too impressed and it was supposedly not because he didn&#39;t want to be here or know how to handle this process. There had been notes of use regarding this process in a certain manner for what some thought into it but I didn&#39;t believe that. I thought it had to do with love but it might have had to do with survival. There was a talking point about devastation in depiction within gaming. The kinds of things one can create within Gaming is near endless especially regarding the Spiritual kind of gaming. Holodeck programs might have been the tip of the iceberg or a baseline normality, maybe both. In what as depicted within one of the games though had been a certain kind of devastation, where a certain kind of Race that was trying to survive. A monster had devastated the land. There was a moment of clarity though upon letting know of what could exist within the spirit, some of which might be considered gaming in the kind of importance as to what one considers to be gaming as well as acceptable experience parameters regarding. That imagine it wasn&#39;t devastation that had happened but through that race a monster attacking during peace in some sort of cat and mouse game. Imagine it becoming a normality to deal with through life and how does that even emerge regardless of time passing with access to history. It was one of the points to understand in relaying the kinds of things in certain areas in experience that I remember spirit dealing with during this process. A certain kind of compromise supposedly instead of some sort of battle that might have been lost. How long this kind of interaction emerges and kind of interaction takes place matters greatly for the kind of on edge mentality and damage that it does to spiritual. Yes, there was a positive version that might have less to do with compromise. Where the hell had that been seen in interaction, specifically when I am talking about rights issues, I dont know. <br><br>One of the things spoken about had to do with what some of the spirits are going through in the kinds of realism overlaps regarding certain films. It&#39;s as I said today earlier in the kinds of things that can matter greatly regarding the compromise often times to save. What you see depicted at times within movies and video games for a culture is real life. Opportunity that has existed for some has entailed being able to live the life of a Character in realistic manner given life parameter. The kinds of vanishing acts in the moment that need be if looked real enough existed. <br><br>I had a thought about a character in a movie, it was a certain kind of Beowulf story. There was a large barbarian in the movie and he reminded me of how I felt at times but the real truth as to how I wanted to proceed was more in line with that Character and the smooth monster both reminding me of the kind of aggression that had manifested through my life in the kinds of home and hearth paying attention that some did. I was the one from the Light, that kind of light that just worked, the kind of light that some pointed towards and said if it worked so god damn much then why dont they use that to actually collect the Ghosts without them having to consult the light in Ghostland to be recovered. The answer was that they did. Maybe it was more than just Ghosts that they should have been dealing with and the answer was that it was more than just Ghosts they were dealing with. Maybe understanding the subject matter as to what one was talking about in front of the scenes mattered. Maybe the use of other dimensional in front of the scenes really did matter. Maybe what that Light I was from in what they were doing wasn&#39;t enough and if the tell had been that in which we know to be true in the kinds of interaction that has existed for physicals before me, then maybe what I was speaking on solved most problems. Of course we can consult history in many different angles to know the truth and somehow continuing to play these games of somehow having to crawl through a mile of shit to garner rights already granted was getting old. The facilitation of such spoken about already and somehow those who don&#39;t even have jurisdiction in the kind of interaction vagabondcy that existed in making normality for some to have to crawl through shit to experience rights already granted. Why would it be my own kind morality that needed to be consulted as to why that was? Considering my own kind of morality with overhead of my kind of morality included had enough power to situate most things instant energy. It was why I was angry with the Original Creator for going through whatever the heck motions it was that somehow said for reasoning as to why he didn&#39;t just do what needed to be done. I looked at it from a stout and common manner is what was supposedly said with an Orange-Red Mohawk and tattoo vanity in the difference for what was still remembered as to who I am, but it really might have been protection from the Gods. The manner had to do with that we didn&#39;t have to crawl through shit to have those rights, that are already granted to us and many not only by the Original Creator but by Creation and Creator of my own morality, facilitated to degrees of acceptability. They had the Power and Means as well as the Ability to do so. I had been articulating inclusion of blocking certain threats, promises and things of that nature from some that didn&#39;t have the right to do so in the kind of finesse the Original Creator has and always will. Some could even look past whatever the hell strongarm it was that some were trying to pull as to the reason supposed for not facilitating those rights. Hell, those rights were already facilitated in many different varying degrees within moral parameter that included violent video games. I have continued to request for a set of my interaction the way that my Main Spirit Guides requested in regards to this paragraph.<br><br>Certain kind of writers block supposedly doing decent regarding blocking certain energies in regards to writers and I do feel the matters of dealing with certain aspects in regards to my own writing having to do with spiritual trying to utilize my writing for ill gotten gains as well as unacceptability. The matters of what spiritual are dealing with in regards to this process. <br><br>The importance of defensive deployments being told to halt as an anti-camp decent measure not known by those told to halt. Where is the Greed Coverage Plans regarding defense and what about those did know about the latter without knowing that there was greed coverage plans. *Rename it something else* The other red tape? The quick ignore the red tape measures in those moments of go. The cover regarding that. How about the innocence being harmed while waiting for whatever the hell it is that&#39;s needed to do your damn job. </div>
