<div class="title">(03/07/2020) &quot;The Pinnacles&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Deployed an event framework in regards to needing to be scrubbed in which throughout looked to be something in which some at times might not take seriously but also some in which do, there seemed to be an interplay happening as to how i should react and what I should do with an emphasis that it might be connected to past events as well. Some were using such events and happenings at times to white wash things that had happened and to suppress certain kind. Creating more problems and there is the potential that some were trying to smoke and mirrors in utilizing such a tactic. It was understood though later on that Good kind of Claeaners were around, truly moral types in which take these things seriously. <br><br>While playing a certain video game content and recording there were certain spiritual attacks that took place especially in regards to my lung areas in which would be healed upon waking up in the morning after going to bed and even feeling healing happening beforehand. There should be an understanding s to what happened to the spiritual regarding those systems and what their quality of life is. In the mix has been those trying to change, augment and move certain anatomy, some in which is not suppose to be moved. There was a noting in regards to me being placed in a certai  k k kn area in which some were letting know that it was also a facilitation area for a portion but the psychic stimuli experienced regarding still let me know that there were attacks taking place and the kinds of stuff that would happen during and after I turned the content video I would find to be unacceptable for a portion. Do not mistaken the fact that a certain kind came over ot my area spiritually and tried to influence a certain direction and tried to attack regarding. Even if my outburst is the cause of some of the problematics it is still not good enough to blame and utilize to attack myself and the real truth is that you don&#39;t want to use what happened between 6pm, March 6th, 2020 to 8am, March 7th, 2020 against me in which there was an emphasis in regards to remembrance and the things that took place. Battle happened and I could feel certain power bad that my Main Spriit Guides indicated being done. There were multiple things over with this night and I responded by way of prompting what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There was emphasis in regards to the proceedings that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and the points are remembered that were being suppressed and I did feel to have a certain kind of support even through some of the turbulent events that took place in which emphasized a knowledge of remembrance and non-blame on my end by way of not doing anything wrong in the middle <br><br>- Movement of me and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated dimensionally to the areas that my Main Spriit Guides indicated, for some of us insinuations of downwards was let known. Especially upon being in a decent higher up area beforehand in which felt to be safer. The idea of suppressing knowledge and sight in regards to certain events upon a previous area emphasized over safety for a portion of spiritual. <br><br>- The utilization of making things grimier in the context of anatomy and dimensional mechanisms and machinisms being made to seem compromised to invoke a scrubbing procedure. One in which they said this was a famous happening within my process and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, almost like a certain kind of event framework deployed. The spiritual have viewed events at times is as if there has been certain kind of replay not only from oneself in regards to certain events but also that certain spiritutilized events beforehand as well too. There was look towards how i operate in regards to proceeding with my life and some were trying to build a line in regards to myself by way of my awareness that somehow I should not associate with certain things in regards to this scrubbing event realization. In which classically I have operated upon living my life regardless of certain spiritual and that isn&#39;t to say I don&#39;t care but at what point in which I do see those the point of those who have greater awareness in the spiritual live <br><br>- Lungs attacked and I could infrastructure targeted, pain and damage in regards to certain lung areas that would near completely in the morning. Some said this was a certain kind of weapon deployed in regards to breathing and again some trying to make it worse by suggesting over and over again in regards to going outside in which for a portion has been proven to be some trying to make things worse while in the mix are those trying to help and suggest real ways to try and solve some of the harm and ailments presenting. Within my process I have seen the dimensional feng shui in regards to my house and not days previous cleared the house in certain manners in which realization that I don&#39;t have too has been noted throughout the past five years in multiple kinds of manners upon feeling dimensional stimuli that lets know that they can maneuver me outside my house in certain ways, even in large dimensional sort of manners. This speaks and lets me now that they can situate certain dimensional obstacles and the fact that there was this problem inside the house indicates that there is ways to solve the problems in the house aseptically that in which has been seen upon going to bed in regards to healing as well as those that situated those trying to perpetuate certain maneuvering of resources, allpersonal and incarnate fellows away from my person. It spoke of a tactic that some were trying to pull my lungs downwards and how this process is changing and moving upwards and how some did not like that happening but one in which is proceeding regardless. Myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides should be placed dimensionally where my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this writing the way my Main Spriit Guides indicated. Especially if some are unable to traverse and situate certain dimensional situations without me going outside. It&#39;s interesting that the proof regarding that we that my Main Spriit Guides indicated can be placed dimensionally near instantaneously where my main Spirit Guides relayed in regards to this writing is that some of the same in which speaks that they can resolve the dimensional situations within my home not only form outside my home but inside my home near instantaneously as well. <br><br>- I felt there was attack commencing and some trying pull me in the direction of being involved in regards to certain battle that was unfolding outside. Involving me is one thing but involving the other physicals on this planet is another thing entirely. With that being said, I don&#39;t feel it was warranted to bring me into such a situations even if I did end up helping. It was a pinnacle of my life in which a certain facilitation took place. I feel my physical family was protected and they should be considering they are innocent in conflict regarding such matters. The real truth is that I feel certain kinds of bad spirit that my Main Spirit Guides relayed fucked up this night and the utilization as a smoke and mirrors to cover the fact that at times there has been attack within certain processes doesn&#39;t seem to have worked but rather backfired and stacking upon for a certain portion. Do understand I am not trying to have happen for true but rather letting know of what I discerned. That there was attack and battle taking place on such a scale that has not been to this degree often at least in regards to interaction tells on my end. That means something right, because there has been let know of battle in many capacities but this was something different. Again I call upon those that my Main Spriit Guides indicated with the knowledge that some are trying to utilize me calling upon certain kind in pinnacle live moments of my life. It&#39;s near the the top of my list in a certain capacity in regards to moments seen and understood. Did this reach earth based? What were the events that had happened on earth-based regarding March 7th 2020 and March 6th, 2020. There was already potentially tells of early event firings yesterday but if to such a degree of battle has been happening at times regarding than at what point are we watching a certain kind proceeding with such events. What is the real truth in regards to these events especially within the context seen as early event firings. I want to emphasis that I went with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated, the Main Spirit Guides that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light and the those that my Main Spriit Guides in the Original Setting approved. I felt like vanquishing the foe that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light and I request what my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding.
