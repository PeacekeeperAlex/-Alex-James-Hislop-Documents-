<div class="content">Quote:<br>Sleep Perchance to Dream<br>- William Shakespeare<br><br>Thought: <br>Change and Deliverance are another answer.<br><br>Activity:<br>The dreams we experience in life quite possibly be real in a certain sense. I have experience hard dreams where the stimuli feels similar to experiencing waking life. Where psychictivity and sense are feng shued similarly telling me that there psychictivity set in some of these dreams. Even said to move certain spiritual mechanics from my waking physical to the dream itself. I have felt emotions and abilities within dreams at times. I have felt conversation and metaphoricals spoken about after the dream where spiritual communication and the tone of the conversation has let know that some of the dreams experience is spiritual trying to tell us something. There are multiple kinds of dreams, subconscious and self dreams in which are facilitated by self with the little help of friends as well as others. There is ones with spiritual communication with family and those that have passed on. Different dimensional existences involved within dreams as well although I feel there is ones in which some would point towards as classics pertaining to physical and other dimensional dreaming. I have woken up from dreams and felt that I am still in interaction within the dreams itself. Where I could still feel abilities being utilized behind the scenes like in an other dimensional self and allpersonal sort of way. As if I am still experiencing some of the stimuli regarding. This might not always be other-dimensional self related but some of it might be other dimensional selves and either way the experiences shared matters greatly. I still consider to be an aspect of allpersonal in the sense that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. It makes one ask what exactly we are experiencing within these dreams especially if we are experiencing other dimensional stimuli from these dreams. Who are we in contact with in regards to some of these dream and what is the quality of life regarding certain beings of dream. There have been tells that some of dream land has been lost and that they need direction at least in regards to some of the darker places but I wonder if there is not a good place that is good kind of lost. Where good things happen upon those being lost in such a place. It makes sense that being found would give reason and closure as well as good life regardless of where some came from. Either way it&#39;s good to know that in a place such a dreamland where life does exist that there is hope and prosperity. I wonder about the different kinds of dreams and visions and how they correlate with one another. I have though of the Light and the different kinds of interaction we can potentially have. There have been accounts of people seeing beautiful light within their dreams which makes me feel that that might be similar to an NDE in a certain kind of way. Getting a glimpse of certain kinds of afterlife through dreamwork. Some of the classic scenarios of dreams like falling or going to school naked and even dying in your dream might hold more meaning that what some think. The falling motion I have felt as a psychic medium and it kind of feels like certain spirit falling into body but sometimes it might other dimensional selves combining with physical and maybe even allpersonal. I can&#39;t begin to fully understand the dream of being naked at school or work in regards to some of the more enlightened version because something screams out to me that certain spirit might be saving by way of creating embarrassment in regards to oneself while dreaming. It&#39;s been seen and explained through my Diary Entries some of the darker kind and how sacrifice, Entertainment, Stunts and Lunacy can save certain kind in darker situations. Maybe it might be a higher spirit pulling a prank for all I know but somehow I feel the key lies within Freudian research and the Jungian types. It speaks of subconscious at times and the meaning is archetypal classic at least on Earth-Based.  The last one is scarier for obvious reasonings. That you could be killed in a dream brings memories of a quote from a tense movie and that some wouldn&#39;t apologize for such actions speaks of the kind of departure that has happened of certain eras but then again another kind says that we are mending. We can look towards everyday society to see how things have shaped in the reality of Earth that we have gotten better. That morality has been instilled within the past 300 years in which has at times overlooked that the regular citizen in certain nations of Earth-Based Physical past and Earth-Based Spiritual Past have been moral. But it&#39;s sometimes forgotten how much of a rapid change we have been through even compared to generations ago. Some things seemingly lost and obscure like the chivalry of the 40s but things gained like the civil rights movement. Demeanor and attitude reflecting a small gleam of what the darker side sometimes laugh with but the soul&#39;s understanding of Sexuality, Colour and Gender emerging from a place of remembrance. The Basic Human Right being recognized for a more modern approach even if not as gentile as those that fought for our liberties and freedoms in which in understanding the spiritual would make one see how even the bad guy depictions of some of either side might have been both incorrect and correct. One asks how the dreamworld sleeps while being awake. Cause it can feel like there is a disconnect in such places with some of realities of the outside world but maybe it is not so. The more know than we think and if a physical could ask with his out loud voice what nations were involved in WWII or even WWI, we might get a crystal clear answer listing of physicals nations and spiritual nations involved. Some of them might have been involved in such happenings. It wasn&#39;t just physical but it was spiritual as well. It&#39;s not just those wars but other kinds too. When those answer were told it made sense of the clarity that exists in certain portion of dreamland. There was always a clarity that was present and yet a certain kind of fog made it difficult to articulate. I would wonder what the Sandman of Dreaming thought of such events to be true. I know such a being to exist and there are probably others in which exist too. There is a realism in regards to dreaming as has been seen by multiple kinds of dreams where it looks to be a directed film at times. There is story involved in which links that kind of certain dream existences by way of the amount of large abstract dreams that have existed and the kinds of interactions taking place but it&#39;s almost like a shadow of story presence. I am wondering if there is a metaphor. It&#39;s interesting that I see a certain presence of story and realism in communication contact with spiritual guideship and those that have passed on in many different ways.<br><br><br>(- Shadows of aftermath in regards to some of the battles waged and battles still waging upon a certain event was said to have happened during the switch over of 2019 and 2020. I could feel myself heightened areas and large voice work upon doing certain kinds of Daily Advocation content which captured a certain portion on physical recording. There was thing about certain recording in regards to years switching over. )<br>( - One thing that&#39;s been on my mind has to do with those that in which view certain things by way of utilization and other kinds in which reminds how certain physical live on this earth based have viewed things in the past and still do pertaining to some of the knowledge and awareness as well as lack thereof. Has to do with not focusing on certain kinds of happenings spiritually in which is a benefit but also a detriment. I don&#39;t mean to offend and on the other side I have those trying to analyze and focus on resources givings, revelations, prophecy and updates upon certain kind of year end and year beginning. I am looking for my balance in the thick of it, still noting certain happenings while not putting too much emphasis on such events in the areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicted. I still care about such a perception and I feel it should be safeguarded but to the degree partially corresponds with what those physicals on earth based felt especially in regards to the Human Population. )<br>-( Music continued to be brought up about expression vs Non=Expression. It&#39;s one of the storylines that has existed through human history in a certain context and on some ends it might have to do with certain event in the 20s coming up. There was talk of resources and the kinds of happenings that seems to be taking place a separation of Music industry in which might be a depiction on my end to make things worse. Either way I have noticed something similar whether it be depiction or not in regards to certain spiritual communities on earth based spiritually in regards to physical earth-based.)<br>-( Smooth energies around even with some of the turbulence out there happening. It&#39;s made me wonder who exactly is receiving that kinds of turbulence and what I am experiencing in other dimensional as well as what other are experiencing in other dimensional. )<br>- (Large mix put on me upon trying to go to bed in which looked to be that some of the revelation as to what was happening in certain places and how I proceeded throughout the day happened to provide the kind of reasonings that some had hoped for certain actions taking place. )<br>- (There was movement to even higher energies than what is usually normal in this process or at least currently and supposedly in which one of the lamentings is the kind of mic equipment attached even when unawares. There seems to be a let know of the kind of Awareness on this process at times but also a creation of further Fame partially to try and take things from this process upon the reveal that I am not as Famous as some think but also a utilization of fame to try and further make difficulties in this process and others that my Main Spriit Guides indicated.)<br><br>Dream: <br>It was like I was walking through certain rooms, there was an outside at night. A man who was said to be really good at the game was there. He was actually one of the Master Manipulators. he looked upon one woman who survived in a certain of a group of survivors in a certain, mild interest mixed with indifference. There was elements of zombies throughout in which I feel was another dream. In the Past couple days I had noted a scary moment where I saw dinosaurs in a dream sort of way somehow. There was an overlap of what I have discerned on certain earth-based murderers, the one in which I have associated most at times or at least discerned is that of light orange of immorality with smooth impressions. This was somewhat separate to the dream where we were moving from room to room with some sort of mind games happening and people dropping dead. The clock fell on the floor and the glass and frame were off but the number stuck to the floor with the clock hand telling the time. I could feel hard dream and other dimensional in which reminded of Jeepers Creepers. Like I was running quickly and it was discerned bad things were taking place. All three dreams were nightmares in a certain sens being experienced at the same time. It&#39;s been insinuated that other dimensional selves and allpersonal experiencing portions of those dreams like the zombies aspects and that for some the dreams looked different. I couldn&#39;t discern who was killing certain people in the dream where there were mind games. Something to do with their bodies being on the ground afterwards. Certain kinds of attempts to try and make it out or survive. The hard dream one behind the scenes felt like I was psychological influenced in which some were saying I was venting but another kind of tell was also that of the Immoral impressions smooth energies which were said to be of that in which has been depicted as content experiences that I have associated with air but there was also water impressions as well. I woke up and I was afraid, they had brought something to forefront and it was frightening. A reality set in in which reminded that there were those that were some of the dreams I had seen and that some situations were dire. <br><br>Mantra:<br>#Positive #Care #Compassion #Kindness #Happiness #Wonder #Magic #Brilliant #Fantastic #Charming #Classic #Creative #Courageous #Chivalry #Cool #Clean #Cheery #Beautiful #Dazzling #Divine #Effective #Elegant #Ecstatic #Electrifying #Energetic #Ethical #Exquisite #Efficient #Fair #Fabulous #Free #Friendly #Funny #Healing #Honest #Heavenly #Ideal #Imaginative #Independent #Innovative #Instantaneous #Intuitive #Inventive #Jovial #Jubilant #Joy #Legendary #Lucid #Lucky #Lovely #Light #Lively #Marvelous #Meaningful #Merit #Miraculous #Natural #Novel #Nice #Nurturing #Phenomenal #Paradise #Resources #Supplies #Amenities #Support #Pretty #Prominent #Proud #Perfect #Progress #Prosperity #Protected #Truth #Honesty #Poised #Quiet #Quality #Quick #Refined #Reassuring #Robust #Rewarding #Restored #Resounding #Reliable #Remarkable #Respected #Reward #Reasonings #Rejoice #Right #Left  #Skillful #Sunny $Success #Spiritual #Stunning #Special #Soulful #Simple #Secure #Safe #Super #Stupendous #Spirited #Sparkling #Smiles #Rainbows #Gold #Stars #Whimsical #Tranquil #Terrific #Thrilling #Tops #Transformative  #Thriving #Trusting #Valued #Victorious #Wealthy #Sponsors #Elite #Worthy #Vital #Vigorous #Willing #Wow #Restored #Love #Armor #Choice #Consent #SubjectMatterSafety<br><br>Themes: <br>#Music #Soothsaying #Nightmares #Dreams #Spiritual #Intimacy #Defense #Resolutions #New #NewYear #Arrival #Change #Breaks #Gaming #Hope #Awareness <br></div>
