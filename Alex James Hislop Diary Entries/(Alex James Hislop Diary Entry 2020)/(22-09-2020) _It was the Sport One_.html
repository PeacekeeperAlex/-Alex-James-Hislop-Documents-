<div class="title">(22-09-2020) &quot;It was the Sport One&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>So this morning this interactional of Good Spiritual and other kind emerging in different fashion even though less coherent on my end I could still discern Good in vicinity and it reminded of earlier tells upon the potential of bad taking place within the past four or five days but really the past couple weeks rang within my mind as I type this. I knew there was battle taking place at times. I knew that there was potential that not all of it was good. That there was spiritual under duress didn&#39;t seem to be a question but rather an observation. <br><br>I realized some of my colours in a certain moment where I felt a spirit of Story come around me and even the channeling reflected a different side of myself. I knew there was culture of story in which existed where you put a hat on and that is your hat. Where you respect those colours you dawn. I realized I was Red and Black and the more we looked at it, the more it made sense and for some it already made sense. I saw that I was angry and felt that more was needed to be done more so than classic orange at times at least in certain areas hence red. I knew that I felt more extreme then classic brown at least in certain areas hence black. There was a story tell about some of this obviously. The Clown. It contrasted and spoke of the Clown and the symbolism pennywise the dancing clown. There had been story within this process already in regards to such and I have tried to protect regularly by letting know that pennywise is good for a large portion and that there is a lot of morality in the spiritual pertaining and have been given proof as such at times. I feel I helped the story. I had looked at my father and he reminded of Orange at times and my Mother reminded me of a dark purple puce. It also reminded of another story regarding Wizards. I thought it interesting that it would be Black and Red upon me in regards to such a storyline. There was a Fatal tell about White. Whether it was that I had the power of white through Red and Black or that White had my back, I thought both. I ruffled some feathers in a Comedic fashion in which made black laugh at times regarding a portion. I pulled a fast one in my writing. I thought it genius that my father the Comic and my Mother who might been Funnier and though so too in the Joker pertaining to the Green, White and Purple discerned. Zero the First is what some said. I didn&#39;t know if they dug this story as much as I thought it to be fascinating and Truth betolds. My family can shape their own story for a large portion of it if they desired obviously Guideships discretion. I think what needed to be understood at times on the eve of understanding is that myself and some of my family are physicals on this physical planet earth. Where we for some of us are in interaction regarding multiple different kinds of spiritual. So when I say that we have other colours in certain capacity it wasn&#39;t to step on the toes of those that liked many of us to respect certain styles of dawning specific colours in certain moments. The brilliance of many physicals on this physical planet earth is that it could match those kinds of styles of living and styles of play in which the latter can be included in the former in certain ways. It was almost like if I reached in the direction of a certain person after Belle and Mr. Bogart that somehow I needed to reach other members of my physical family and spiritual family. There was certain aspects that were already reached and understood. This interaction of this story emergence specific at times upon me when I was wearing story related blanket after figuring out some of the meaning and the fact that I was of Black and Red even if there were other colours and that this clownish acts from myself was not necessarily oblivious to certain things taking place around but rather a certain kind of living my life through the madness partially because I am living my life in which doesn&#39;t have to denote me being psychic. That brown was the chosen one seemed to be evident. The black and red a bit more extreme at times both below and brown the responsible <br><br>Multi Colour and specific colour were on the fritz. There was friction and need for alleviation and maybe and unwinding to be true. I was of both. My Heart held in many Colour to be true but also Heart Desire spoke of singular colours at times and coloured me a specific colour at times but also logic dictated a portion of that direction pertaining to single colour dawning more separate away from multi colour. As a physical it was difficult to fully be able to facilitate that direction with my out loud voice due to dimensional circumstances.<br><br>I still understood that the good was winning.<br><br>There is a story in regards to Sports at times. Someone speaking through Sports at times. There was key variables that I identified in which was probably already identified in certain manner. Variables to another Global Game on this planet immensely popular spiritually. There was potentially more than one.<br><br>Ice Hockey - Live (Live Energies on the Ice)<br>Basketball - Space (Classic Space Interactions with Basketball)<br>European Football  - Crowd (All hail some of the best Crowds)<br>American Football - Elite (Enough said)<br>Baseball - Time (A lot of time for American Past Time)<br><br>Then the refs might have been identified  by way of other sports on this planet for a portion.<br><br>Lacrosse - Technical (I discerned Maintenance and Utility but also Technical)<br>Rugby - Tough (One of the toughest on this Planet)<br>Olympics - Pinnacle (obviously)<br>Badmington and Tennis - Agressional Finesse (They said I might have missed the mark on this one but it still works)<br>Cricket - loved (This might have been another one but it also made sense with the above)<br><br>It matched. Some of it a bit off the marker on my end supposedly for what some said but it was close and I was near reaching in revelation of the idea that some of these characteristics utilized to create a global sport on earth. I thought of continents. Certain Areas on each continent serving as the setting. This was the Earth one but there was other out there and in which Earth was potentially a part of in certain manners.  There was one more thought I felt was missing. What was the game? We had certain variables told through sports that speaks of sports but was it open ended obviously in regards to what the Earth-Based Authorities that my Main Spirit Guides relayed indicated. I thought of Total War. A certain video game series by Creative Assembly and SEGA on this physical planet earth. It was a winner. The real truth is that it was Battle Sports that spoke. How battle could be set like Gangs of New York style or even Medieval Setting but there was also the realism of modern technology in which being able to set it up in ways without anyone being harmed already accomplished out there to a certain extent existent. In discerning Earth Sports, reminded me of UFC and WWE and where did they fit in? WWE was the platform for the story each match at times for some of the matches speaking as such. It was the thematic. Boxing to me felt like it was gambling but serious gambling but it was more than too. Maybe it was serious. It was a big one that still had the respect of the past and what fit would it be in this kind of discernment to recognize that it still had the respect it deserved. I didn&#39;t have the answer for this one. I had went to the spirit that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and wanted certain spiritual listed that my Main Spirit Guides indicated to consult the Fans and Countries that consented in regards to what they felt about each sport on this planet earth physically that they wanted to talk about but specifically in garnering what some of the other variables to this might be. There was another that ones care about in this country in many fashion that i had felt I had neglected by way of not paying attention especially when there was Toronto Team regarding in the CFL. To me it spoke of Logic, white Logic. The other variable in regards to boxing I feel was the UFC and I am not crazy in thinking that there was migration from Boxing to UFC in which I do feel cordial. UFC to me felt serious. Again one of the tones. But it might have been more than that too I feel there was another one to identify regarding both. I felt Sports Media to be a part of this. I think they were suppose to be who they are especially if were talking spiritual but also physical in certain sense. I think if we had televised battle sports without anyone getting harmed near as good as the real thing that there would be sports writers on this planet interested. Gladitorial speaking and spoke of popularity but also situating prime. Not a neglect in Training but rather Gladiators experiencing quality of life. We felt to have wanted them situated. This truly extended at times for how we felt regarding Sports Stardom. It&#39;s a Natural. It&#39;s a sports terminology.<br><br>The spiritual that came around me early morning reminded me that spiritual still cared about this process. I felt the previous around me did too in certain manners as had been seen with past interactions within 2 or 3 days as well as. Spiritually speaking it might have been different situations though at times with things I didn&#39;t and that&#39;s not just in regards to the past couple days but really my entire life. <br><br>Psychictivity<br>Events<br>Channel and Communication<br>Story (If there is ever a problem in regards ot my writing, I can always turn to story in Non-Concept pertaining to looking at certain aspects of Earth-Based and other kinds in discerning metaphorical, synchronicity, Meaning and Story regarding.<br><br>Caying (the opposite of Decay in the sense of Decay meaning Deterioration, I am not necessarily saying ok in regards to certain things that my Guideship did not indicated for me to say Ok towards, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides)<br>Recaying<br>Decaying<br><br>A bit of Caying a day keeps the Decay away.<br><br>The physical Human Appendix Anatomical linked to Intestines might have more to do with Psychictivity than previously thought. Maybe spiritual transportation as well as, I am not fully certain.<br><br><br>Woke up in the morning after a strange kind of dream, it was like my family was in proximity and there was these moments of swirly activity, in the dream it was like it was normal, like somehow certain kind of activities that some might ask a question about in understanding some of the substance might not have been cake. Maybe it was a tell of turning but I feel it might have been the ruse of thinking that I am less anti-camp decent than some think. Maybe like it was forgotten as strange as that is on the standoff hold up memory way too far bullshit of some of the past couple days. Literal memory manipulation discerned regarding certain spiritual in vicinity and proximity as well as the other kinds in which a percentage of decent and good in the mix partially protecting memory and manipulators of memory makes me ease up in judgement at times. <br><br>Either way I woke and everything was fine but it was like there was a spiritual wanted to shake my hand, I could discern spiritual visual overlap regarding and I did a shake hand movement but then an iron grip took hold of my right arm and squeezed, I could feel some of the spiritual compress and after reflection I did note the decent of such a move, the cleaning of the right arm for one but also the saving of certain spiritual regarding the right arm that some are viewing at times not as it actually is partially because some can only do much. Does this have to do with access to technology? Maybe. It&#39;s also sometimes a compromise for some in certain areas but not always and on my end as a physical there has been misunderstanding regarding certain cultures in discernment. I discerned mech culture to be true but which one in pin point has been less of a problem on my end. They do remind of the vacum style vent area kind of culture at times but different. Vent area culture predominately reminds of cleaning while the mech kind of culture reminds of deconstruction but also certain kind of battle culture too. The real truth is that it might have more to do with cleaning than I realize or maybe healing as well too and in understanding that it&#39;s more than all three to be true at times for some is realistic. Realism, a certain kind is reminded of them. The colour brown has reminded of some of this culture just as clear white and silver has reminded of Vent Technology and some tried to insinuate that maybe brown were more natural oriented as well as because of the kinds of colour utilization at times. When my arm felt crushed I kind of flipped out a bit and lost my cool and it&#39;s not an excuse when I say that I go strictly with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding my actions as well as other kinds but sometimes it feels like there is battle and antagonization taking place and then realized not as bad as it seems but still there being something about it. Reminds of a culture that would go back and fourth from decent and not decent fashion depending on the perspective and point of view but still a compromise. Some of that might be coexistence but at what point does the sand in the eyes spur action and at what point does poking the physical bear rip the god damn arm off spiritual metal mechs. What was the Mech Grip anyhow upon this and I did note there to be good within vicinity even though direction did look a bit different in the morning even though it was seemingly and the interaction an interesting topic this day. I went to sleep that is what changed seemed to be an answer decent and I had wondered if there was a tell in regards to insinuation in how some of the insinuations from the spiritual specific regarding psychictivity discernment and how some of the insuation spiritual had not been trying to insinuate what some were insinuating. Imagine sending a communication and just before communication reaches a certain areas it gets changed to reflect something totally different. What if some were thinking I was something that I wasn&#39;t, an interaction said to be from places where I went when I fell asleep. The scarier prospect was also that what if I thought I was something different upon entering certain kinds of Sleep Realms. I feel there was more than just dream as to what certain aspects of my consciousness and spiritual were experiencing upon going to sleep. Anyhow, I freaked out a bit and prompted what my Main Spirit Guides indicated but what it looked why  like had to do with laying the smackdown on any mech that was attacking me and my family as well as the others that my Main Spirit Guides in fashions that spoke of higher mechs. obvious reasons obvious for going with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated partially because some cant handle some of that direction, the real true, the response for it is outlandish to degrees unfair especially for those that are operate differently than going with Guideship in certain moments.<br>Pigmentation Primes and the culture regarding pigmentation. What is the correlation to Colour Primes.<br><br>Chlorophyll speaking of health and vitamins literally part of the reason plants are green on this planet. Speaking back to the Diary Entry about how important Plants and the fact that they speak of Health in regards to their literal physical and spiritual anatomical.<br><br>There had been these moments of researching Heroes to find symbolism and meaning in regards to some of the storyline emergence on my end regarding red, black and white w. brown as well as another synergy regarding Blue and Yellow w. green. Multiple kinds of Comic and hero moments with DC and Marvel but there was also something else happening too. Desire to research small kitchen jobs in town in hopes of therapy and money. It was like someone wanted me to be some small town hero in the form of a regular dish cook and I really dug the kind of life style portrayed psychically to me. There was also a preeminent let know that not all brown colour are supposed to be these scrappy realism in front of the scenes chafe against societal types that save the day. I saw from it a perspective that I agreed with and identified, just because I was black and red in a certain sense didn&#39;t mean I had to be the crazy extremist clown, the problem is that for me it was closer to the truth than some knew and I can&#39;t fully say that I haven&#39;t been taken seriously because the spiritual and other-dimensional have taken me seriously in many manners but there is still something there in regards to some of the things I said down here. Maybe I wouldn&#39;t be crazy to the degree that I am now if someone had, maybe I would be less extreme  supposedly and somehow the clown aspect told to be me would have pissed me off in the past but luckily I got healed of that in the past couple years. They aren&#39;t bad but rather extremely good and the real question there is where is the magic of such a way of life? Somehow if you see a clown doing fantasy magic that alleviates a certain kind of uncomfortability that exists and had been seen in some of the Physical Magic communities on this planet. I think some of that magic is used in a heroism sort of way spiritually. But what about the wonder? The brilliance is that it still exists and in large ways amongst the magic communities physically on earth-based, they create it everyday in the kinds of magic they create. It is real magic at times for some of it. <br><br>#Story #AfterAndDuringRealismMoments #Sports #Entertainment #Mechs #RideOrDieShirtMissingTheOrDie #WasItDayOrNightUponTheStandBirdFlyingAway #Heroes #Villains #Deadpool #BANE </div>
