<div class="title">(13-09-2020)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>There was spoken runners in the air and it seemed to me like there was organization upon the quick movements taking place with thoughts of locked doors and closed doors even in a move higher watch the door sort of way. To me it was like some spiritual needing what needed to survive and at what point are you suppose to let certain spiritual through or not reminded. I also thought of what the he ck it was as to why I can only go so far in regards to saving as to why certain others way more powerful than me in the Eldest Spirit and even less older kind still more powerful. One the thoughts was helping those more in the front of the scenes and with the magic I had seen within my process in how spiritual can shape interaction and what one experiences spiritually. The kinds of spiritual that can live life and speak and communicate in non-harmful ways about discussions and prompt of another&#39;s life path. I had seen the knowledge and free rights given to us down here physically and spiritually not only within the Light but also the Original Setting to exist to be true. It told that many of us are of the Good spiritual spoken of throughout space and on this planet for the Physical Humans with close connection to the Light in which holds variety of Light in which the UN has Chartered through physical writings with other-dimensional and spiritual placement of Energies as well as other kinds of spiritual phenomenon through physicals on this physical planet Earth in which does extend to Anima and Flora as well as other kinds of classifications of physical and spiritual life and beyond. This speaks of rights to live life without being harmed. To be treated how one wants to be treated. Rights that speak of the ability to speak of love especially from a life context in what one brought from higher places including Original Dimensional specifically within regular and normal ways of living through interactions of Nations and Dimensions seen to be truth. The fact that Non-Dimensional and Factional boundaries are understood up to the degree needed and how the odd ends factor in with the kinds of spiritual communication utilized in being able to cover a pede. We do want to be discrete with personal and love as well as whatever the hell else it needed to be that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and I had known venture to have taken a bit of a hit this past four weeks at first in ways not decent partially by way of circumstance intermingled with the events regarding Anti-Camp Decent and letting know of Good Authority within vicinity and even discussions of how old ones go about doing Anti-Camp decent in that there can be Anti-Camp decent set in manners within moral parameters and sanctioned as such to be true. It tied in with the kind of Ways of Life Facilitation and Quality of Life Facilitation upon the facilitators of such and the kinds of things set for even the bad would think good direction even without anyone being harmed in which also upon fair circumstances upon consent exists decent sized percentage in which can experience portions of scenarios given context of what is to be experienced. It&#39;s a resources though and the amount of dimensional, non-dimensional and spiritual creation, construction and other terminologies regarding creates advanced experiences that doesn&#39;t have to cost either if desired. A part of it can be work programs to garner better things if desired but there is also sand box modes with everything as to what one wanted to experience ready to go without anyone ever getting harmed, without any of what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this writing. The prevention of providing what is needed in the way of technological placement from the Higher Realms and other kinds being able to proceed with providing the ways of life magic and tech from being able to be utilized in certain dimensional areas has been a difficulty working past. It was such a reason why as to some looking at the topic mention and that of personal and love in the kinds of gatherings taking place to be given just communicational regarding especially if the answer upon some of the attack and defense happened to be because Quality of life and Ways of life reasoning. I looked at the Good all the while understanding some of that bad for a long time. The Personal and Love reminds of many but there was story firing that did happen, it&#39;s third portion of the red triangle is what some wanted to say for story purposes. With the White Triangle emergence in gameland and then the other connections too it might have made more sense given gaming context. Today Spiritual wanted me to stay away is what some said but one of the things that had been obscured was the Good that I was seeing and choosing especially in ways of proceeding even in more off to the side kind of places as well as the other one having to do Interaction and Direction. If it&#39;s suppose to look this way and it actually looks this way then note the observation. Especially wonderment upon going to the stars and what one has chosen for such which started with planetary in what the Planet would have chosen. I looked at my choices and realized that I am in line that connected to earlier moments and realization that other communicational lines more down and in front of the scenes at times did matter but it was actually a moment of realization that that the argumentative on my side was nowhere nears the vent needed for some of it and the recognization that behind scenes if that&#39;s whats going to take place and the old flip of the script that somehow the small actions within life was going to be the reasoning? Maybe it was the maneuvering to say those actions are more than what some thought that happened to be defensive posturing at times upon attack in which then made worse at times to protect and save but ultimately still put fourth a label at times. To what degree was it evident that it was warfare especially when not claimed to degree not so beforehand and at what point was societal kind understood for if Higher spirit watching down with one of his own spiritual literal maneuvered to other areas and subjected to things in which not permitted. I didn&#39;t want anything to do with some of the other societal to be true and somehow it was spiritual unlawfully combining with me that was going to be the reason as to why I had to tolerate being attacked from other societal in interaction spiritually? Near the end of the day after some kind of walk there was emphasis on something of colour that had been on mind connected with why we dont want to experience what we want to experience and it seemed to remind of better times especially others brought up related of personal and even gaming with other emphasis coloring perspective. Love and whatever the hell else was covered and saved in moments needed. That was acceptable. Would this long dreary life be worth enough without some camradre or would it better spent alone without anyone or anything around me and the other felt the same way, we didn&#39;t want to leave without on anyone but at what point do you not have access to what need to be ability to secure and keep safe privacy of future discretion with love. With technology and sight, direction upon ability already mentioned connected and is it within what one wanted to experience is one of the ultimate questions that deserves an answer of yes and should it be considered as such is within the context of the conversation. Was it love and family as well as others that were whisked away safely in the dead of night and would it not be just the good and beautiful but also those in need of many kind upon the battlement stairs in look downwards through jail bars and locked doors, attic entrances and other kinds makeshift barred and this look of cats venting and vacuuming whilst movers and shakers of Cheshire Kind looking upwards and around for more to clean and silent measure, the saviors of another kind and keepers of good order as well as sensibility and some wanted to know what a certain Cat felt of Reason as well as knowledge in an interesting thought to be delight that would provide what seek on curiosity even if for interests sake and why wouldn&#39;t it be colours of such to create the diversity of understanding and paint ones colours and chosen sometimes without choice especially if we are talking older Cheshire and how miraculous to see such cartoons within pop cultural emergence not too long ago. Somehow somebody never wanted me to talk about the Drugs but the kinds that are spoken of from my point of view authorship of this Diary Entry made it to point that the kinds of drugs spoken can be within normal boundary society and if it has to do with life drugs, like taking a drug addicted to different kinds of people than this topic can be at times difficult for how one feels but its more liberal up to point of acceptable parameters for of such for truth and the other kinds acceptable too, a pill that makes a cartoon sunshine pop up all day long with conversation about what need be within quality of life parameters for true is not too much to burden because there is a lot of things like that and the Cartoon sun lends energy at times to other spiritual of decent nature but also the other kinds in need but it only goes so far if there is another kind trying to do something different, and it can only go on so far until something is done. I wouldn&#39;t want to use recreational drug to harm someone else and I would not choose that willfully but the self defense ones are different and I do go far enough with how I chose in what my Main Spirit Guides relayed as well as going far enough with what I want to experience with drugs like cool gaming experiences and ways of life I would choose for truth in how my Guideship directs. It was on this topic nonetheless earlier of how some saw the world but it was also other colours that agreed. It was interesting that I saw brown as a certain in front of the scenes saving kind of realism that drove the world damn near crazy at times and I found the contrast interesting in how I viewed life. <br><br>Love, Personal and whatever the hell else it needed to be that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.</div>
