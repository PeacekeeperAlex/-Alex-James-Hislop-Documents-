<div class="title">(26/08/2020) &quot;August Vacation&quot;</div>
<div class="content">I realized societal for portions had lost points in this process when they left me behind but what was forgotten at times was also the amount of saving happening regarding. I knew something was over these past couple days and to be true in how I had sensed the spiritual maneuvering regarding, it was like they were trying to say something. This was but one aspects and the other ones they were trying to insinuate were past the realm of acceptability. I wasn&#39;t the only one who saw it that way. Why wouldn&#39;t some of the larger darker concepts scare to a certain degree but it wasn&#39;t even that. It was the even the small of some of it alone grouped together in which was more of what some were pointing towards. Today it seemed some wanted me to chirp societal but rather at the top I said something that needed to be said. We understood that certain things were over with in regards to this process, even days before me utilizing safety in life timeline manner where i felt energies in the future and past enveloped in saving energies. It was a moment where my life timeline changed and moved away from certain ill utilization. I could literal feel the energies in what i perceived portions of my life timeline and other life timelines as well as timelines within the moment of bring fourth saving energies regarding. Saved. Then yesterday something pointed towards where it looked like certain bad trying to utilize this life were not going to be able too anymore considering the lines in play, what has been understood, the kind of truth and knowing in existence and non-existence in which societal did safeguard me upon. certain kind saving past my points that I am ale to save. A certain terminology that exists and I had wondered what higher parameterworks that they operate under and how they are in the correct?<br><br>Of course some went another direction, and there is a kind where they are doing decent and/or not too bad in regards to utilization of my life in which had less to do with it for some of it depending on how much. The real problem for me I felt was the utilization that had been happening. In the middle of it though yesterday bringing up some of the old spiritual especially regarding that kind that reminds of morality, straight-laced. One of the classics on my end reminds of quick footed scouts as well as warrior type more akin to my kind of physical culture different than the classic barb although they have been around too. The Conan Saga upon me three days previous, played conan the Barbarian exiles and it was like my own personal moment upon crafting a video game characters and the beginning of the game was this intense in the correct moment kind of storyline for some of the tone of the process but also so far away from it too. On either ends. Gaming ever present at times in this process but then it was the look.<br><br>Earlier thoughts of the Author in regards to Conan the Barbarian with thought of remembrance regarding wiki page research in regards to such an interesting character. The worlds and universes that have emerged regarding are fantastic and spectacular. I know I view in a certain capacity, I am from the light and I know there to be existences that the good have crafted. For some of them crafted in violence depiction prowess. It was sort of the back drop at times with thought of such universe and even the love realms brought up in certain capacity later on that reminds of some of the female strong regarding such a universe. Again another shoutout earlier in which love police might have been around and an understanding in regards to certain culture. Strength, Love and Police officers as well as normal people kind of interaction upon a form utilization of a form reminded of an actress. There had been these moments days previous where I felt the spirit to be guiding a certain kind of interaction. Maybe watching Conan the Barbarian on my lawn was the way with a bonfire going in the background but yet there still was this moment where watching it my room felt more right. I had supposedly not watched on my lawn because of the subtle roast impressions in which might have partially been the good and a roast I wanted to watch. Again these moments of realizing different genre of spiritual filmaking upon physical films of a different genre. I have been scared of hyborian but it&#39;s also a certain kind that is partial facilitation of ways of life. *Expand different kinds of explanational regarding different spiritual aspects to physical filmaking. Then of course I watched the film after typing some of this diary entry. I had never seen it before until today so the communication was in mind at times. You know there is a natural communication that happens in regards to film and ones you have never watched before can literally change your but there is also spiritual updates and ability to be able to show spiritual aspects of physical the communication within physical film for portions but also the physical film itself in certain manners. So you dont have to worry if you didn&#39;t watch a certain physical film during your life as there is spiritual that facilitate in other ways not only in regards to getting some of the communication within film and of course there is spiritual teams and editing teams in which situate communication that you didn&#39;t want to see and the great thing about it is the view of choosing spiritual films through the physical film and of course for most physicals on this physical planet earth, they choose what there Main Spirit Guides chose for them to choose. You turn on a movie, spiritually there is movement and then interface from higher light and other dimensional in choosing media and other kinds not only through the physical film itself but also in regards to the story universe regarding such a film as well as the other kinds that exist too. For example, if a certain kind of film is not classically considered cannon and yet there is a connection to the film chosen, that might be a content as well that is chosen spiritual in which Spiritual Guideships do consult higher perspectives of physicals and people in which would indicate what they want to experience.<br><br>Safeguarding those upon my perception of certain kind being good. Certain bad sometimes being treated unfairly in a certain sense and the other kinds of ways to facilitate darker perception upon good perception via consent <br><br>Different kinds of culture coming around seen through earth-based filmaking on my end. I have seen that I can literally watch two movies side by side and see connection shaping regarding partially from my process for some of what I have witnessed. <br><br>Certain kind letting know that certain things were not suppose to happen. Certain kind also letting know of some of the economics regarding especially later on when it is more solidified especially upon that in which was supposedly not suppose to happen and how it can be something in which was suppose to have happened but for myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, the bad stuff that happened might be something in which wasn`t suppose to happen and is considered as such for portions.<br><br>Guideship<br>Situation rooms<br>Technicians<br><br></div>
