<div class="title">(26/11/2020) &quot;For the Therapy of the World&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>After the events of of some of the interactional regarding what I discerned certain memory and recordings events partially upon recording an Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Content which segwayed for most of the content to the 26th even though named though the 25th in the name where later on there was a Matrix impressional upon me where I could discern floating infrastructure to a certain degree also a presence of certain authority straight lace that understand situational.<br><br>Using awareness regarding physical live awareness in what they think they know to manipulate them spiritually and other dimensionally in directions unfair is remedies by way of the spiritual and other dimensional to a certain extent around them but should be understood if this kind of thing has been happening. Setting interaction helps in multiple manner. This morning has felt to be more silent than usual as is becoming the normality on my end at least for the more silent portion, there is still spiritual channelling  through, there is still conversations and discernment of different kinds of spiritual stimuli and I still discern certain kinds of actions taking place in portions of interactional overlap in which let know that there is still conflict in the spirit. How are we supposed to move away from that kind of thing if it&#39;s still taking place? Its a good question. A better question than how are we suppose to move away from that if still speaking about it because that&#39;s not realistic. Writing can be therapy and for me it&#39;s certainly been so. I have vented some of my frustration out more than most on this planet in a certain manner and its partly by way of knowing and believing. For  example, that there is more good than bad. To be some sort yield of fixing, repair and healing as well as situating on the similar kind of noting to the theory of being that pocket at the ass end of some sort of war seems to be upsetting would it not be for the knowledge that some customs find that to be an honour except the unacceptability within that kind of Jargon exists to high heavens. The Use and utilization of physicals and spiritual noted these days in prominent fashion of discussions and debates as well as proceedings of legal matters. Again, to jog memory might be a bit of redundancy currently, but if you were to take a look at some of the mental illness on this planet, realize that if what their experiencing is more in line with psychic experiences and technically psychic attack, then wouldn&#39;t that be considered wrong? If you take a look at multiple listings of some of the phenomenon that is described through mental illness experiencers and if it was extrapolated to be spiritual, psychic and metaphysical explanational through experiences right in front of the eyes of science and medical, who are suppose to be the ones who explain reality in what some though only had to do with at level dimensional and wouldn&#39;t it be interesting maybe some of the same forces manipulating mental illness or what was labelled would be the same maneuvering believability and doubt as well as normality in those supposedly more fit for societal in judgment upon those experiencing phenomenon and even ailment through in which of course was another sticking point that some in the spirit were trying to use against physicals science and medical on this planet, that somehow they had got something wrong except they also forgot something in the synergy of Faith and Science in Spirituality. That the fact was that science was paying attention that it was being done so in a gradual manner through societal. Scientific research on Paranormal, Metaphysical and Spiritual was taking place in many different manners across the globe. The status quo was being challenged, just not to the degree that some had hoped. Near Death Experience Research was a prominent example of this in the best ways. Even if there wasn&#39;t, just because science got it wrong in certain areas at times, didn&#39;t give the right for abuse or limiting quality of life, spiritually or otherwise. Many Spiritualists knew the truth regarding mental illness in what they believed to be true in which was being approached in ways of Faith and Spirituality but also Scientifically. It was why I loved New Age. The eclectic. The different kinds of approach synergizing and even contrasting without there being a problem. Except at times there was and it had to do with normality and status quo. Changing that for the better was happening and I did like the approach in gentle, gradual ways that was challenging the status quo in gradual ways but as that was taking as long as it did there was still those being thought to be something they weren&#39;t and at what point did anyone think that the medical professionals on this planet would somehow say something they didn&#39;t say in the kind of interaction setting that was happening didn&#39;t the hippocratical oath and I doubt that they wanted or chose that somehow the crazies of the world were to be thrown away. If you take a look at the interaction history in regards to those that were labelled as having mental illness on this planet for the past 500 years, you note something interesting. The messing with context would not stop understanding.  It wasn&#39;t old people that were attending those new age spirituality seminars, it was young people and it needed to be as well. Why would be want to go commercialism in ways desensitized, why would not want to focus on our own spirituality which for some of us included commercialism. The new gods spoke of it at times. Odin frowns, but not to the degree that some thought. It was interesting that Old Gods spoke of what the new would high attest in the kinds of experiences that could be set, created and constructed in what understanding knew in that I didn&#39;t have to say other kinds as it was already covered through supposed simplistic writing style. Why would I need to come up with another word after or to continue to say other kinds and as well as in regards to certain sentences but it was something I did at times in which might have been considered a redundancy.  <br><br>Today has felt to a bit of a back and fourth argument that is barely audible on my end. Meaning the manipulation and influence of certain spiritual upon me has been suppressed and nullified to a certain satisfactory degree although still left wanting in multiple manners. The Sky is falling mentality, I thought was already foracasted, but maybe it was acceptability in which labelled that it wasn&#39;t. Only understood for when it suited needs of what one was going for does some of those foracasts be said to be understood. <br><br></div>
