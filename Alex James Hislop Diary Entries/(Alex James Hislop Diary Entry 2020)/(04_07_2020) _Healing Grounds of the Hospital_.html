<div class="title">(04/07/2020) &quot;Healing Grounds of the Hospital&quot;</div>
<div class="content"><br><br>Activity:<br>As strange as this is, I have discerned Audio in regards to the taste of Mcdonald Big Mac. Don&#39;t call me crazy.  It reminds of impressional in regards to when you think of audio but within taste. I have family members that remind of that impression.Sometimes dark and clear in which I have discerned them to be good. I know that audio has been able to impact emotions. When I have utilized emotions and speak with my out loud voice I can feel that there is reaction from of the emotional and I have seen this as  a psychic too many times throughout my life indicating that audio can be seen from emotions. I discern awareness at times within dimensional stimuli, not just emotions or audio but other kinds more in front of the scenes but there seems to be component regarding multiple seen like this in which speaks of some of the stimuli not having this awareness. <br>This might have to do with the fact that there is another connotation of some of the impressional regarding audio. It reminds of Non-Expression. Understanding how important it is for Non-Expression to not create expression needs to be understood but also shaping aspects in the likeness of non-expression needs to be understood as well. I have noted both Expression and Non-Expression within Audio. Within the impression of when you think of Audio. The rights regarding both especially within the confines of Earth-Based Audio is important but what needs to be understood as well is that within the confines of Audio there is those that utilize as such to be able to express and to non-express. The idea I saw was a form utilization in which is invoking love in other dimensional in large amounts across the planet by way of utilization of in front of the scenes Audio to invoke loving energies from spiritual behind the scenes. Not to harm the Audio especially given that there is life within in which might be a large percentage. What is the spiritual statistics regarding? Idea to use beautiful form upon audio given consent regarding that in which has life and explaining the love creation regarding. The idea to be able to utilize this in other-dimensional regarding beautiful forms to invoke loving responses. What must be remembered at times is that I am good and moral. I would want this kind of way of life and idea in moral fashion with consent. I am not the first to have come up with this as it has existed for a long time but creating physical information can help regarding and the kind of beneficial pertaining can help heal spiritual. Imagine being able to streams of beautiful audio in forms that remind as such in other dimensional <br><br>The idea to be able to mask how one looks with beautiful forms chosen if not desired form within live dimensional to invoke Karmic power but I am hoping not to be utilized for bad. The Concept of Ugly exists and does wish to still be part of this world and when you see how concepts can work in the spirit it does matter but how one wants to look is personal at times. It would be like asking ugly to not look ugly anymore when the Concepts as such at least for portions does still want to look that way.<br><br>*Explain how I have loved regarding audio within music and the expression seen within music regarding as to why it might be that wee see more of this kind of audio that dark impressional kind through certain voice works on this planet. <br>Segway to<br>• Lies connotation and utilization against certain physical humans and lies itself at times in which truth can lament upon.<br>• <br>*Talk more about expression and non-expression<br><br>Healing and gum inflammation dimensional stimuli discerned, said to be suffering dimensionally causing problems and leading towards attacking physical gums either for resources and the fact that there is a mover of such stimuli at times. It has been seen to be red impressional like gums and there is an in front of the scenes emotional and impression especially regarding love connotation that exist.  There is accords and normality seen from physical earth-based science and spiritual science in which have shaped certain things behind scenes like a frameworks of normality seen within the that in which is thought to be<br>• There being a certain accords and normality within certain societal enforced by spiritual to try and help. a disease emerges in which does have spiritual connotation and after enough time there being a certain normality regarding in which certain physicals and spiritual as much as they dislike also prevents more of that kind of thing in the future. <br>• Head area layer grabbing of top of head skin stimuli, like a chip being layer over top of it as well as and movement of other-dimensional windy energies behind the scenes.<br>• I feel physical audio and audio has been protecting love and even other emotions at times. Physical Emotions are behind the scenes to Audio dimensional from what I have gathered as a psychic medium. That doesn&#39;t man there isn&#39;t ways to protect love in front of the scenes. The audio itself in what it does can protect emotions and does so daily. <br>• Dimensional overlap creation, big kind of dimensional creation noted upon me going to new market, I could feel dimensional overlap to safeguard but also I feel what needs to be understood is some of this dimensional overlap is not supposed to be attacked. It&#39;s supposed treated in a certain context especially pertaining to certain accords. I have seen enough bombings of buildings and destruction regarding for if life happens to be residing within those dimensions to warrant a let know regarding especially pertaining to my process. There is punishment alternatives that exist in which certain spiritual have safeguarded. A dimensional overlap that received turbulence a certain amount sometimes houses punishment alternative kind of spirits but what one needs to remember is that some of the don&#39;t deserve to get attacked for certain crimes especially upon taking the punishment alternative because they are not always what it seems. You might not want to be attacking certain kind for utilizing the punishment alternatives especially because some of them house spiritual that did not commit crimes and there are those you do not want to attack in which are traps. The legal standpoints regarding this matters but so do the other kinds of legal in which at times I have labelled Non-Legal in which should be remembered that there is a strong connotation for being not of legal. What is the circumstance of those in which would pursue certain kind that are utilizing punishment alternative to survive? Where do those pursuing such at times end up if the law catches up with them? Punishment alternatives.<br><br>This other dimensional that grabs hold of head area scalp impressions, it can feel smooth but it can also feel scrunchy on the head area in which is not trying to attack Mind and mentality at least not for a certain amount regarding that dimensional. <br><br>Talked about karmic lords<br><br>Discerned good winning in a fashion but then certain spiritual tried attacking. Phenomenon in regards to when I get pulled dimensionally to a certain spot thought to be memory, although at times I discern it to be different but the physical memory tabs might have been utilized in certain fashion with dimensional setup regarding. <br><br>I talked about the potential of splitting when I get to the Original setting safely while retaining a decent size portion of my power with the spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There was multiple talks of this spiritually as well in regards to others too. <br><br>A certain loosening n regards to being able to move around more freely. They said there was battle inside my body as well too but I am not sure to what degree. <br><br>Discerned time related events throughout the night and there was a moment where I felt to be attacked more in front of the scenes where somebody was done but maybe I wasn&#39;t attacked at all but rather certain spiritual maneuvering. Some trying to utilize certain time related reasonings for not fully knowing what happened on my today but on others ends as well. <br><br>The more I reflect on this day, the more I wonder if all is what seems at least regarding some of the interaction. <br><br>They tried to place certain baddies upon me, in which I feel is unfair in a certain manner given that lack of reasoning at times in which seemed for some of the turbulence yesterday to be taking place at times tried to be said because of me.
