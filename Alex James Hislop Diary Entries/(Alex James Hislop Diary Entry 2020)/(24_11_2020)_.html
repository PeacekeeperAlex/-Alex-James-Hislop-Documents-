<div class="title">(24/11/2020) </div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>One of the greatest questions though is whether the winnings that my Main Spirit Guides specified in regards to this writing had been won in the 3rd age. Why did the Original Creator walk away from saving instantaneously? Some might equate this to be related and it might be up to a point. Embellishment in regards to in front of the scenes writing exists whether be considered a redundancy or not.  There was an idea that had to do with being able to promote fictional violence in regards to non-life bots. The Original Creator was hesitant for obvious reasonings. I looked at what had happened for a portion during the 4th and said, &quot;Well, at least playing violent video games isn&#39;t a problem anymore,&quot; but what if it wasn&#39;t a problem during the 3rd for how I saw it. <br><br>Spiritual being able to experience what they want to experience regarding other dimensional and spirit interactions, family they wanted to see, their own cultural for how they saw and obviously within moral parameter which did include violence depiction up to a point. The fact of emulation existed, in a certain sense, decent to be able to feel the way one wants to feel up to a point but that having ones own spiritual around oneself for what one chose really did matter. Weren&#39;t those who fought for our defense as well as the innocent and innocence worth saving? POWs? Why are some of them considered POWs anyway? <br><br>Space interactions in what remind of space by way of impressional and different kinds of interaction regarding. I had wondered about what was happening during certain moments, a bit hectic and there is at times a lack of confidence by way of some of the response from the channel regarding certain things. Maybe it was all good, I certainly hope so but i am not certain that should the dictating factor as to whether certain defense intervene or not and it isn&#39;t the dictating factor to a certain degree. There had been a observation of impact upon my process I feel longer than just the past couple days. No Shit. The kind of cool that exists happens to be supreme should it be done in the manners that my kind of morality indicated and wouldn&#39;t it be interesting on a subject like this in the contrasting lines that exist. <br><br>An average citizen shouldn&#39;t have to worry about their nation upon doing research about laptops. There is a knowledge of namings and wordings as well as language in the kinds of connotation that exists. Knowing the difference between a civic product line and the kinds of defense that ones nation does through said product line shouldn&#39;t be confused with the kind of pretender antics that said nation is partially defending from. Similar namings in regards to product line and top secret facilities should be understood for the difference that exists. At what point does a nation not invoke safeties regarding in multiple manners, like if said nation was at war and the kinds of spiritual defense invoked happen to do with making a decision of using a product line named similarly after a governmental area. It&#39;s why Trust really does matter in the kinds of spiritual emulation and access to certain citizen processes. The connecting United Dimensions to my United Nations in an ethical manner, what would they indicate for such an issue as this? For what I have seen within my process and the kind of importance one emphasizes on ones own spiritual given access to ones own life process, let alone ones own authorities being given to ones own process. I noticed that there was a compromise that exists, instead of certain battle and warfare especially in the kind of potential damage that could be invoked, that within the confines of peace, there happened to be a cat and mouse game taking place. One would think that the average citizen is protected and I want to be that kind of spiritualist that says that is that case. Think of this though, multiple dimensional overlaps existing behind the scenes to an in front of the scenes dimensional being, so spiritual atmospherics, even though front of the scenes can be considered spiritual, still an understanding of behind the scenes emphasis at times through connotation, with the point being understood though, some of those dimensional overlaps have facilitated battle. Some do it in a contained way as to create stability and less damage. One of the variables seen is compromise and mediation in not having to invoke some of those battles but circumstances regarding either really do matter. Any form of a certain kind of corruption could create a diplomatic incident. Either way though, imagine something told where in another variable of one of those dimensional overlaps by way of some having to compromise would provide an outlet and alternative instead of having to have certain battle take place. Wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if the good really does have the power to save most if not all instantly and safely. I feel they do. Having to do certain things over again and over again is why some believed in atheism. Again, either way though, there was an identifying factor that spoke of options and choices. One could proceed in defending ones own in many different ways. Those ways happened to exist within the confines of good dimensional as well as except that if there was certain kind of baddies brought fourth overlapping, it lost a bit of muster. If those ways couldn&#39;t carried out in ways in which ones own morality indicated then what was the point? The problem is that if the good wouldn&#39;t facilitate certain areas and processes like how it was suppose to be then at what point to you not choose the shoddier option. Was it less of a choice? The idea remained as to the fact there was certain kinds of interactions reflecting spiritually around certain kind in which denoted why there nations operated in the fashions that they did. Which made it a curious question as to why some of those nations would proceed in the ways that they did especially beforehand. So a compromise to stave certain battle and then within the confines of choice, intervening and saying that it isn&#39;t enough in a masked hero in the night kind of way or even in a Bruce Wayne in the middle of daylight kind may. So if were all good then what is the problem? It shouldn&#39;t too much to amend and if so then the red tape really is destroying us. The whigs up and arms on either side of aisle to say they are the chosen ones in the mix. For some of them sit down upon the writing in which the subway walls reflected at times. How was it that I was to explain the kind of understanding I had of certain sects of the spirit realm. Why would it be that english was protecting such a word as spiritual, spirit and realm. Maybe it was perception that labelled that in which was mostly moral and good when said &quot;The State of the Realm,&quot; in ways that invoked understanding of another feathery get the hell out of my face from some of the puritan social clouths. Somehow my writing clashed with what I coveted in the kinds of truth that the spiritists on this planet earth indicated especially for the anchoring that they were to me as well as this planet and that I as well as the others was in secret at times to them and this planet. <br><br>That there had been groups dicking around people living life in ways to save behind the scenes, small things happen throughout your life, channel twich leading to dropping your favorite mug followed up by implantation of anger. That stuff that lead towards saving supposedly behind the scenes. That there was good doing that kind of thing to save seems obvious, some doing it in decent fashion. There was also those though that were doing it in indecent fashion. Saving others that didn&#39;t have anything to do with some of those in front of the scenes. It&#39;s interesting that group that continues to say for me to live my life bu also continues to harass and harangue me living my life in the kind of hypocrisy that exists. It was also interesting that many good groups have observed that I am living my life and feel for some of them that it is included in regards to me living my life. Rights issues and things of that nature, conspiracy theories specifically in regards to my societal normality even expanded is not necessarily the problem. <br><br>Themes:<br>#Debate #Soothsaying #Energy #Suppression #NoWalk #GoodThings #EitherWay #Regardless #Breakthrough #Work #Entrance #Guardians <br></div>
