<div class="title">(19/10/2020) &quot;The Gaming Culture Snafu Situated&quot;
</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Talked about life utilization and how to proceed with life utilization. Had been talking about locals and google transferring. Was walking about walks and being dry yesterday in the morning in finally seeing what some were talking about in a certain manner but also understanding there was a difference in a certain context. The importance of mentality and how that overhead hanging energy can affect other spiritual behind the scenes, you feel like not doing something in which reflects in mentality area which is like a cloud to other spiritual behind the scenes which can affect how they proceed. What is the point of mentality? Again the classic questions to what is mine? One of the things I changed about myself immediate physical this past couple weeks in let knows and creed building even though going with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding there had been more teamwork reveled in what I feel still existed beforehand but these days with the kind of realistic choices in front of the scenes as well as the kind of family emergence.<br>I went to the spot in my living room before entrance kitchen, earlier on days ago there was this dashing hope and some trying to say that my Archaic from where I was from had science above him too, you see I had physical zetans above me in a certain manner and they reminded. Again a shaping lent towards certain sporting noted but also innocence noted regarding the shaping of zetans and this cool woah expression at times noting the wonder of science.  There moments of discussion, where resources shored up in the past regarding Zetans. Days after this there would be moments brought up of neutral green light in a certain manner that some were trying to say needed psychological defense but I still feel them to be good and maybe it was thought about certain things. This was also near when I freaked out a bit on a good spell where I took a bath and it was spoken about frost giants, some bad experiences but not too bad, still shaky and there was something about transportation and a change taking place not only in regards to me as I was pretty cold but also something about my mother in a change where other dimensional substance noted coming from mother proximity in which reminded of days before in regards to me where spiritual were lamenting upon myself pooping in other dimensional. But, You see, it was in that spot before the kitchen where we started to talk about certain family and banners as well as a classic storyline about gaming. There was something about nations on this planet that was spoken about, we talked about mexico but there was also this let know of elders and what they were going through, beforehand it looked like someone who hadn&#39;t emerged in a long time had stirred. There was a tell to let know for elders to move upwards in certain manners. It&#39;s a tell about some of the interactions at times. There was this attack upon my hope I felt or maybe it was test and a kind of elder that both would want to call out certain things but another kind of elder that still cared about a certain respect. These two reminded of Cane and Able but maybe a certain Space version for how my perception played upon. but really reminded of an other-dimensional. One of them reminded of the gravity in regards to certain spiritual spending eons in certain areas to then have reveal that there were others out there in certain manner and the kind of matter and serious that really is in how at times some have viewed in flighty manner that does not fit the gravity. There was a let know of venture though and what had been happening regarding some of them that reminded of earlier process in multiple manners. I feel that many of them were ok but we needed to be realistic. To have the updates needed relayed regarding. I did care in many different manners. I have continued to try and help past process and one of the answer regarding my choices had to do with the fact that I was going with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated and might have been choosing certain kinds of revealed routes already in which might have had less to do with past process as I might have been one of those ones doing it since the first age, especially given the nature of the Origin Theory of Life that I had been working with and not say I didn&#39;t believe in others. God Spark lineage. Some wanted me to write down a personal storyline having to do with Purple and Pink as well as lavender. I dont know what the significance was but I didn&#39;t feel like elaborating currently about such a storyline. It wasn&#39;t just my storyline but there was something there. Self caves of certain spiritual that reminded of earlier on in the kind of off put and rehabilitation from certain kind of family, almost like discussions and conversation as well as some wanting an urgency to be understood regarding certain situations. Past Process Life Utilization family for a portion but not all of them. They deserved what they needed and I dont see how it would be too much. Early morning next day from this diary entry had seen a large amount of interaction in what still didn&#39;t do justice in descript. More good than bad was the real true even upon certain scares and awareness. I had still been unable to describe what kinds of family emergence had happened in the focal point of this process. It was one of recognization and remembrance even <br>Hibernation culture that was currently awake for some, Acting and realism culture that riffs off of God, another had been a past ye old engli of ingli kind olden style and then of course the in the kind of superimposed digital websites upon the truman, like a person next to me talking to me spiritually that reminded of audio equipment and prompter prowess, Music culture repair seemed to be a part of my Gods at times as well. There was this console and gathering culture of gaming but also other matters that needed to emphasized as well, programming and a certain kind of nodding at times with let knows of expression and non-expression. I wish I could relay the other cultured from past process needed in regards to this sentence. I needed to remember to bring them up in other diary entry pages but somehow I was worried I would forget, so if possible can some bring them up in the moments my Main Spirit Guides relayed regarding this sentence. The betting cultures and things of that nature as well as desire and intrigue culture amongst some in hopes of halloween gideon. Like somehow there was spiritually traveling amongst me in certain capacities in which deserved miracles anyhow along with the purpose of lively.  There was multiple gaming culture and a slough of different characters especially the JC Penny walk and wondered if they had worked on other characters besides earth-based and of course the answer was yeah for some. There had been spiritual that could traverse in multiple areas, some of which able to experience gaming and create entertainment but some of which wanted situating. somehow the ninth circle spoke. There was always those requesting energy. Some of culture still scared, There was even Glass Jar placement kind upon in psychic stimuli that did scare me at times, but it maybe it was me who scared them but I started realizing that some were more good than what some said. I didn&#39;t what this had to do with hollywood. Mortal Kombat culture but other kinds too in reminisce. The forming of a floating Planet of a thousand Cities seemed to be happening upon decent facilitation and facilitation of ways of life, different sections and with Gaming as the Core and remembrance of Smadrin and Voldy the Chemistry was past set in due manner.<br><br>Light and Setting that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, Speak for myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this sentence the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this sentence.<br><br></div>
