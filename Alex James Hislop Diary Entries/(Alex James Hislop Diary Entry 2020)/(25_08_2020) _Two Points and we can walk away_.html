<div class="title">(25/08/2020) &quot;Two Points and we can walk away&quot;</div>
<div class="content">The one where it started turning that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I want to say it might have been a life preparation moment in the past. The other point was to situate what ever the hell else needed that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. It was a specific point to a certain degree before being suppressed on head before being able to write it down. Today has felt like something to do with the past but yesterday felt present and the kind that can be past and future and still impact the present maybe just as much even if not a present moment. Moments in Time.<br><br>Yesterday it being understood that I am good moral and the day before as well upon some deep cover being deployed upon me but also a utilization regarding me that hasn&#39;t been acceptable upon the shapings of certain history in which wasn&#39;t supposed to be and the kinds of misunderstandings perpetuated through this willfully in the kind of perception and thought to be corrects when revealed daily around me and in other kinds of ways sometimes set in stone unbreakable. One of the points though had to do with the lack of defense. It&#39;s not supposed to be this way.<br><br>Today has been more about talking about certain things that some espouse to not want me to talk about but behind closed doors try to get me to talk about it. Creation and Nature but it was a whole lot more than that. I don&#39;t blame the naturalists in the sense that some think and at times certain spiritual have tried to utilize how I feel even in regards to simplistic things, like not wanting to go to some job to be able to barely sustain quality of life. <br><br>The streamlining of certain storylines this past week has been seen but it has also been seen to be more than me in which doesn&#39;t denote this to be my life. As much as I might want to facepalm the entire way through, I dont think it would be fitting, maybe metaphorical purposes. To be true though there is face palm moments. Shit fit fight in regards to other dimensional placement between reasoning on either side of the aisle at times has been present but that has been less of the worry as of late with a focus upon the spiritual and other-dimensional information. I dont why some want to continue to heighten and let be known through my out loud voice what some dont even want me to talk about but to be true it had less to do in regards to the voice for some of it and it sure as heck had less to do with talking for a portion. What exactly is it about yesterday about interaction and life utilization? It was like I could feel battle regarding both in a certain sense, not one regarding where you can feel the battle energies but one where you have a feeling it might be taking place. Small chatter and looks here and there coloring something understood in the history books. Moments in time this day and how they can set it up looks normal which really does lend towards certain caseworks. What needs to be understood at times is that societal continues and what also needs to be understood is that when within certain societal not enough safety and defense emphasized that there can be angry and lashing out. I dont know at what point that isn&#39;t expected for either. It&#39;s the crime of it to be true that there is good and decent on either sides of that debate in the spiritual. Whether we should painlessly be transported to higher areas and/or original setting or not. Instantaneous situating. Streamlined. Quality of Life just as good if not better than before while still retaining the current of the situation. This exists, it&#39;s not just a pipe dream but rather spoken of daily on international televisions in many society. It exists for a reason. The real truth is that some wanted to steal and the wanted me out of the way. Gaming. I think it had more to do with something else to be true. Maybe it was the Troll Toll to get from out under the bridge. Legit trades masked as stealing. It was both. That I would garner enough gravitas to have my process be shaped this way, I thought was beyond me but I know I have a strength they needed and maybe I needed but at what point do you get to a point where you would take that strength away. It was even little things on my end manipulated.<br><br>Spiritual manipulated to hear a portion of my process and to do something in which ends up with a let know that it was not exactly as it seemed. The kind of unfair regarding exists at times and I wish it was more fair, I would choose it to be more fair and I have something to do with it. These subjects have been spoken of before. We have talked about it within the past in my process but strong today and yesterday was the feeling in talking about such subjects not just from myself who naturally feels like speaking about portions of other subject but also from the spirit. A labelment of this process from some just trying to put the blame elsewhere seems evident and folly. Maybe it&#39;s the folly though to ignore the process variable in regards to blame. There is an expectant though in regards to hearings and stands. I dont think too many spiritual thought I wasn&#39;t going to be taking the stand with the amount of testifications I have done. It done on the subtle at times but maybe the bigger worry might be past diary entries and future diary entries relaying darker things rather than freedom fighters to be true on the defensive in offensive fashion. At what point cross line to those that are further in the lower downs and middle spiritual that it is thought of &quot;Oh just those&quot;  some with connotation of true bad upon forgotten good.<br><br>One of the questions I asked myself, was how much time was passing spiritually behind the scenes? I had felt spiritual maneuvering of energies reflecting experiencing time and realized the spirit for a portion of them can manipulate such energies. Imagine feeling sluggish sometimes being a tell of slower time upon oneself. I had wondered if the events that some thought had happened and the movement regarding in my process as well as other tells of the past had created a certain kind of dynamic not always seen in regards to Physicals in this space. I think I am not the only one and it might not be that strange of a setup to be true.<br><br>They said there was a War in Heaven at one point in time. How was I to be sitting on the couch or laying on my bed, might have been for a walk, went some where else once in a while, most days stayed in my house. I thought at what point this didn&#39;t make sense in how wrong in certain moments it all seemed to be at times, like somehow this wasn&#39;t supposed to be and it was partial reason for conflict and something in which might not have happened. <br><br>Today seemed to reflect some of the reasons why and the conflict discerned had been eventful for what the mood discerned feeling but on my end it was enough. to be true in psychictivity terms it looked to be discerned as to the reasons there is such battle in the wings and for what it seems other places too. Spiritual going too far. it&#39;s appalling to be true for some of the things seen and witnessed, the kinds of ruckus and turmoil and some even claiming   the metaphorical seen regarding the World Wars seen on this planet in which was thought of to be simplistic comparison for bigger conflicts in order of logical economics of interaction and communication in which remind on different scale. Ones in the spirit that had happened long ago but also not that long ago. Almost three generations ago for the last. The smaller economics exist as well in minute form at times. What was it that wise men and old spiritual pointed towards regarding earth-based especially regarding story purposes in which purposes itself might have been the proper terminology reference. To be the one of the ones on this planet as a physical, I had wondered how the other were fairing. I am an overweight psychic who still lives his parents but understands the destiny of recycling and compost but is was also garbagio in which spiritual resources management will know what I speak of. In which in the spiritual they say when you do battle sometimes the kinds of circumstances especially from oneself proves a point. I don&#39;t fully know what it was to move me towards informational placement but it might have been the knowledge seen at times and the prospect of the kind of good I can do by way of such an endeavor. The Diary Entries and other books writing, content creation and website building, the arguments and the conversation, the spiritual show understood like knowing a circus and assemblies exist in spirit around people and spiritual. It gives a clicking tell about reality in the kinds of experiences I have seen in how the spiritual can look. Aesthetics that remind of everyday life and similar cultures seen on Earth-Based but also elsewhere in which understood includes many different fashion of styles, even Alien stuff that reminds of beyond a certain kind of nature. Dreams of aliens earlier in a psychic interaction reminding of Advanced rooms of trade, Gambling and gaming but also clarifications upon knowing the direction that the course is turning and to be true the Good Times remembered is what was reflected in perfect momentus with decent coverage. I didn&#39;t know why some disliked as much as they did but it didn&#39;t matter at a certain point. Whatever the hell it was that was eating away at the hearts of the good to be able to intervene mended and healed to point downwards movement with a hug from eternity surroundment of that in which mend prove mended for no amount of hatred and pain was going to change the inevitable and of course the are we on course is mentioned and the other side of the coin in which similar mention keep in good spirit for never not might not hold his peace. Handing his piece mentioned but somewhere nears to the flight remembrance of gangsterdom these days and again another thought similar as before regarding such gaming inquiries and if it wasn&#39;t interaction or spiritual guideship suppression then I would assume  needed communication and love for such remedy upon the prescription and pursuit of the Computer repair maintenance, the new hard drive and windows key in sweet repose. It was something similar where I looked at something and said why not be the moral archetype that I am. Work down frobuot m top anti-camp decent kind, sexy and beautiful. The Purple in mind reminded of the Strong and Silent that scowl with putting up with antics but there was something more that did remind of not only myself but my brother. I remember limosines and suits with this lavender grey energy. I remember the red as well, some thought maybe more anger than love. Green and blue, the interesting of such colours of some not desiring me to be. White had stood out today and they tried to compare to Bane, clean black. They said the Overseer was the physical and that Mr. Glass was the Spiritual. The gradual might be here sooner than some think. There was spiritual that showed at my door with looks of high authority. It seemed to be important to a certain extent but I had wondered if this was about something else. The spiritual all around me in strong ways with large gravity. It was almost a miraculous sight to see the freedom fighters completely dismantle the day previous, it was the real true. They worked together though with the societal guardian types for many and it was actually a certain discernment that it many color come to aid those on this planet in time of need. It was the contrast of understanding comic book villain character morality and the remembrance of another at what point. I seemed to look around and so did other spiritual and I thought, geeze, there all good guys. It was even the look from the bad upon some of the pots and pans charges upon some of the aggressors against this process that can put into light the kind of banding together survival that exists and who would I be without facilitating an advocation. I and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated are advocating for what my Main Spirit Guides relayed in regards to the Spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides listed that banded together the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. At odds at times was never going to be enough to stand in their way. <br><br>This was the day where there was a segway from Freedom Fighting and spiritual rationalism masked as extremism. At what point does a spiritual maneuver in an outlandish way in which upsets societal but understood to be defensive due to circumstances. One of the things I thought of yesterday had to do with ways of operating especially in regards to spiritual freedom fighters and the other kinds of fighters too. The emphasis in regards to proceeding emphasized in regards to Self-Defense and defense of ones own. Proceeding in regards to moral fashion and good ways and not being being the bad. They never wanted to be them because many of them were defending themselves and some of them forced for some to have to utilize freedom fighting aesthetic. You see the classic military impressions and even they seen reasoning as to why some of this kind of archetype emergence took place. I have seen both working together in the battle and war that has emerged at times and the understanding of that kind of conflict has been suppressed and taken a back seat at times in this process even while still darker things taking place. Like noting as a psychic medium hurt or harm happening when Warfare is not talked to be involved. The segway went from that kind of freedom fighting spirit to military and regular societal vibes. There has been this classic in regards to societal types and maintenance in which I feel some have been trying to harass the good regarding at times and yesterday I noted haranguing regarding.<br><br>Emphasized with what higher guideship is indicating because they can see the situation more than most can in front of the scenes and with compassion  and logic.</div>
