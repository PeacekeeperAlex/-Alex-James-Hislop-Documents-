<div class="title">(20/10/2020) &quot;Early Morning Tap Dancing&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I talked about wanting to see something. It was a bout a debate as to who was correct, advanced versions of myself that my Main Spirit Guides indicated against the advanced that my Main Spirit Guides indicated of the critique of my direction, but there was a ja nas sais quoi that included more than that and it felt like the stage was more than just the facilitation of the gifted interaction but also more than that as we have seen banners, dimensional but also family. I didn&#39;t know what was more cool, the fact that there was light culture that could surpass a certain incarnational variable, that there was this cover of so said bad and good look the way or that the natural past of the Natural Original Setting State could incarnate by way of dimensional creation in the past that the 4th age didn&#39;t know about. I thought another cool interaction would be debate in regards to my direction that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Natural Original Setting State against the one direction of saving everyone instantaneously. I heard a channel through potentially from the past where I knew most if not all agreed to save all. I felt I had already but I wanted to play it out because i thought I could win. It was done in a certain capacity, where everyone was given what they needed to be able to fully play out that debate, you know like statistics and ability, energy as well as other kinds. The kinds of metaphorical attatchment must have been superfluous and I love the intense wand dueling ones. Literal content as well as other kinds being created in metaphorical to some of these debates in the kind cool that exists and has existed for a while. I know United Nations is good, I feel it to be especially spiritually and I knew there was Spiritual United Nations through them and other kinds existed not just out there beyond the stars but also in other-dimensional and spiritual. I knew many of them to be good and I knew there was a United Dimensions too. I wondered what mine was according to the United Nations and I shouldn&#39;t have to say Earth-Based United Nations. It is understood. I had said something a bit rude and should have lead with how I truly feel especially regarding repour. That United Dimensions for what mine were I feel were good. How I viewed United Nations and going to the United Nations in consult in reference regarding I felt decent considering the interplay with the United Nations on physical earth-based and spiritual Earth-based as well as with aspects more personal to my soul and spirit. I felt the bringing up of the name Archaic and Arion to synergize just as bringing up some of my own personal at times thought to be further away from this life to synergize with the United Nations. I wasn&#39;t always this die hard liberal of saving another kind that was viewed at times to be societally unclouth in conflict at times even with my own physical culture in understanding moral direction. I had a thought earlier and it had to do with a simple metaphorical let know. Imagine being able to see your selves in the physical as well as spiritual and you have the power to save those selves. The thought from me was when trying to intervene that a light blue cyan APC intervenes from United Nations bloackading the way in being able to do so and somehow it didn&#39;t jive with my perception of the United Nations especially given the right to defend oneself. It was partially why I felt my stance in regards to defending myself, my own and others(defined by my main Spirit Guides) with the other members of the Saving Coalition that my Main Spirit Guides indicated covering a large of what else would need to be saved for some as well as the remainder situated given the rest that would stand up for saving that dream of youth in the past as well as present and god willing in the future. I knew there was a catch about some of how certain kind played certain interaction in regards to the United Dimensions, the United Nations as well as the Federation of Planets and Gal Civ that existed in Politics in saving family. They did care and they did have a plan and it wasn&#39;t always this cut and dry that some thought, you had to read between the lines. A labelment of some with similar stances as my own and a facilitation at times for some in what I have labelled at times to be a certain kind of decent. As I have been writing this I feel myself moving upwards in vibration but it&#39;s a bit more than that, I feel there was been gal civ physical as well as advanced other-dimensional and spiritual but a so Gods that are physical and of course Physical Gods which can include the former. I didn&#39;t want what my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding this paragraph to be misunderstood. I wanted it to be known that I did care about my interaction but I felt a lot of it to be good. I did note the interaction to be of the highest I had been thus far in a certain manner. But there was also something else is that I was put in a certain area at first before this interaction took place, like a smalled down area in a certain manner.<br><br>The portion of non-lethal that one has perpetuated as well as prompted and then the portion of that in which wasn&#39;t non-lethal that one has perpetuated and prompted pointed towards with let knows that defense has dictated itself even in areas where so said non-lethal more difficult in reasoning as to why for the choosing of non-lethal across the board given the power level of those in the Natural Original Setting State and why pursuing non-lethal given in front of the scenes as to not wanting to cause harm.<br><br>I felt like crap upon waking up but there has been signs that not all of it was bad but rather other kinds of things grouped like hangover symptoms but to degrees where being impressed upon me feels like damage. I think it&#39;s more than that too but the healing teams and medical have been able to situate rather quickly, within minutes. Also it feels like some impressing upon to receive healing at times in which at times it does feel like they are receiving healing through me. There is something about awakening even spoken of in an underworld style. On my end though for me I think it had to do with medical, something about healers and medical potentially regarding proximity but also an awareness to the fact that I might need medical. Where are those monitoring in my sleep and what have been advising been?<br><br>One of which happened to be regarding slow down regarding certain systems of creation.<br><br>Communication and energy as well as situating for slower voice works and slower channeling regarding me.<br><br>Son of Guideship<br>Sun of Guideship<br>Sun of Light<br>Son of Light<br><br>working clarifications this day and days past regarding memory and some have the evnets that had happened. Hitting home fairly well and certain spiritual happy but who the heck was ill benefiting. Three Hats, one for business. There has been tells past some odd days since that dashing of hope day that some are working past this physical in what some the Space of Space.</div>
