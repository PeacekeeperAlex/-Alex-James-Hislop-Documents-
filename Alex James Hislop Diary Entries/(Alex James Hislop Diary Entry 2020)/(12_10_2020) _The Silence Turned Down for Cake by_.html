<div class="title">(12/10/2020) &quot;The Silence Turned Down for Cake by the Ocean&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I woke up this morning and it was one of those ones where I felt the past rushing by like wind in excitement. It was some of the old rabble. They reminded of dry orange in a certain fashion, dry mahogany true blood for vampires in the ways that can remind of spiritual culture not forgotten. The have a way about them, kinds of reminds in front of the scenes and lower downs. Teams that traverse to safe areas in handing out resources not just snaking. As I typed, I realized that last realization upon the page. I gave a rundown of some of phenomenon that had been happening regarding digital but also segway to real physical seemingly affected in ways where reconstruction seen and unseen as well as unforeseen. That these kinds of phenomenons where taking place and that it did include paranormal and in fact the paranormal spoke of such phenomenon in and of itself. It was brilliant for portions but darker for others to suit the aesthetic of what one enjoyed and disliked. Civility spoken on this days title. Respect for silence had one of them. I could see a metaphorical of danger and yet remedy upon the previous made me satisfied. I had been one to recognize that even Defiance could be realized as respect. At what point did some of the darker have to sort and organize some of the different levels of respect and disrespect to maintain and even this point on a single of organization told the point that needed relaying. Of course some of the Light kind of disliked me writing about some of the darker at times and I see why they afraid but it also never fully hit home in relayance upon what I was trying to let know, the fears and shivers that were than just a scary movie but rather nightmare of reality. How was I to let know of perish of gazillions up itself in asking how many Gazillions especially upon response of brass even in situations where peoples were starting to understand. The Stand in literal partially being usurped by a symbolism thought to be less powerful and understood for the previous partially ruffled in understanding. The I N G of it all known today maybe more than most in though what should have been present rather than future but was actually past. In the debate forums of which ones deserve more protection, the easy answer seemed to be all but it was actually more difficult than what we assumed at times. For if we protect all and the group remaining the next evil upon not being saved and illogical proceedings precede, then there would be less of a chance for the Plan. There was logical reasons as to why instantanious 100% saving possibilities still existed during events such as has been depicted with spiritual media especially on this planet. The reasons were obvious. Higher Direction not reflecting what need be in order for those in front of the scenes and elsewhere to proceed in fashion more compassionate. The answer from higher areas explained honestly is what saved grace but also dashed desire. The knowing that it could be if we saved past and chose past in the butterfly affect that would save present, but it was also that classic of saving self and the synergy of present that mattered too. It was a balance and the instability was not going to get in our way. But should it hinder could be the difference as to why those hopes in jeopardy. Double Jeopardy situations denoted the desire and need in truth of importance to receive what one needed in those kinds of situations. The crux of the arc wasn&#39;t going to stay stable forever if the events continue to accelerate. If we could fix that remedy that would allow us to be able to accelerate without there being a problem then we would be prosperous. Either way though given realistic choices of the scenes and the tell of physical still remaining even though with some of the changes that the cornerstones and anchors witnessed for a portion told that we still needed to situate. As much of I want to cry for other-dimensional especially upon metaphorical utilization of physical in which had less to do with metaphoricals, there was still great hope and even pride in witness and testify that told of Good being in use as well in such &quot;metaphorical.&quot; As a physical Psychic-Medium I have still noted phenomenon taking place and especially upon the sleep, realization that utilization still of import even though ill use still resided which is why stringent safeguards were prudent and existent. A classic example of this had to do with some of the current phenomenon which was connected to the past. This had to do with safety and family as well as other kinds. On my end, family had made its presence be known in many manners. One of which had to do with after that night when talking about Extra Terrestrial but especially proximity given perception of my physical pop culture. I thought of the Grey Zetans classically referred by physical humans on this planet as Greys. They told of innocence that worshiped science not some mindless drones. They were even egg heads of intelligence but something else in their body told of a lot of hearts. Emotion. What were they experiencing and signs of deliverance of resources sometimes seen within the eyes of the greys. Days previous there had been moments of Space. A Scene where I had researched a simple thing having to do with the Age of Space. It&#39;s a normality to research science especially one so open to public domain. It relayed the importance though of even the small kind of science in how some see. Another moment had to do with gaming and gambling, the TD of it all had a big day and saved in the movie itself. hat day it turned darker for the kind of audio torture discerned. The Starships and let know of family especially rehearsal culture. Noting the maturity in those older than me but even younger for look upon 90s cultural professionalism on another day. Even later on a scene in the kitch with Earth-Based characters for a shoutout of Jesus walks on metro road. Where confetti truth relayed enough of the fact after piecing together. Anger with the joke and lack of respect of the Riddler in what some hopped to be the last lash. Another though had to do with with that night with greys. Each day seemed to lend towards the shaping of a specific person I had seen trying to deliver that free pizza in which was interrupted in the middle. I was even able to see some of the setup where the person didn&#39;t exactly look to be deliverying the pizza to me. I think they the others that intervened offered jobs better than deliverying free pizza. But what was misunderstood was that it might have had less to do with pranks and ore to do with other kinds of reasonings. Giving food for thanksgiving could have been one of them. Multiple moments though of that person seen trying to deliver that pizza and the shaping regarding her had reminded of some good in my process, even with cocked look to the sky. I realized something. That natural time existed but that it originated from the Natural Original Setting State. It wasn&#39;t the only Concept where it Originated from such a place as well as Other Non-Concepts. Space, Time, Life and Motion were four such concepts where there was a certain natural law regarding in the Original Setting State. We continued expand upon throughout the days simplistically on my end but more advanced on other ends which did include aspects of this process. Another realization about been about the facilitation for this process as well as other kinds but that in which already was told earlier in this process but now more expanded. Like Characters in a movie of series sorting through their own stories coming together and that amazing feeling of watching a character and multiple characters earlier find each other even if some of them couldn&#39;t fully sense. The Ideas were there that past within natural time could see some of us and there was a parental figure and creator figure sometimes one and the same watching over and in charge of moral direction. Again I had named this figure Archaic in the first age. but as more creation emerged within the second age and third age, like family born there was other figures especially potentially in the third age. What we need to remember at times was there were moments in the first age where Archaic was just gathering his bearings. Natural Anatomical regarding spiritual in the Natural Original Setting State reminded of something that I had learned in which physicals on this physical planet earth as well as other kinds could reflect on future in memory fashion, you know how you think on a point of time frame in the past and that memory moves to a registry indicating sense of the memory but also of the time.
