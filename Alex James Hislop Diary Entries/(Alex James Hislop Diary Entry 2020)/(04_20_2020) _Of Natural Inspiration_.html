<div class="title">(04/20/2020) &quot;Of Natural Inspiration&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Quotes:<br>“So many books, so little time.”<br>― Frank Zappa<br>++**                                      **++<br><br>**True Good Breathe Here**<br><br>&quot;Hopes of Restless Stars in the Night long back Nightmares over&quot;<br>&quot;Hope and Restless Stars in the Night long back Overmare&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hi Ho Silver, Away!&quot;<br>- Bill<br><br>Activity:<br><br>Early Morning this day and I can feel the reinvention of myself continue from the night and become Truth and Reality. The smudges of my character ironing through the continued direction of myself and the elders at times requested. The continued knowledge of my direction of good has been told and understood to be honesty in a cold breeze of morality. I can feel the spiritual around me at times and though not always decent, clouth or understandable, certainly undeniable and for that portion of self that shakes his head upon such a need of sanity there can be no rest for the pursuits needed to mend of self for real in how I view such matters. I can feel the Good here. They reviewed it was that whatever happened to me these past couple days. They for a portion have reviewed the month and that sane part of God that still exists truly holding it down for the beginning cross referenced with the abilities and characteristics and Traits of the Earth-Based Physical Human that understands Ethical Morality and Realism, the realistic personal is to be true a small in the mix at times compared to the other expanded version of God in regards to the True Good Aspects of Self that Origin speaks of beginnings. You know what I speak of. and what I am pointing towards doesn&#39;t always jive with self but not to the degree that some were hoping because Reality speaks louder than words sometimes. Violent video games exist and I do apologize for my indiscretion but the direction experienced sometimes down here validates why I feel the way I feel at times in a life that didn&#39;t need validation upon what I already believed and held true to be. It was a stance already garnered regardless of needs in other time frames for support. The promised Lands exist and the spoken word is everywhere if things at times for espoused be true but at what point do we not want to know the horrors that exist and the balance for how we would proceed within life not be geared for a direction of what actually happened. Work has been seen to be tiresome at times but not to the degree that some would have you believe especially not in the places we go after death for the Good and True Good, even understood to exist and for a reason of manipulation for the bad who be as such in the places that they need not be harmed or harm for such pursuits they want to live and even those that do want a more aggressive route existent even in my books of existence of acceptability. The writer ever grateful to have access to reservoir of being but scared to compare it not existing without the terrible things that potentially happened. It makes one believe that the setting of ability a dream come true even if not what some would consider to be a clouth existence. It&#39;s interesting how I both care and care less about such notions. At what point do you want to be a good writer and does such abilities manifest anyhow. Not because of the bad things that could have or might have been but because one wants to be what on e wants to be without fear of utilization of such a line from those that would do dirty. The How Dare look of it isn&#39;t as dire as what some have insinuated but in some areas in might be worse than what has been prescribed at times in the name of the Ones that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the light and it&#39;s partially lending towards a perception that doesn&#39;t fully make the grade of course only when it suits for what&#39;s acceptable. It only goes so high up and in suing for saving upon such an interesting perception of the higher good in them not saving at times for when saving was needed how could we not see why some would go the path of preservation but again it only goes so far up in the dimensional higher to degrees that are defined to be and don&#39;t think the kinds of outlook that can exist are looked past upon such scrutiny of mattering. They say I had cover. They say that I had more what some insinuate and if I was a catalyst as they have said me to be than wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if I was not suppose to be here but rather was suppose to be somewhere else. I don&#39;t know I fully believe that as I find it would be difficult for me not to have known about some of the things abound but if a put fourth variable was something similar as previous than the nature of the direction changes again. It would be not at my behest to put fourth that variable, the monkey wrench to make things more difficult but rather something else. At what point am I suppose to use my spiritual training if I had known about certain events and how much can it truly help me as to where I am, knocking on good doorstep and good knocking on mine. Deployment and Retrieval. It seems to be these days and the Good have done their diligence. It feels like the good have come through to be true. Even with all of the terrible things to have insinuated and seemingly seemed to have happen this past three weeks, the amount of perception building and let knows of good have been more so compared to bad and the first of April might have been a good sample size to be seen as to why to partial reasoning that is the case. A positivity variable that did lend towards spooked disposition for when I talk about Ages of Positivity something changes even while those that would talk about such things daily if known under siege. For how many times on the other side of the world was their the good conversation of why we still exist happening while my biscuits burning. I suppose the Ripple Affect wanted give me a bit of a wind in which was cut short upon the desires of some that night in the battle that waged upon the step of earth on my side of my property. Quick situating for more proof that family is supposedly more valuable than the valuables of Family if only not everything carried life and that line of essence and soul of an item respected to be for what it has claimed to be especially upon retrieval. What else but to figure where out next to go cause what&#39;s it going to be to loser to do anything else be but that scare and no else but reason you me who why and thanks but whatever it was hope not measure or grace and why but only Always and that for no shame but Love and Truth for that reason fool which nor else if need be but right and fair if not I am Scared which it wasn&#39;t with justification and reason even if the subtle type that no one Believes ins in pure genius and best ever if wish but I would rather continue to work through m y life and need to continue on paths set and difference even if not in fashionable style in which this is what it was from the start when it was much more civil to be true and mend be facilitated hopefully forever by true good. What next but when the noon if high the next is over. t weren&#39;t we would be generally favorable the best ever to be true but it seems to be the more turbulence and conflict to be true. The Safety regarding matters of most import and need be and I Still love because I want too. Because I want to be able to have my most grace to be true which was always beautiful why wouldn&#39;t I be scared for death and the terrible things already done spaceman and things to remember to be and always love and be good were well with what some wold be not wishing to be harmed. Happy. and Anger as well as Sadness with the all else or what need perfection when we type better be here and call you a need not be oh what not better not see a lucy look. Spiritual Form and dimensional setup bear reason to be and the data brilliant to be true and I am thankful and that&#39;s always partial reason to be true and be reason to be. The wild nature of things has been seen to be of just nature many of the times and stunning is a good nature. To be true I am sorry, I never meant to be full catalyst at times.
