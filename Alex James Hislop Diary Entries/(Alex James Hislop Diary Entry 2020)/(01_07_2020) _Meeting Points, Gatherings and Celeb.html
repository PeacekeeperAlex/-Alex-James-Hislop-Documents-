<div class="title">(01/07/2020) &quot;Meeting Points, Gatherings and Celebration&quot; *</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>The title speaks a lot of what I had been experiencing early morning today but also a bit nearing the night time as well. There had been tells of celebration and get togethers. It seemed some of the good reluctant but a change in demeanor for me in the direction of not getting angry at the aspects of the Original Creator that my Main Spirit Guides relayed as well as others especially given the tell upon utilization of other dimensional aspects regarding myself as well as other kinds in which might have been going farther than the verbal spars. I had been able to come up with in which some of them I am not proud of but recognized anger and upsetness given some of the circumstances and experiences garnered at times, I realize it&#39;s not really his fault. Either way it segwayed to a certain kind of interaction and leeway in which certain kind of spiritual like to see given some of the lack of working together. <br><br>Trying to change the perception in regards to how I view form and the association I have regarding physical. Like understanding that there is other dimensional in regards to the forms associated at times with some of the physicals on this planet Earth but I have continued to maintain an emphasis in regards to form association regarding some of the physicals because I am physical. <br><br>Let knows of certain spiritual that had been around me earlier in which might have something to do with certain meeting points regarding earth-based history. <br><br>Looked like the good was celebrating and experiencing some of the spiritual atmospherics and good times abound. There was also tells of stability although wherein the bad seemed to be also experiencing some of the good flavors in moderation given context. There was moments where it looked like some of the darker and more dangerous working against tried to maneuver and I still discern a variable of good with backs against the walls and on the fritz. And there has been other dimensional infrastructure in which was a focus point this past couple months at times take another hit in which had already been through some tough time regarding within the past week. An infrastructure having to do with dimensional body creation but also movement of spiritual through me like some sort of filter. There is multiple kinds that i have discern regarding, manual, certain spiritual technology. <br><br>Prompting urges and energies laid back and more lax these days for some reason, some in regards re-situated but some of them not necessarily wanting or at least let known to be. I can feel more shy and reserved. Earlier it looked like getting to a spot where I did necessarily want to confront certain kind of circumstances. <br><br>The gravity of how I feel and how I am proceeding clashing at times with certain kind of spiritual specifically today and yesterday in subtle fashion and seemingly non-violent especially given the discernment that has been discerned regarding certain kind of ceasefires at least for the moment. It was like a certain spiritual showed up with impact and live, heightened energies as well as seemingly trying to go certain directions that we had already previously tried to go in the past in which at times did not work out although infused with moderate success. At the end of the day though it does still seem that some of those directions reemployed. The problematic is partially that before some of this arrived seemingly there was a variable instilled of not necessarily mistrust but rather an uncomfortable kind of uncertainty. There was a tell earlier of this that there might be situations where I feel I need to make my voice be heard but rather than it be physical because lets be honest I have spoken in my own process physically near point to that in which certain spiritual get upset and even on the eve of the past couple of weeks of the kind of channel mishaps. I am going with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated and it is emphasized throughout this life regardless of what my other dimensional selves in regards to this life choose behind the scenes. I felt that certain knowledge regarding this process needed to be seen by a portion of the spiritual that had been around this morning especially early morning because it puts perspective as to where I am t in this process in which has been changed to certain degree and it is worth it. Look at the reasonings as to why it was still worth it even if I am still on a different wave length. Anti-Camp kind of style and re pour emergence in which lets be honest the good and bad working together might not be the worst thing in the world but it also brought a flavor that some have been trying to suppress in which makes no sense to be honest given how many spiritual like that direction. The healing regarding myself was not only needed from a personal perspective to be true but also from others perspectives and it did create good will. There has been leeway and access as well as belief in regards to being able to pursue something in which should be allowed, that being able to pursue intimacy with spiritual on opposite sides of line consentually in what one wants to experience which again has been popular. <br><br>A lot of different tells, some of which for some of them have been of them have been in this process before. I had discerned multiple different kinds of dimensional maneuverings happen at the same time which seemed to lend to confusion but that in which the good had a handle on.<br><br>Spiritual facilitating interaction in stellar fashion, channeling clean and nice, infrastructure and deployment regarding demeanor definitely noted in the civility that has been through the channel.<br><br>There also was a variable of sleeping spirit in form of not remembering certain variables that they might consider to be important to direction but there is also lost spiritual in which i am discerning at times to be creating anxiety but also notes of importance to situate in letting to the other good.<br><br>Jobs for those spiritual that are receiving turbulence and lack of occupation. What can Earth-Based Societal and the others that my Main Spirit Guides relayed do to be able to replace and create jobs especially regarding those affected by way of some of the changes taking place currently. Severance packages with greed coverage plans. <br><br>There has been moments where certain time discernment has quickened regarding certain other dimensional time where I am even able to discern quick movements but then there are others where the quick movements are en mass for entire peoples where centuries and millennia if not way more time because there has been larger insinuations of certain time passing in other dimensional, some of which has been in line with physical interaction that was changed to reflect time passing quickly. 10 or 15 solid time frames noted within the past five years where this kind of phenomenon has happened. Certain spiritual been working on overreaction partially upon seeing some of the small shit not worth the salt or resources and the kind of overblown, certain kind have done what they can at times but multiple have felt that it needs to receive sweet endings. Because seriously.<br><br>Hear from my Main Spirit Guides and the lists they indicated in regards to informational placement if possible and I do feel some of the direction regarding has been good.<br><br>quality of life for those that my Main Spirit Guides relayed. (working on novel)<br>Safety of side rooms upon side hustle and the other kinds because we have noted that there is a way to proceed with trying to view certain information but also other things in which to be true I have discerned mostly good.<br><br>Addiction<br>OCD<br>Hoarders<br>agoraphobic<br><br>Other selves that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and physically I do hold it down in a capacity for them if they are manipulated in regards to what they are going with but their Main Spirit Guides also hold it down for a certain amount of them as well as in a certain manner.<br><br>Those that help certain manner like when you walk past them on the street. There is a more intense of this,when certain kind walk another emerges, says that your gonna be ok and when you meet a stranger on the street, spiritual will help you through them. <br><br>Some trying to create similarimlar impact from my process only on my family anaswell as life utilization variable and potential others. <br><br>That green seen and work technology being life utilization variable that I did not but some said its a certain kind but the problematic is some of the innocense in the mix. <br>Theethree things are from an earlier seen at tim hortons , high impact<br></div>
