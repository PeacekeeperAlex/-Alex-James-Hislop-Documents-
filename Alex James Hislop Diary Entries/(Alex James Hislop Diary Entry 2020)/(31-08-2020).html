<div class="title">(31-08-2020)</div>
<div class="content"> The good arriving yesterday in multiple fashion again feeling uncomfortable. Certain kinds of culture around and it almost seemed like some sort of tournament while today seem to be more of an air show. I felt attacked yesterday but I am kind of tried of saying that on these diary entries to be true. I think something huge was done yesterday and even while some of the things they have been trying to do to cause me to be more intense, over and done, I have continued to retain on my end a certain kind of interaction that still speaks of coherency. <br><br>There has been some trying to say I am more extreme that what some think. It`s been an MO at times and it was done in aesthetic with good saving days previous but we knew there was going to be more too it than that from those days or at least some of us thought so. <br><br>26th - Warriors, Combatants and Heroes<br>27th - Deleted Diary entry day and labelment of certain spiritual saving. It was a really good day until the end of the day on my end. <br>28th - That strange sort of segway between more extreme groups and also classic societal authority types upon my interaction. I remember a scout archetype utilization in trouble but also a certain moment where it felt like medics were in vicinity in action. It brought up this point of moments where there might be a group under duress where medical is seen more prominently while others need help and then a switch where the other groups that needs help receives. <br>29th - Talking about beginnings and the need to talk about different kinds of larger topics supposedly thought to be larger. The end of the day on this day what the shit was going on it was this scene from my office where I could really feel conflict and turbulence taking place in prominent fashion. discussions of endings days previous subtle and then talked about more this day and the next. Generations spoken of as well in which on my end seems more emphasized in regards to the next day and the day after although generations still spoken of in certain manners on this and previous. The war and battle in regards to my life brought up in certain fashion. <br>30th - Continued desire of me to talk about endings and beginnings. Certain systems that reminded of another day previous even spoken and talked a bout as such regarding interaction systems that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There was a certain kind of emphasis regarding ways of proceeding pertaining to the call being made in a certain sense having to do with beginnings and endings. Vent areas and system placement upon me. There was talk of the third person kind where certain spiritual are able to look away when I speak physically. Vent area and ways of life facilitation. There was mention of suits and at times it did feel like a funeral. There was moments of creation yesterday and on my end it felt to be a therapy kind and a justification story line fit. Either way I did note cleaning happening but also emergence when talking about different pop culture. It was a different interaction for some than the usual street cleaning. Even some of the single items in the house were put to the test in certain manners and as to why some were letting know of some of the situations and why it mattered Expand on vent areas and ways of life facilitation and creation as well as some of the disappearing. What it is I have been discerning regarding this, quickly, a bigger dimensional more in front of the scenes moving through and cleaning in front of the scenes dimensional with utilization of technology. I discern industry. There has been notings of discomfort and how some of them set it up in which I feel is the smaller percentage of this grouping of dimensional that moved through yesterday and for portions still here today (31st of august), has been in fashions more in line with certain kinds of darker gaming and atrocities. What one experiences regarding can matter. There was an awareness from one of the bigger beings discerned yesterday when I would speak throughout the day and of course there was decent let knows regarding a few things but I would want to rather say what my Main Spirit Guides chose for me to say on such interaction systems. There was let knows as to why some have continued to channel through at times though and that certain regular let knows I have been doing linked to such. Karmic interactions happening yesterday as well as. Something was undone and there was family matters on this day with darker kind of family letting know of attacking me.<br>31st - On the move but also stationary in trying to get spiritual to understand that it is both and that I am of both in certain manners. A play on Authority and Non-Authority today and a breakthrough in understanding that there are those trying to help in regards to direction and also other circumstances in the tough decisions that exists. Dreams in the morning, joy rides that reminded of the colour storyline where blue was reckless driving. <br>Something about colours these days too in which might have to do with previous conversations about some of the storylines regarding colour. Only it was with a certain spiritual that reminded of square. There was a subtle that I might have been with brothers and sisters and yet I could still see myself in third person in certain moments. It was like we were jumping dimensional sections of a certain dimensional area. There was sky and we jumping through photos or 3 dimensional shapes.<br>Healing of Storylines regarding Canada and America.<br>Continued trying to alleviate what had happened this past ten days regarding certain over with situations but also a perception emergence on my end in stronger fashion than it`s been in the past for what`s acceptable regarding societal ability to intermingle associate and mention myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides. Floating heavens with clean air discerned in a certain fashion as well.<br>Some tried to attack my sentimental past couple too. The gravity of the 29th and the 27th should be understood along with early morning 30th but one of the key things throughout all of this has been the grouping of regulars and other kinds that have safeguarded multiple routes and have continued to let know that it is not as bad as it seems and coupled with my let knows that it is not as bad as it seems is starting to rival the darker let knows. You factor in spiritual information for portions and it also does the job of reasuring.<br><br>The importance of what my Main Spirit Guides indicated for myself and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) especially in this discerned direction of utilization regarding myself these past couple months. We see months previous and then things really heat up. <br><br><br><br>The at what point these past five days in going certain kinds of routes like pure morality in was certain kind of operating and if need be just going pure morality. I have said it before in regards but it really kind of hit home again in regards to pursuing lifestyles different even though I already identify with some of them and are going routes in same styles. It was just one of those where I looked at what my life is and how I am proceeding. Something scared some of the bad days previous in what was said around here, something was told and it changed perspective there too.  <br>One of the big ones had to do with what some were saying this place is and the kind of opportunity being overblown and changed as to what it used to be what we have to remember is that forecasts did have a gauge in regards to direction of this place in which portions changed at times as is normal.<br><br></div>
