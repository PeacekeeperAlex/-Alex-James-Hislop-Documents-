<div class="title">(09-09-2020) &quot;The Third Sandwich&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>They have talked about different spiritual cultural emergence before in the past with kings and queens of the age and looks of high royalty but also ways of proceeding with situations that would unfold spiritually at times within certain dimensional existence. Certain kind of suppression of power in different means in which I even commented in being able to set ones own power level being one of the smartest abilities to have. There had been a thing about it today and more discussion of gaming. Some trying to label me not as powerful as some think, both good and bad to be true from what I have seen but I was also one not to worry about my power level in a certain sense but on another level it matters more greatly than some consider. When we talk of other in regards to this context it seems paramount.<br><br>Continued strongarming and threatening in the face of some who are not listening to such things anylonger given the caseworks and results as well as the reviews regarding such processes. I know I looked at it from a certain perspective and that doesn&#39;t mean that certain kind can&#39;t walk away because I can walk away too if I wanted too. The tone I get though is that many don&#39;t feel what I have done within my life or what other kinds have done within their lives warrant the kind of expense and non-involvement and that isn&#39;t to say there shouldn&#39;t be expense and non-involvement. There is a plan in place and I had wondered if the magic that was truly known to exist regarding was being seen in which some said before my very eyes in other dimensional and spiritual. The long forms my mother would fill for belle wondered to have partially been for me until it was revealed that it was supposedly less to do with me and more to do with my sister in her own extraordinary. At what point did I feel spiritual utilizing this as manipulation to steer direction. There were peoples and spiritual in which I can only go so far in shoutout fashion at times that never wanted to not be able to experience the things in which the taste and enjoyment supped in desired ways and only wanted to experience that kind from hear on out. Did I understand the kind of paperwork involved in situating this life? Did I fully understand as to why it needed to be situated in such manners? It was one of those moments where it looked like I was jumping the line but I had wondered how true that really was with all of those schooling days of remembrance of being in line. Down here it some how seemed to muddy the water with the kind of stuff forced to experience in other dimensional even if cordial and decent still scared why I wouldn&#39;t be kind of expression existence. I could reconcile the way I have proceeded in multiple existences and have in which is seen and understood to be a supporting role but what were some of the other cast of Characters regarding this story and my story. It seemed to be lost in translation until it wasn&#39;t ever lost in translation. Hardline kind of sell to the android in which he sometimes doesn&#39;t buy. Meaning that the Android tries to correct that it both can&#39;t and can be lost in translation and both be that at the same time but in a literal scientific manner it can&#39;t both be, lost in translation and wasn&#39;t ever lost in translation at the same time in literalation Fact but could be considered as such by way of other same terminology and different terminology by way of existence in certain reality upon considerment. Some ask why it that I explain that in the manner that I did and there for sure is better articulation existent. My answer would be to give a tell in regards to certain things within this process that has been getting remedied on such scale as just in case. It was the kind of feeling that is on the move jitterbug kind of feeling of proportion upon on a story that has seen heights on this planet in subtle respectable fashion and when you have an awareness like mine at times coupled with the other variables it creates center points and process markers even making event listings prophesized in the past. How small it truly is was pointed out earlier in ways in which didn&#39;t comprehend the direction that I was talking about for if possibilities list that remedy across the board be true to exist and as one of those that have been advocating for use of such remedy in safe and logical manners I feel both cold and comfortable through life in waiting. Of average person especially for in other places the regular are so for reasons different than what some think in a misunderstood thought having to do with conflict rather than what it truly was for the Guideship was understood in direction that reflected it be understood to be different than previously assumed and even me with kind of good spiritual let know and defense that it has been in the past 20 days and even within conversations of getting it to be understood to be of such culture and understanding other lenses as such within what I find acceptable in the Light and Original Setting for what I consider myself to be in the Light and Original with spiritual guideship discretion advised. At what point has that already been shouted from the Rooftops in the kind of Journeying that has been happening on this Earth. Shadow movements of our lives not only through our own anatomical but also from other selves in other dimensional being vindicated for being here as the good continues to arrive in meeting response for some of the vagabonds that have been in proximity in the interaction situating game of life and need be understood other kinds that my Main Spirit Guides relayed. Movements in front of the scenes like quick spiritual movement in one physical second and interaction taking place that physicals are not fully noting in quick moments. Imagine days worth of interactions with spiritual you care about and interactions reflecting that you have other families in many different fashions. Friends and interactions more reflecting Dragon Ball Z and other gaming aesthetics regarding a classic look for some of it but not all of it. Some of it might be more biblical realism and then again there is also modern technology kinds of looks upon these spiritual and other dimensional interactions.<br><br>This taking out of context of other culture and being more aggressive in that direction has been seen before. It seems to be one that some try to emulate at times but I don&#39;t think this is fully the truth with the amount of movement of Good and True, not emulation up to a point but for some a style employed. At what point does it become too confucia to be able to mentally articulate what is needed to be understood in knowing terms for what one considers oneself to be. At what point does the form utilization in which might have been the lesser issue for some but rather the memories utilization and life experience utilization rather to be the bigger need be understood for where that line lies and what deserves situating of distress in which shouldn&#39;t become dusty in the cupboard. Not some lone soldier walk home in the cold. Not worse prospects to shoehorn the punishment alternative type to the mouthpiece jones of what one found truly acceptable. They had said earlier that I needed the voice and that it most import to understand vent interactions as well as that there were more likely other in the likes of the voice itself in which relayed Leadership of Team. The realization that somebody the spirits sandwich today had spurred thought to maybe make a third final sandwich in which the dog or any other party wasn&#39;t at fault.<br><br>Tip:<br>If I feel like not writing, finding a themes or topic to start instead in which can help. Sometimes it can feel like there isn&#39;t much to write about but you can pick past Diary Entries for more topics to expand upon, <br><br>Jamie, they keep trying to say that energies that are around her like that one where she is smoking and looking off into the distance but one in regards to the stars, keeps coming around me. There have been other kinds of energy remembrance and utilization but also emulation in the kinds different than I have been able to describe but at what point do I not mention you anymore anyhow? and I haven&#39;t mentioned as much as what some said and in fact it was the spirit that was getting hurt more than I when they tormented me about you. They came up some conspiracy theory said to have helped you in the ways that some said that you were more powerful than me and that it was in fact somehow some kind of pop culture favoritism that was reason and that somehow chicken scratch of beautiful compared between Drama and Authority but was it really Societal and Leadership, was that the romance of certain spiritual doing things in direction of itself and those of entertainment and popularity contrast. I feel she would rather not have me talk about her in a certain sense and I haven&#39;t to be true and of course it&#39;s intertwined with sometimes those moments where I do feel like speaking about her or towards her and it has less to do with what some thought in the kind of love discerned and maybe more to do with something else family related in the kind of relationship I have with her physically. The real truth is that the spirit have brought up her archetype and form as well as mention of her in what I associate with the name Jamie to the degree unacceptable that has less to do with me in a certain sense and they sometimes spoke of the drugs.<br><br><br>Themes:<br>#Direction #Choice #Chosen #Seen #Understood #Physical #Society #Spiritual #RippleAffect #Decisions #Partying #Vacation #InteractionSmooth #Safe #TellsOfDanger #Overblown #Exageration #Realism #Realization #LivingLifeWhileOthersSuffer #SufferSituated #Truth #Intervention #IT #Writing</div>
