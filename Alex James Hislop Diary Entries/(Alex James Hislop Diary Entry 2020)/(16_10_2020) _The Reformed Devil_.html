<div class="title">(16/10/2020) &quot;The Reformed Devil&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I had noted a shaping that exists that reminds of multiple characteristics not all from the same person that some are indicating, for what&#39;s acceptable. Some said this person was bad but I think the truth denotes especially if we are looking at archetype purposes and I get female connotations but also leadership vibes. Reminds of Red Story and a care for Red story but also story and realism. Ferocity and care. Reminds of God in certain manners and reminds of that kinds of dark look off to the side for situating. There had a been storyline involving the devil where God saved the devil. I don&#39;t think it was the only storyline in letting know that Story beings should be able to control their own story especially upon clarifications but that also that there is different kinds of story being some of which quite normal, heck I have spoken of that in certain sense. It shouldn&#39;t just pertain to free form. I didn&#39;t know if some of this archetype that I am describing was a part of my Authorities in certain manner but my Main Spirit Guides knew and considering how much I rely upon through my Main Spirit Guides, I felt that should be enough. There was a day where I took a walk and had my Canadian Sunglasses on, where I had said that 100% Safe adaptable story systems exist so I didn&#39;t need to worry as much what some were insinuating which didn&#39;t mean i wasn&#39;t realistic. It seemed like this spiritual I had discerned on my end lending towards archetype perception on my end and others was saving some of the bad but that there was something that some wanted to be understood that it wasn&#39;t the only thing. I felt there was tiredness that some wanted me to let know of and that a healing would be beneficial specifically with still being able let know of being tired. That look I told of earlier in the situating and intense as well as dark energies around also reminded of Memnoch. Do you know how I thought this reminded of Memnoch? I looked at a wood grain on my wall. It reminded me of a title from a book so said fictional. I thought he was good even though i knew there was something dark about him but the reason he left was compassion based upon trying to help humanity but also others in the misery seen.I just happened to finally read a bit of premise of that book and it said that he wasn&#39;t bad but rather good and left for some reason having to do with compassion upon misery. There was a Human emphasis on my end for some of the story emergence as I am a physical human on this earth but maybe his form spoke of something else, Animals. There was also a subtle tell about space within the shaping the I saw and it spoke of protecting God from Space but also that space is good and that perception regarding mattered near as much as truth and that there were many Good Gods in Space which is why we wonder why it is that God at times had to deal with what he did. It reminded me of my process in some of the bad things that had taken place earlier and somehow the good arriving now in large amounts. The explanation of memory and how it worked scientifically was important. There was another storyline having to do with doctors and brimstone look upon them in knowing that brimstone can be good, I surmised it was similar to the look upon certain detectives higher up on this planet having to do with apes but rather different and a different kind. It was like God was battling something through Doctors but had less to do with battle? In a certain context but maybe also not so. There was tech use these days by way of certain kind utilizing archetypal in which is normal where it spoke of the requests from physicians of the past. Memnoch reminded of Physicians and of course the classic compassion the common rabble have cried out to be from physicians. Did Memnoch have to do battle on the same side as Compassion in the epitome of partially defined him. He might have been saving bad and pulling anti-camp decent measures for what was understood was that the quality of life for bad was also impacting the good. Misery could still be facilitated near as good if not better than the real thing which is also why Memnoch might be angry at times in relaying such a fact while being miserable. Literal energy placement of aesthetics similar to what one discerns misery to be without having to feel certain kinds of misery but also in certain systems there were those who could still experience what some might consider classic misery given context. It wasn&#39;t just about misery though. It was also about suffering and other kinds in which, the tell again had been that some higher up could facilitate not only suffering but as well as other kinds in ways within moral parameters. <br><br>I know the title can pertain to more than just what I have described thus far and does and there will be more writing but there is also spiritual writing regarding this diary entry and there is realism in naming journal day titles and diary entry day titles. There is more too it and can be pertain to words as well. For example, the Ram. A project that seemed to be done with God and the Devil. The Ram protects lambs. It reminded of Horns on the Giselle. A bit of a tell. They though were pointing upwards in a shoutout to Plato at times. The kinder and gentler of the past. Where the Rams might have pointing towards the past to save but in fashion where cover remained. <br><br>The new panatone at the end of pananutone. Nutone from the light switch and panatone the classic. <br><br>I saw symbols on the street written by spray paint, I dont know which phenomenon that I have been noting regarding this is responsible but one of the ones I hadn&#39;t fully listed had been a certain kind of smooth channelling and other kinds pf psychictivity combined in which has the ability to maneuver physicals in small motions, a hand wave, a smile as well as other kinds. One thing I spoke of is noting psychictivty more janky and crooked turning smooth and more together like multiple kinds of dimensional are forming up creating advanced psychictivity that was once more separate. I had been noting signs sometimes related to my process in what I have noted showing up on sidewalks, not just spray paint but other kinds as well. Some of the spray paint symbols:<br><br>L | M<br>S | S<br>L | P<br>M | M<br>G | S<br>? <br>Different variations of M showing up at first upon first notice from myself after let knows of the brits and a certain kind of battle taking place. More in front of the scenes dimensional. Though figured out to symbolize more than what some though, on that day, I felt there to be connection. In Action might have been the tell rather than missing. Today we started seeing Shapes of triangles on the street near me, couple different ones. Another tell was a thanking of front line heroes and thanking of heroes, blue and tan. A symbol near salvation army, one might have been older than the other. Tan on the left, black on the right where it looked like someone tried smudging. This has coincided with the mentalist detective kind of walk that has been happening as of late as well as the kind of way I used to discern story changing in a certain manner but still here to a certain extent.<br><br>Easy<br>18/0<br>Showing up on a spoon.<br><br>Browne<br>Showing up on a spoon.<br><br>Physical Metals appearing in my mouth, the first one felt like a physical god put it there. The second happening today in what looked like silver, near same size as the last described, colour changing in my room happening again instead of soothsaying cards that used to have gold trim turned silver and then gold again. <br><br>Important updates.<br>Early morning depiction of October 17th, 2020.<br>What I needed to write in regards to this sentence.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------<br><br>Birds with a certain Commonality, the average joe kind of birds. There was a conversation the reminded when I had first started to looking for staves and sunglasses, specifically business sunglasses, you know the day where I wrote Faith on that napkin. Talked about Professor and Professor Hislop.
