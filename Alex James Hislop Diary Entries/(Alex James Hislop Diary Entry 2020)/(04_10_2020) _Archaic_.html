<div class="title">(04/10/2020) &quot;Archaic&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>If I had never incarnated before this life, then this shits over. Because anything bad done in regards to me so said not from this life makes no damn sense and if it had anything to do with this life then you don&#39;t want it to be. Now in certain areas that don&#39;t fly but if I stayed in the light the entire time before this life then it sure as shit does. And I did incarnate from the light. This is Alex James Hislop the Physical Human saying this. My Legal is strong in this life for a reason. I have not done the wrong some said and I have continued to operate with self-defense, defense of my own that my Main Spirit Guides indicated as well as others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) and I have continued to say to set my interaction the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated as well as the others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated by many different means both spiritually and physically. There has been tells though that I do have other selves in which are innocent by way of what their Guideships relayed, now if it&#39;s from this life that&#39;s one thing but if it&#39;s from other lives than that is potentially another tell in which are also innocent by way of what their Guideships relayed. Because of Higher Spiritual direction as well as other directions for not going far enough, I myself can only go so far and being in the physical as well limits my ability too, in being able to go far enough. Why would it be that certain people and spiritual are angry. I am a part of my Guideship in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Setting. There is way more trust than what some were insinuating down here at times as some didn&#39;t have a shitting clue about it. The same damn reason I listed for not being able to go far enough is why certain spiritual and people in this physical as well as spiritual regarding can only go so far and then when you factor the other situations also limited their ability at times to be able to fully defend in the ways they desired. This a let know of some of the Defense in regards to the Natural spiritual and Other-dimensional in regards to this Space and Physical. I take breaks. We that my Main Spirit Guides indicated take breaks and we do so in the manners that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Maybe some of this has to do with some of the experiences I experienced in this life and if I didn&#39;t get attacked, then by way of going with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Setting, there is less of a problem. Live Actions still exist though and those blocking Guideship information from making it through to the areas needed should be on notice to a certain extent. Certain kind don&#39;t want to be attacking myself in regards to this life but even more so you don&#39;t want to attack the other physicals on this planet, it&#39;s like I said I might not be the most powerful on this planet and they have screwed up less than me in manners that reflect near 100% if not so in the physical. Innocent people living their lives. Innocent Animals living their lives. Innocent insects living their lives. Innocent Planet living it&#39;s life. Innocent Star living it&#39;s life. Real life being lived even if their is a gaming spin spiritually and through physical. Waking up in the middle of the night from attack supposedly as a let know to save is sometimes more of a pretty sight than thought and there are other ways different than attack to get ones attention but don&#39;t underestimate those that are getting attacked in which are not receiving help. Don&#39;t underestimate legal when blocking someone from saving another. Don&#39;t think that&#39;s the ethical boundary of the past. Those that do so technically speaking don&#39;t have the moral high ground but really it extends to something else like highest direction to be true for circumstance. At what point measure did the tracks laying down by the POWs and the rest be the one to tackle, the answer was when everyone pointed towards such a thing in moment of Goliath understanding. Somehow in this process David was labelled the bad guy at times but there was a point where both David and Goliath were on my side and it might be so. Archaic is the being in charge of moral direction during the first age. The first age does include the beginning in which the length of time is told by my Main Spirit Guides. Just as Archaic was in charge of moral direction during the first age, Arion is in charge of moral direction during the fourth age and Arion was and still is in certain capacities a part of Archaic. It had less to do with David though and more to do with Archaic. He wasn&#39;t the bad guy either but rather the Eldest Spirit for true upon some of the strongest clarifications. Guidance relayed. I remember that I wanted to bring up my former mentor Avadar and even one of my monikers Arcon in the mention of the previous name. I still cared about interesting which makes sense but maybe understanding situations might be better but I liked who I am. It reminded of God in a certain sense even with the power he wields I feel he still cared about interesting too but only up to a rounded point. At what point clamor for Archaic. It did remind of the awakening earlier of good sensibility in reminding for the luster of life. These energies I could feel rivaling monotone in the bringing fourth of both joy in the former at times but also decent in the latter if done correctly. Old men dancing is what they said for the kind winning that took place but a mourning brighter than the sunitself for only if it could be true on a day that it wasn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t fully understand the colour of mourning but I surmised at times that it was many color. It was David the White holding it down at times for Archaic in front the scenes for that wisdom known to be but showing up for David the Grey never seemed easier than today. The Stand had been calling at times these past couple days and I couldn&#39;t help but notice more clamor. Music creating at times, the kind of battery life created when we love to music has been one of the greatest things I have learned in this life. Elastic Heart and Bittersweet Symphony. The It Factor remains motivated. The inspiration created fueled the motivation but we needed the artists to be inspired too. Their voices heard but with the feeling that we all knew music told of. It was sometimes that good church bell motivated for those that needed in a world of genre lending to the mainstream. Dimensional Music tracks as well as other kinds through music discerned. Dimensional Movie tracks as well as other kinds through film discerned. Vindication taking place through finally regarding multiple psychic machinisms. Awareness awakening. Clarity. I thought it might have to do with Psychological and the kind of process of in hopes of being employed in a psychology content I want to create today. I had identified a really amazing thing that people do at times in regards to their lives. The shrines people create for themselves in the den of their mind upon the things grouped together, feather and crystals with incense burning the signal. I would ask Psychology, Why did people create these shrines?<br><br>Show up for David the grey. Five for fighting scare on the walk and then battle of gods getting bigger in the background. Voices in the songs manifest. Messages against me but also for me. Experience creation and maintenance.<br><br>Let know of some of the changes I am noting in the digital earth-based physical internet regarding other-dimensional and spiritual. That I feel was a good landing regarding good spiritual and good other-dimensional upon Earth-Based facilitating in which does have good spiritual and other-dimensional gal civ tones. Also film and music both I feel receiving updates in overlaps as well as good changes. How do I explain in regards to that in which operate pertaining to technological deployment itineraries that want to space out technological deployment? Thought machinsisms situated and me as well as others vindicated. It felt a spiritual grabbed hold of certain thought machinisms as well as thoughts and mentality. I was able to clarify multiple points with english through the machinism and it looked like the thought infrastructure got situated. There was also kind of seriousness in regards to this process as well as others I feel regarding legal matters. I felt the presence of lawyers. On my end there was a certain good spiritual maneuver into vicinity partially by way of how some have responded in regards to this process at times in the past and spoke candidly about some of my situation as well as letting know of certain things that helped regarding this process and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>- old man waking up and talking of intrigue culture<br>- <br><br>There was this storyline that somehow I was trying to utilize that good spiritual depicted within NDE culture and what Near Death Experiences preach at times akin to NDE Researches, psychics and spiritualists on this planet preach. There was this look from blue alliance as well as others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated at times but also not so in multiple manners for when I try to to help the bad. It made sense for some of it why I partially went to that good spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated but also understanding it wasn&#39;t just that classic descripted in the previous sentence but included multiple kinds of others and it was the Loners, hermits and directions that disliked that in which I probably needed to identify to facilitate more so than what I had been trying to say the entire time in how I like many different kinds of spiritual and wanted to facilitate them regarding my process in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated but it was apart of it. I did it in my own fashion though, some I didn&#39;t want in this process anymore by way of what has happened and also lent towards why I was going to that good spiritual that my main Spirit Guides indicated. I had acknowledged that I wasn&#39;t the only one facilitating my process and in fact probably was facilitating less compared to some in which did bring up the thought that I could facilitate it alone from Higher Light and Original Setting given the leeway needed. Going to the good that my Main Spirit Guides indicated had to do with going to those more ethical than what has been present in some of the good at times that had been in my process. More akin to the kind of ethical regarding my own physical societal but also the spiritual societal that my Main Spirit Guides indicated as well as Archaic. Some might point towards Archaic Morality in understanding Morality and History as a relaying.<br><br>I saw symbolism on a book about pez dispenser. (Days before, maybe a day before)<br><br>I pursued meditation and found one of the best vibrational notes at the end of om chanting by meditation mind. I was able to identify how to raise vibration earlier in this process but applied this day near the end of the day. I try to do loving vibration infused with the tone of vibration. I also tried to emphasize glowing light through my physical hands. I felt a culture of Om around me. One of the sacred chants on this earth. I had forgotten the power of meditation but I didn&#39;t fully be able to meditate for the length of times that I had wanted. *List the Jedi meditation that I had learned earlier, that doing meditation with colours in regards to cross legged sitting on bed in bedroom. Maybe more of a personal spin but there might be something even more sacred regarding the sitting cross legged on floor on mat.* I felt a flourish of activity from the spirit. I felt lighter. I didn&#39;t worry about lower vibrational spirit partially because there was let know of transportation to higher areas and I also didn&#39;t literally worry which is why letting know of different styles of writing, like being able to write that I was worried without literally creating worrying energies felt to be important even though many understood. I still felt worried at times though more of like a air kind of feeling regarding. I felt like higher vibrations took place elsewhere as well potentially on earth. There was some sort of metaphorical and ripple effect impact regarding in which felt to be good by way of how I operated today. I was also though worried about if there was moments later where I did lash out, but less so by way of the change taking place, again another variable regarding new earth and what has been labelled as the event in certain spiritualist communities across Earth-Based. There seems to be something happening, I am fairly certain.<br><br>Preserving dry culture that had requested if possible, advocationals.<br>Preserving friendships upon some of the changes taking place. <br>Personal advocations regarding those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this sentence.<br><br>Don&#39;t mistaken it people as well as spiritual, there seems to be a War taking place at times regarding some of the things taking place and it might have to do with the fact that there was a War regarding some of the lack of changes that were taking place coupled with change from before. I had noted multiple things today that made me feel uneasy, some of it to not be true relaying certain other-dimensional truth and symbolism regarding that truth.<br><br>There is a list of Guideships that my Main Spirit Guides in the Original Setting regarding how to proceed in regards to my process in the capacities that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Setting. It&#39;s sometimes difficult to facilitate exactly what my Main Spirit Guides indicated and the informational doesn&#39;t always make it through in certain areas. Those closing communications on purpose to go these routes on notice though because the directions that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Setting do matter and they can and have made realistic in front of the scenes choices for portions. Again, consulting morality ethical in front of the scenes is a good way to proceed with this process.<br><br>Talk of desire culture and intrigue culture. * Just a paragraph.\<br>\t <br>where i had been standing outside and there was talkingofv5 scripts as well as storyline in regards to certain kind ofv5 agencies physical fv5or som6e on this planet earth let know ofv5 guideship clarifv5ications would be decent. went to backyard to stand on tim6e stone and sit one pro m6ix bag. this was alsoa let know ofv5 som6ething taking place in the light and battle fv5or gam6ing as well. i rem6em6ber being tired when gonig to sleep and som6ething about fv5am6ily and m6y m6other.Story was on the m6ov5e on this da in good ways and there was difv5fv5erent talking point on m6y laww,Ir l i rem6em6ber being tired upon going to bed and then ofv5 course ifv5 i didwake up early would lend towards tired and taling about hershey kiss and the trying ofv5 leav5ing the hershey kiss to be transported.pil hma<br>#It&#39;sNotEasyBeingMeSong #DavidTheGrey #FiveForFighting #TheScientist #Science #Desire #Intrigue #Wisdom #TheFatMerchentStrikesAgain #Shakespeare #IntrigueCulture #Comedy #Saving #Music #MIB #Police #Jams #Theatrics #Love #Truth #CivilDiscussions #Happy #Wins #SacredFacilitationWithinConfinesFromThatGoodSpiritual #TimeSituating </div>
