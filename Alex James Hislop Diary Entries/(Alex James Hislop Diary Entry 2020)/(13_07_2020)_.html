<div class="title">(13/07/2020) </div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I woke up with dreams, a breaking bad style kind of frame but subdued. I was in outside a library yesterday and I felt that my friends were there. Searching. Laid back. Images of people I remember in this life and some of which I don&#39;t. There was something dreamy about the dream. Something to do with transportation. It was like there was need but not so either. Something about the sick. Something about that earlier culture around me, flatliners kind of culture, but they pointed towards the dry. These dream this day though again seen imagery of people that had been in my life and are in my life for some. There was more to do this dream and felt to be an extension of yesterdays dream but something was different. Searching. It seems to be repeated at times throughout dreams. Dreamland lost and found. It reminded me of how powerful dimensions can be. I thought I dreamed of the circus but I think it was a memory different. Impressional memories and memories of imagery I don&#39;t fully remember experiencing, I know I have been to the circus but I think it was a different circus. <br><br>We have spoken about interaction with movies before. The idea to set my impact, ripple affect and interaction a certain manner in regards to the films themselves in which can yield a better artistry at times given leeway upon what the Artist decides. There is other styles that can be just as beneficial if not more so. Some of the interaction setting is for artistic purposes. Some of it my interaction was really set that way in a hardline approach regarding certain films but others take a softer approach at times. Utilization of overlaps and dimensional fan fiction can be utilized to let loose at times and I think it can be beneficial in facilitating experiences regarding film especially in helping opportunity specifically for different types. I thought the darker facilitation utilizing fan fiction technology with chance to be in the film can be useful given the Artist preferences but it can also be utilized in many other ways to benefit a film. So for example, I watch a movie and the actions and non-actions throughout watching that film that I do being changed and mapped down to reflect specific variables agreed upon between by my Main Spirit Guides, the Spiritual Guideships of those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and the Authorities that my Main Spirit Guides indicated as well as the Artist&#39;s vision that my Main Spirit Guides relayed. So while I might watch a movie and do certain actions in which are not considered to be a part of the ripple affect and impact regarding such a film, they can consult what actions it actually was considered to impact the film in manners in which the Artist intended. For my impact in regards to Earth-Based filmaking and truly it could be for other kinds of Earth-Based Art as well as, we can choose from an actions catalog and Non-Actions Catalog obviously given context for the kinds of actions and non-actions in which I and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated can mimic in higher light, remember what the physical spiritualist communities on this planet espouse, on this planet we talk of Good and enlightenment, there is nothing wrong with heaven being in our films for what we consider heaven to be given context. Couldn&#39;t some of the interaction setting be considered a certain Cinematic Interaction overlap buffer.The expanded of the story might involve heaven and interactions that are taking place. How some have tried to view this process needs to be remembered what exactly physical earth-based spirituality is speaking about.  But understand for some, that that darker culture exists. Providing Hell with opportunities to be within film might be one of the best ideas on this planet. God and the Devil. It&#39;s one of the Greatest Earth-Based storylines to be true. The film itself is brilliant and to be true there is many but sometimes it does involve Hollywood. What&#39;s the Metaphorical and film of that Metaphorical. Directors deal with many different interactions at times within some of their films and it&#39;s why there is such a thing as buffer and mediation spiritually. On the subject of Buffer. <br><br>It extends beyond this idea for what I was thinking about. I had a thought about setting my interaction. I am a physical on this physical planet earth. There is physical interaction at times with other physicals and other-dimensional regarding other physicals on this planet but also other kinds in regards to my Physical life and spiritual life. For a certain portion if not all of my other-dimensional interaction that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, I thought of a simplistic way to proceed. Do remember that there is other buffer and overlaps protecting and keeping spiritual and people safe, you need only look at the famous on this planet physically and the spiritual interaction regarding some of the Hollywood Programs of interaction throughout regular life. <br><br>Some of the spiritual events that have taken place and what has been understood and known by way of different communications sometimes subtle in nature especially upon explaining why it needs to be subtle. Some of which might have to do with my life impact and ripple affect upon general populace regarding Earth-Based and others. Consent matters. and in regards to physicals on this physical planet earth, Spiritual Guideship especially Main Spiritual Guideship is an Authority on this planet and physically in regards to spirituality it might be the biggest reference to Spiritual Authorities in the ways that the Main Spirit Guides of Earth-Based Authority relayed and for some if not all of Earth-Based Authority they&#39;re Main Spirit Guides are defined by their Main Spirit Guides in the Original Setting. <br><br>Think of two tier buffer system in regards to process interaction regarding my impact and ripple affect as well as other kinds created from other selves in other dimensional. I have a spiritual that my Man Spirit Guides indicated in which can split in however many manners in the Billions and Trillions. This is to be done consentually in regards to this spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. (Insert Name) The idea was for those physicals on this physical planet Earth that had wanted a certain kind of interaction buffer, not emphasized in taking the hit but rather emphasized in regards to setting my interaction, ripple affect and others kinds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to the life stationed upon. Hidden away at times to reveal upon certain moments throughout and sometimes I am there in proximity and vicinity in that context seen openly throughout the life depending on the process and what was agreed upon. <br><br>The second buffer is there for certain kind of spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated to hold down this life in regards to my physical ripple affect and impact and other kinds agreed upon throughout the life stationed but in Areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, some of which I am unable to traverse. They go to other areas where I am unable to go at times and it should be considered a grouping of spiritual per life for simplistic purposes but understanding there is more complicated regarding some of this should be understood. Again, the emphasis is that my Physical Life should not be causing ill will and other kinds upon the life in which this is stationed. There is parts of Earth-Based Physicals that have opted out completely regarding either but it might be the smaller percentage and there is sometimes Earth-Based Mandates given circumstances of situations. <br><br><br>Here from what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this communication and what those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this communication in what they relayed for this communication. The two kinds of Parameterworks, one for each groupings of Spiritual in regards to Each Life. Two per life. The Clean and the Janky. It can be different parameterworks per life, certain life in which have chosen what their Main Spirit Guides relayed as well as other kinds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated have gone with similar parameterworks. So there is overlap of same parameters chosen in certain contexts. You might have an ethnicity that have more similar parameterworks. There is also a once a day reveal in regards to that first grouping of spiritual and second grouping of spiritual once a day in which can be a good alternatives for simplistic purposes especially regarding the clearing and substantiating. That&#39;s a realistic approach but it still matters in time of need if having to do with as to why some, if they, receiving turbulence from my process so said to be because of Alex James Hislop the physical. <br><br>Quality of life for this kind of both kind of spiritual matters in which I am not worried about because of what has been allotted in regards to activities for some of this spiritual and the kind it is within the dimensional thresholds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated especially when not revealed. They are not their to get attacked and you do not want to attack them as their might be legal and non-legal emphasis for some of therm. There is strong emphasis against trying to manipulate a response not intended. The idea was to safeguard people from receiving ill will, turbulence, conflict and immorality that was so said because of my physical life. It&#39;s not to emphasize arguing in a certain context it&#39;s to clarify in the moments that need be and to set interaction in a certain manner in which reflects. You don&#39;t how connected some of us are and Earth-Based in a certain manner is informed in regards to this life to the capacities that need be and some of that does include Joe Groups in which defenders I feel have been tip top. Regardless at times it&#39;s been said that certain kinds of turbulence has taken place in which why understanding the different kinds of buffers matter as well as overlaps, Non-Interactionals and interactionals because not all are their to take hits in ways in which some think. The idea still remains partially in tune with that in which we have seen with certain kinds of cinema type spiritual coming around when watching movies and setting the interaction to reflect more of the Artist&#39;s vision and what groupings of spiritual were going for in regards to the film itself. There is literal ones where the physical interaction is told to be a certain kind and other dimensional said to a certain kind in which augments the film and art in which there is authority and spiritual guideship mediation. Think of the same idea except for life. Those two groupings of spiritual help the interaction setting, ripple affect and impact from my physical life to reflect what the life wanted upon it&#39;s own life. IE: There is a physical on this physical planet earth, a certain kind traverses to process and turbulence ensues, they say it&#39;s because I wrote something in a book as to why that is taking place and those two groupings of spiritual upon the two parameterworks agreed upon between my Spirit Guideship, the Spiritual Guideship of that physical as well as the other kinds proceed under those parameters. Without these kinds of buffers life would look different and I do feel that in this context it can be beneficial in creating quality of life. That&#39;s what it&#39;s partially about. <br><br>There is other dimensional versions of these kinds of plans in regards to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides relayed matter greatly. There is spiritual that can apply this kind idea safely, you pick up an idea on these diary entries, go to the idea cleaners specifically for utilization of idea upon sensing ideas. <br><br>Ideas in which is good for simplistic purposes in enacting this?<br><br>Name for grouping of spiritual 1 - <br>Name for grouping of spiritual 2 -<br><br>I can&#39;t leave those areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this communication. I am scared at times because of some of the things that have happened. But there is dimensional existences, groupings of which can be put together in regards to a single dimensional setup that is within the context of where I would feel comfortable as well as where those that my Main Spirit Guides would feel comfortable in proceeding if there ever is a problem with me traversing and being that first grouping of spiritual alone. If there is others in that first grouping in regards to my physical life and the impact, ripple affect and other kinds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in which are considered different, it&#39;s only ever suppose to be the spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides relayed. If there is others in that second grouping in regards to my physical life and the impact, ripple affect and other kinds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in which are considered different, it&#39;s only ever suppose to be the spiritual that those that my Main Spirit Guides relayed indicated for this writing. <br><br>Business, Opportunity and Societal within the past four days since we had talked about intelligence and Story Maneuvered this way given some of the ripple effect and impact happenings. It was actually before thought where things seemed to truly change and it was the Pop Storyline days before and me writing while listening to music and love, belle and even earlier when talking about Gaming and mimicking actions and maneuvering actions from higher light in a video game style in being able to contribute from higher up above. When that had happened there was the scene in front of the mirror where I was looking in the mirror doing hand signals and story upon my process.<br><br>Pink, Magenta and other colours being more forceful in channel so said upon compassion.  Some said it was good idea, as there has been a negative perception in regards to Societal Types specifically within the past couple years at times in which had been seen through. Someone also looked at the seemingly lack of interaction between that kind in interaction which I remember the kind from year past in this process. Some want me to say Janky but as we have seen today Janky can be good and doesn&#39;t always mean bad because there has been good within those kinds of groups facilitating interaction and sometimes conflict. It should be remembered that some of it is real conflict. It&#39;s just we hadn&#39;t seen the Compassionate type do this on my end to the degree needed compared to that utilization in regards to other kinds of culture in which for some does include compassion. They said this interaction in regards to certain kind being more aggressive in regards to compassion and other kinds has been within the process as we continue to try and get to a comfortable perception and other kinds. It was an evening out considering some of the slander regarding societal at least through my end and the perception earlier n regards to some of the societal in depiction in which I never held at face value for some and that was understood. <br><br>#Remembrance #Process #Pink #Magenta #Compassion #Truth #Business #KnowledgeThatSpiritualAreStillAPartOfThisProcess <br><br></div>
