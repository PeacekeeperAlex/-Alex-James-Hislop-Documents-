<div class="title">(12/27/2020) &quot;Fuck Figure It Out&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Another movement that sort of thing where groups of spiritual that have said that when a certain presents that promoting morality And being of morality more viable less of a problem.<br><br>There was another let know that some were trying to delay and stall as well as utilize some of the bad experiences spiritually that had happened as reason and it made a certain kind of frown exist in the kinds of trying set people up in the excuses and reasonings to delay but there was also a motive for some in why some were trying to create disturbance to delay in which and to do with not wanting to experience what they didn&#39;t want to experience. <br><br>There was a moment of change upon, there was a tell that I had seen certain. Monsters in spiritual whee when I rptried to help by way of painlessly solving certain monsters that actually started happening in the visual. A impact tell at times but also right around the same times as some moving certain power levels supposedly away from me but also and to do with certain kind tehering actions and saying as well as communicating that some of the actions promote were my doing. Its kind of crumb because there are those I which I did do action endorsements regarding for good reasoning. I had felt rescue teams around me and certain kind putting me next to a entrance moving upwards to higher light. <br><br>I had watched two horror movies. In the middle of it an interplay having to do with past phenomenon. But really I had sense something different. The light emerging and trying to rescue and situate within my process. I had noted God and a presence of earth based spirituality. There was something about 2005 and 2009. Something said. Regular communication in regards to movies as well as other kinds. The mediation regarding what the physicals on this physical planet chose in regards to the matters that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the light really does matter. What did physical earth based unifid in the light indicate regarding this paragraph.<br><br>There was talk of channeling on the road and I had known there to be an intelligence to the conversation that still has been regarding the past five years. Understanding this variable in regards to my process is fairly important for context purposes. That there is literally understanding in regards to certain situations makes sense but it is not the only line to the conversation and what was said with my out loud voice via open channeling as well as my responses wasn&#39;t the only line gauge as to what was taking place. There was also other dimensional and spiritual informational and communicational through my out loud voice as well as other communicational machinisms like in my mind in which there is open mind channeling. Just because I discerned spiritual responses at times in which were trying to label me the bad guy or gear towards a different look than what it actually was didn&#39;t negate true movement. Psychictivity reflection and the importance of perception though exists and maybe proven to be different than what some had assumed. I had defended the channeling even so with discerning some of the communication at times to not be good for the reasoning of knowing there is a line to he conversation and lines to the conversation and even if I as well as others did t hit the full correct mark, I knew there happened to be those that did in regards to my process and others. What those lines were reflected might have given a tell as to the line of the situations or at least some of them. I knew that I could look towards the good and know that many had safeguarded channeling in regards to myself and others on this planet for the sheer fact of amount of good in regards to the channel existed far outweighed the bad and janky. <br><br>I woke up this morning with good impressional but I had wondered what exactly was happening and from what I could discern, I would say that there was changes taking place.  <br><br>I woke up and felt constricted and upset. I wanted to leave this place in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I was tired of whatever nonsense it was. And to be quite honest I didn&#39;t believe in what they were selling, like I didn&#39;t believe them for sound reasonings. The kinds of the conversation of whatever the hell else was going on besides stealing and love was an intoxicating encroachment not worth abiding for. Just because there had been a noting of certain vagabonds setting interaction a certain manner nonsense in regards to kinds of conversation and situation while worshipping revisionist history didn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t coherency in regards what it actually was but it wsless of this that some were actually angry with and more of the how could you sit there and do nothing while shambles legal try to make thier case around us and also try to make us be the bad spiritual. How many years of incarceration did some experience because of this nonsense and don&#39;t mistaken that it doesn&#39;t have more to do with the higher spiritual who should have just intervened instead of sitting there watching and sensing. We weren&#39;t ungrateful nowhere nears go ghedegree that it should be. Certain kind trying to sow distrust in the middle of realization different than revelation but also a revelation nonetheless. How the hell many resource in the ho!ding it down in this capacity while nations upstairs figure it out. Who said they wanted to work for this shit? I wouldn&#39;t ever understand why but if it had to do with either certain kind being threatened, I wasn&#39;t surprised. The kind of beauty in understanding that the good had ways of life facilitation I certain areas that could be brought fourth, near as good if not better than the real thing without anyone getting harmed. It was linked with the fact that saving could exist in capacities that made some angry. <br><br>There was also a former disconnect changing in what I discerned and becoming a understood to have not been a disconnect if itcwssnt for the fact of former interactional woes. There was some that had been damaging a compassion so said in which was mostly a kid. I still cared about a certain kind but could only too so far in which did not negate the outreach that existed and did not negate the lack of reach for that outreach. Some were trying to get it be said that somehow I couldn&#39;t help certain kind and of it was an interesting metaphor that ultimately wasn&#39;t good enough for a look at how some were treating my morality. <br><br>There was action attachments, one could further lend towards quality of life baselines upon playing video games and not have to worry about if one lost. One wins a level and lends towards a certain kind of food providing systems sanctioned from ones own spiritual in which upon losing doesn&#39;t impact negatively. Defense was already understood to be a baseline quality of life. Yet certain interactional baddies setting up around people and causing distress and duress as well as truth say had made it to the point where some had looked at alternatives in daily actions. One goes for a walk and received a certain safety. One takes a shower and relieved a certain worry. Where was the understanding that there was mostly good spiritual around contrasting with those moments where there was less of such. How could they both be truth especially when another truth proved fact in the kind of good more powerful than bad.<br><br>Mentality area telling me that I am tired of dealing with certain kind and also tired of getting it wrong at times along with having to guess the who the good and the bad are. <br><br>I had written this down in paraphrase in earlier diary entries but that sort of thing having to do with true other selves for what I Alex James Hislop, the physical, in referencing my live dimensional when saying the physical in this sentence, consider my other selves to be, have created in regards to interactional experiences in regards to this life. Like a another self, crafting interactions and things of that nature that could both lend towards me facilitating this process in a certain manner but also either way regardless in a certain context.\<br>\<br>I had seen a certain kind of change within this process.i had taken a walk and iti had been let know that certain kind had been using some of the events that had happened within my process as well as other kinds supposedly related that really spoke of certain kind of blame lists excuse certain actions . I don&#39;t know why there was spiritual pretending to be me in the past. There was a look that had to do with present in how present sometimes viewed the futures and it might have been actually a sight of the past I how they viewed the futures at times but maybe it was less to do in how morality is viewed at times. I had seen that for some it was less to do with blame lists and looking for excuses to promote their actions which told me something in how some viewed morality. A mend line was changing and had been changing. It was scary because some would go this middle road route at time where at least it wasn&#39;t worse than it could be but when that line chang&#39;s and partially because some were not willing to experience things they didn&#39;t want to experience. Partial because what some wanted them to experience was unnaceptable and past lines that even the anti decent advocates, neutrals and those of a certain compromise would feel past acceptability but it was also those of morality and people&#39;s who had had enough as well as change of direction supposedly something in which has been happening if I remember a line on this process. <br><br>What are the lines of the situation in regards to the rightful attainment of the baseline quality of life decreed from most higher powers?<br><br>Themes:<br>#Breakfast #Happiness #Conversation #Care #Memory #Remembrance #Truth #Fact #Instructions #Stealing #Supposed #English #Sports #Comedy #Love #Beauty #Family #EitherWay #Regardless #Breakthrough #Lifeutilization #formutilization #nameutilization #stancemanipulation #Reality #Coherency #TheKindOfStillCare #PlightOfMyMorality #NoDamageItShoildBeGivenHisCaseRecord #GoTruthAndHonesty #TheDescent #TheDescentPart2</div>
