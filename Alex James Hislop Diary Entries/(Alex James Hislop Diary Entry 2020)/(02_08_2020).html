<div class="title">(02/08/2020)</div>
<div class="content">Quote:<br>Through action, a Man becomes a Hero<br>Through death, a Hero becomes a Legend<br>Through time, a Legend becomes a Myth<br>And by learning from the Myth, a Man takes action<br>- Anon<br><br>Activity:<br><br>- There seemed to be lamenting upon certain kind of battle earlier on in them  with portions of the setting that had felt like open energies in which could have been influenced on my end but I feel a portion is the setting of physical earth. <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIssu3_IZQ0<br>- War and battle talked about and invoked in this process,  a portion of which are real wars and battles in regards to Earth-Based in which a certain amount have been utilized to Cover the ill utilization in regards to myself and my resources as well as the attack and harm in regards to myself and my own and ThePsychicWarGamers Utilization for specifics in regards to when I work on that endeavour these past couple weeks. Again trying to come up with reasons why that content can&#39;t just be what it should be. I choose what my Main Spriit Guides indicated regarding, myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides choose what my Main Spriit Guides indicated regarding. Those that my Main Spriit Guides indicated in regards to this writing, what exactly do you think about what my Main Spriit Guides relayed in regards to this portion of the writing? So there is warranting in regards to certain battle discernment and relaying pertaining to some of the battle and there is a portion that is decent for as decent as it can be. Peace has been utilized to a larger degree within this process to smoke and mirrors some of the points and happenings taking place but it&#39;s been utilized so much in this process that there are certain kind that can easily traverse and it&#39;s been called out more times in listed content in online areas from this process. <br><br>- Checking people out and there being a certain kind of spiritual circle to such an action from people at times. Imagine you check someone out and there is literally thousands and millions of spirit watching that interaction in which is actually might be a totally different action than what the physical action seems to be at times. <br>- The same as above but for some of the darker that certain kind do at times. For example there has been manipulation and influencing in regards to certain expression in which I have noted as a psychic in which has portrayed certain kind of expression as dark and scary. There being circles of spirit that watch this in a certain manner. <br>- Left eye medical observation after watching Cinema at the Theatre, in the same spot that I have experienced this, flash of physical light still dancing upon my left eye in what looks to be early cataract placement? The sun wasn&#39;t even full in my eye when I went outside on the side to puff on my esmoke, but rather when I went inside into the dark of theater that there was difficulty in seeing out of my left eye physically. I felt healing teams move in and heal my left eye but some also tried to displace something, I felt felt a certain kind of maneuver and a cracking kind of stimuli with spiritual rushing towards this displacement pertaining to my left eye. It felt like they had cut something off in regards to my other dimensional anatomy and I am wondering the quality of life is for my other dimensional selves that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and the allpersonal that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br>- Then while watching the movie there was a moment where my inner eyes were affected and I could feel and see light sparks and firings in my eyes in which looked similar to flashes of golden sparks. I felt the vision of other dimensional selves get forced to see what i seeing physically except that I feel that a portion are good and they tried to move this vision and steal this vision in a certain manner. I still don&#39;t feel that inner stimuli that I felt before going to the theater and I am wondering about what exactly happened and what the quality of life for my Allpersonal and other dimensional selves. Some are claiming that the spirit that did that too me are too important to litigate certain kind of justice but I also looked at something and I asked why is it that I couldn&#39;t receive defense that I needed in regards to these dimensional areas regardless of out in public watching a movie or within home sleeping. There had been a tactic pulled earlier with multiple discussions talking about good spirit in regards to myself but attacking  on the side in regards to others and vice versa. I think it should be emphasized the context in regards to those that are defending themselves and those that are just attacking in regards to these situations that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides relayed. It was also then utilized by a group saying that somehow there has been traversing and situating of those that are attacking some but being good to others but on my end it looked to be certain kind doing that in regards to certain spirit who were good to me and then the life utilization in regards to myself utilized that point to situate other things in which I was not trying to situate and not only that but then the following events in regards to the attack pertaining to my other dimensional stimuli and some claiming that the ones that did it protect a lot of different spirit which still makes no sense as to why I can&#39;t receive defense in the moment for myself.<br>- There was then stimuli discerned in regards to my other dimensional, I went to the washroom and there was this deployment of me feeling like somehow when I walk out of that bathroom that I am still in that bathroom. Also it felt like they places a certain kind of bladder and intestines other dimensional on my pant areas. That&#39;s the stimuli I discerned trying to turn me inside out and other kinds of maneuverings as well. <br>- What exactly did those that my Main Spriit Guides indicate and relay in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides communicated about in regards to this paragraph. <br>- The crazy of this is litigation in regards to if I was attacked spiritually as well in those areas that my Main Spirit Guides relayed. <br>- When we bring to other physicals on this physical planet earth in regards to their own spiritual and experiences, it becomes even more clear upon a large percentage of physicals not having done anything wrong in their physical live dimensional and how they don&#39;t deserve to receive turbulence or attack but rather deserve peace and prosperity. Even the criminal element in regards to physical earth-based upon some of the influence and manipulation as well as rippling to the spiritual as to why those influences exist don&#39;t deserve to get attacked. <br>- One of the discussions as well had been about the utilization of awareness and knowledge as well as incarnation to perpetuate acts to certain kind while also antagonizing those in safer areas regarding. The sort of thing as well in the mix in which might be one of the key points in which speaks of those with certain kinds of awareness levels having to defend to receive certain kinds of spiritual defense in which myself and others that my Main Spriit Guides indicated take the regardless philosophy that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in which espouses that regardless there should be spiritual defense and quality of life.<br><br><br>Themes: #Procreation #Consent #Simplistic #PortionsThatMyMainSpiritGuidesIndicated #Rescue #Non-Lethal #Non-Harmful #Humane #Digital #ThoseSimilarToMeToTheThingsIDo #Physical #Spiritual #Clarifications<br><br><br></div>
