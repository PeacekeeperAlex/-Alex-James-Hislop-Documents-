<div class="title">(04/26/2020) &quot;The Trains can run on Time&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Quote:<br>&quot;Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.&quot;<br>Suzy Kassem<br><br>&quot;The lot in life tired eventually for the truck will not go forever as has been proven.&quot;<br>- Anon<br><br>Activity:<br>One of the fore running themes for the past four days and potentially much longer than that given the tells of of Change and ebbflow nature of the Good speaks of presence that has been for a long while not only here but beyond both earth physical atmosphere and the dimensional boundaries of physical in which extends further to many different kinds of realms and ways of life. I have noted that a certain kind of je ne sais quoi in the pursuit of being able to find that phrase along with tells that exist through daily life of the strange and miraculous power of afterlife and what now wonder to do with what are we up too upon those passing on and incarnating. There has been this subtlety noted in that they are watching and interacting but intermingled with the sparkle of an eye in what some have said that there might be this maneuvering onwards approach in which truth dictates that many are watching and interacting with us by way of it&#39;s nature and being so. Especially upon the lines that have been both obscured and emphasized in this process and the others had made some feel as to what the reaction would be of the enlightened we know it to be regarding some of the not only darker revelations but also about the interaction itself and the presence of this kind of spiritual. It&#39;s a large spiritual to be true in which has been lent by way of discernment a power that exists with those true good, some of which at the end of the lines and this is not only within the energy discernment of this kind of category of spiritual and some would say it&#39;s a prominent category especially on physical earth-based spiritualist communities and spiritual earth-based spiritualism. Why wouldn&#39;t the want and desire to understand what some are experiencing currently and what some are doing upon those that have incarnated and passed on. It seems to be one of the variables strongly at times in regards to this spiritual category and the kind of happenings within my own process have lead many to ask what exactly thoughts given in certain situations of unfoldment. The tells and insinuations of course coupled with other kinds in certain time frames has leant towards not only a happening but reason as to why some are proceeding the way that they have. Imagine this, Imagine that there is a culture that exists not only in observation but also in interaction for some. That there is a variable upon those that have passed being a part of this and that some portray this to be more away from what is taking place spiritually around certain physicals on this planet in certain perceptions. Imagine they have power. Imagine they have choice. At what point does there seem to be a maneuvering of this to intervene and conflict upon that in which needs to be conflicted for the other onslaught that would take place even so might not be upon the power of true good, although this is potentially of true good as well and is apart of the true good protecting. In the past have recognized this presence to be preserving the sanity upon those that didn&#39;t get attacked by way of intervention and might have something to do with the heavens descending attitude for many has nothing to do with the bad doing good in which that perception has been seen to be present as well. A bad group does something bad and then goes good and does something good. Spiritually it exists in many capacities and when you look of the good that it does it provides reasoning for existence and you can identify that in which has been operating within away from that in which has been also doing the bad. What was plainly asked was when the heck are those that have passed on and potentially for the larger portion in regards to physical humans on this physical planet earth going to show up and make an appearance upon the obvious of existence as to how some operate. Should that be the good enough to fall upon the honourable sword especially given some of the finer details in which would rather look more like warfare upon an enemy in which you would not and if not war then something that might be worse. Civic duty never seemed so clear. It never seemed so simple if the simplicity exists. And it does. Truth never seemed sweeter than that in which says that we can set up a battle and clash without anyone getting harmed if not desirable but the real kicker is that they can setup battle upon consent that exist where there is damage and pain on either side existent without innocence getting attacked. Either way though the trains maintained and a buttload of more work to do for a point later down the road. The real truth is that movement regarding such a concept of spiritual has been on the move and there potentially has been intervention and conflict maintained to keep people and spiritual safe. Remember the point that most if not all of Physical Earth-Based is innocent, in the 90 percentile to be true and if the other number is true then at what point is creating freedom content worth what was has been given at times. Reason and Love, Intellect and Compassion. Sanity and Coherency. For that in which is getting harmed that does not want to get harmed. Can we not maintain the trains to run on time with truth of mind fulfilled? The answer is yes. The workload easier to be true.<br><br>Today Warfare and a certain kind in regards to my content at times for a portion but also something differently associated with my Diary Entries early 2018 having to do with content especially seemed to have been brought up and what an another group in 2019 upon some of the content creation I have done, specifically the AJH Diary Entry Content of 2019 energized and harmonized within a similar time frame upon 2019 seen within the AJH Daily Defensives Content. What it has turned into in 2020 still merits adulation for the kind of work and effort put fourth but there will always be an identifying factor at times throughout years upon the style and feel of a content in understanding the spiritual utilization of characteristics in association that I am able to note as a psychic medium. There has been a spirit in regards to myself having to do with battle, anger and identified at times to be a red colour but also a brown colour. There is relation to storylines having to do with the Sadness, Anger and Happiness trio prime that exists on this planet and others that my Main Spirit guides relayed and I feel that there has been a unfair treatment specifically in regards to these groups at times upon my interaction changing. Access in regards to my process I feel has continued to take place. Everyday though given my direction and choices, for example if I was to pursue canvas style paintings with certain artistic intent, what kind of spiritual would come around me in which would be different and both be different in a certain context in the difference upon pursuing such activities daily compared to solo attempts. For example the Wrestling weekends activity has garnered multiple kinds of different groups and interactions that would be different had I not pursued such activities. There is those within my process, myself included who do want good reserves for those that have been with this process in a certain manner in which I look towards that earlier spiritual around me and still around me and in pursuit of recording multiple kinds of content spiritually and otherwise regardless of whether it&#39;s in entanglement of certain life utilization regarding myself or not I feel them to be good and to be true they have side stepped gracefully some of the wacky that this process can be in regards to the life utilization variable. A stable component unto itself is how it is observed, seen and understood to be even in the thick of certain things. Regardless there is reservation for what some should have a place in this process but if some don&#39;t want to be a part of such there is left of a problem to be true and shouldn&#39;t be forced variable. There are those that deserve to have a spot in the process upon interaction and the list that my Main Spirit Guides relayed in regards to this writing suffices. I have not been trying to go against anger and warfare fronts in a certain manner especially with holding down the creed that war and battle as well as anger will always exist and should be maintained and that Anger should have it&#39;s rights to how we could have ever proceeded without remains a stark mystery vented daily. But I have been ignoring certain variables upon my stance in which has had to do with certain normalities that from what some consider to be a normal way of looking at things, physical human earth-based, seems to be the abnormal that at times has gotten me harmed upon some of the banner conflicts but also blamed unfairly in manners in which speaks that there are those that are attacking at times not in a warlike manner but still in warlike fashion at times. I had gone to the Honourable amongst some of us in a heated and passionate reference of how could we have ever gotten to this point in pointing towards as such in a moment where it hit the mark of understanding in which the context of which provided that mark. It wasn&#39;t just the fact of within my rights, it wasn&#39;t just the civilian attitude in which I pursue at times, it wasn&#39;t just the justification in proceeding the way I do but it was also the upon look at the others of innocence in which some have utilized as the reasonings as to why spiritual attacks continue to take place for me in which seemed to garner the response that it did. How then the utilization even upon the lax and liberal that I am in regards to the life utilization pertaining to the taking of things sad from myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides relayed to provide a context upon those that at times have proceeded in negative fashion and have harm in which remedy and reconcile in the civic attitude that exists not be utilized against me when time comes for revelation and truth. Is this seen to be them the good and me not so or is this more applicable than I previously estimated. It&#39;s a good alternative i Support should it not be utilized against me not only within present or past but future as well. I felt that presence of honourable upon the asking of an old question been asked many times that at what point did we lose ourselves in the pursuit of what was suppose to the remedy of ourselves but it was done in a context in which was subtle and plain to understand. One of the key things in regards to all of this really has to do with inflection rights in which is not just about physical out loud voice but really the larger of the Concept of Inflection. Also in the mix, is Argumentative rights and Venting Rights. Also Rights activism to be true upon the sight of attack and the communication to let know of what is sound and just. What is fair. Earlier I had let know of it all really to be stacked in a manner as to how some see it, the let me get this straight attitude of the incredulity that exists upon some of the unfairness that has emerged and been experienced for a portion and then the last parting point happened to be that we could have facilitated and can facilitate, at any given Time if some higher up above, and lower down below as well as in the middle wanted too, the ways of life near just as good if not better without anyone getting harmed given context of immorality. You throw up those points that way and there is no doubt about it as to the reason why the true good are intervening. Now if you throw it up as the truthful on either side it still cooks given context maybe in an even better fashion given plain and coherent advanced fashion. That&#39;s the kinds of power that exists. <br><br>Advice: Focus on what you want to have happen.<br>Peace: Modesty becomes a virtue.<br>Mind: Peace speaks true.<br>Silence: <br>Mythomy: Much of the to do has less to do with you given reservation.<br><br><br>Themes:<br>#Truth #War #Proof #Awareness #Vindication #Utilization #Manipulation #Influence #Fun #Games #WayOfLifeFacilitation #QualityOfLifeFound #Just </div>
