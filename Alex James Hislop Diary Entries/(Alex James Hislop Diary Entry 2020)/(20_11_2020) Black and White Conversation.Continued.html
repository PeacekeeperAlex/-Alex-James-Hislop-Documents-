<div class="title">(20/11/2020) Black and White Conversation...Continued</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>There was a moment of grace again emergence within this process having to do with a good kind in clarifications upon the cubby style cave of some of the strongest accords ever dang well seen but it was also something else that had Hearth of Home and peace of mind. I had looked at mine and certain kind had as well in which there was a certain kind of symbolism but not up to snuff side thoughts and realization that ones home can be ones room in how some view if need be. I remember a certain kind of material placed upon on my bed as some sort of ant-camp decent prank for what was hoped to be within the confines of my morality and it was disturbing even during these moments of recourse rectified. I just remember feeling good because I was able to be who I wanted to be even with certain spiritual trying to harass and harangue upon some of the smaller details of how I could operate. Like some sort of inflection of voice being the difference in what truth pointed towards already but the vindicating factor of need be might have the kind of mass upon smaller actions protected in the kinds of buffer working class heroes that exist. There was and might have been a conflict taking place where I had noted that when certain kind had left their homes, that certain kind of prowess existed for some of them. Like when they stepped foot on the grounds outside there hearth, they were a strength unrivaled. Maybe that strength for some was to remember. It was still a kind of blue meeting point of sadness even through rain soaked november of colour known and told to be something in which not true.  <br><br>There was then this let know of subtle authority that jives with modern in what I had discerned for some to get to a point for some of the modern look turned more intense banter that the understanding approach from some situated. Gentleness that seemed to speak to the modern of this earth-based culture. Maneuvering of Blue Alliance and Multi-Colour Alliance checking and situating. Spiritual of my morality maneuvering in the past 3 to 4 days had brought a wonderment as to what had happened regarding those battles of different kinds of morality that I remember speaking about within my analogue diary entry. There was also my kind of spirituality that reminded of the spiritualists on my planet earth for love and compassion as well as enlightenment culture spoken of. The jurisdiction was fairly understood by Physical Earth-Based in the Light. How were some to know that it would turn into a gong show on my end after such interaction situating and mending. <br><br>As I lay to go to sleep, certain kind attacked. I had wondered what my Morality spoke of in regards to this day especially early morning in what happened on my end. Certain kind manipulating anatomical in ways that scare me and the fact of psychic manipulation later even after the tremor twitch through my body during when the unravellment happened after the fact in the kind of not really bad guys reveal of certain things. A tell of a storyline that I had disliked and thought to be situated at least in regards to perception but also different ways of proceeding and time passed. There was a moment where I felt a certain kind of donzo with a third of the triangle of this storyline. It had to do with the bad that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. It was only supposed to do what my Main Spirit Guides as has been seen and told many o&#39; times. A scream in the mirror likewise was in defense of myself when I had had enough and there is a nuance that should be understood included. If I had been attacked by certain kind it was to lend defense for myself as well as others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding. I called what needed to be I felt and there was these impressions of having had enough. Tired of being attacked, angry with the Original Creator for not just intervening. For saving. For peace of mind. For being able to go back to the second in the fifth to be able to live our lives again. He was saying similar things except he was going about it through certain systems. I mean god dang it if it wasn&#39;t that like 50 or 60% of larger areas were in open discussion with the Original Creator in ways that reflected that he held similar similar opinions not only in regards to myself but a wide range of different peoples. What the hell was this about?  <br><br>The good still helped me, especially afterwards in showing up, it helped and I am thankful but they needed some to let know that ways of before of somehow bear and grin it were changing. There was these kind of communes and more decent kind around with creation energies as well as other kinds with interesting synergy with naturalism energies.  <br><br>Smaller matters supposedly being viewed as top secret, conspiracies and hush hush. Imagine World War II being viewed as some sort of smaller war matter and not being given the resources that it deserved. But it got resources, then again physical is an in front of the scenes kind at times for a certain kind of physical. <br><br>This was a productive day. A lot of different works happening but also maybe more prominatley from myself was the other kinds besides work and recreation. Still, I think there was something about both work and recreation. There was a synergy and a custom in this process sometimes having to do with one or the other but it was more than that and identifying and speaking on that earlier on in the day on my deck area mattered. <br><br>Heavenly filmaking more prominent in hollywood these days? I had a thought about Dimensional safety nets in the kind of prowess on film sets where if certain spiritual traverse there a certain catch happens with artistry facilitation in regards to the directors vision corresponding to the film takes place in senseworks form upon sensing a certain kind of film safety net upon the movie. I had noted a a marker in my memory when talking about films and the fact that in the light there is spiritual and other dimensional filmaking but there was also a key tell that heaven and hell as of late has been involved in which isn&#39;t new but maybe something situated upon veil thinnest on such a year as this upon Sam Haine. I didn&#39;t know what the tell was but I thought it had meant that there was more of a pominancy these days but maybe it was perception and awareness that was causing this to be the feeling. <br><br>Themes:<br>#Legal #Served #HigherLightSafePassageOhShit #PastProcess #MiddleOfTheNightGambit #Squirmy #Procreation #Anatomical #CertianKindLookingToBlame #CoveringActions #AngryWithTheOriginalCreator #LashingOut #LogicalConclusions #MakingRuns #JourneyingWithTaxi #Air #Channelling #Physical #ThoseNamesThatMyMainSpiritGuidesIndicated #ThoseNamesThatThoseSpiritGuidesThatMyMainSpiritGuidesIndicatedRelayed #Schedule #OfficeRoomLife #Activity #DoSomething #Situated #Situating #WishAdventruesOfShopping #Sadness #MoodSad #MoodMotivated #MoodEnergyHappiness #Dissillusioned #ElemntalUponElemntalWalk #ThankyouMentality #Thanks  </div>
