<div class="title">(02/12/2020)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I started crying when I woke up and multiple kinds of spirit creating that cry and not labeling that cry for a certain amount. There still being an off kilter direction in off hand insinuation pertaining to certain kind being attacked and also trying to manifest such things to take place. This culture seems to be higher and when they brought down yesterday a certain machinisms of anatomy and form in which was in the likeness of an actor in which I have utilized their form in regards to Arcon in which is a moniker and life of mine and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, I noted that this higher culture was different supposedly more my speed and the game continues with the movement of myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in certain culture for a portion in which has been continually moving and the feelings of some are that they don&#39;t want me to continue stay in certain areas while others view it more like like a movement for myself and still there are those that would want me to stay. This isn&#39;t just in regards to myself but others as well. I have a feeling that some some still at lower levels have been asking and wondering when they are going to be moving upwards at least for some of them. There are also those that don&#39;t want to be moving upwards. One of the big tells is that the places that I was when I went to sleep is that they for some of them had been facilitating crying and good things while on the side there had been a culture in regards to certain kind of spirit in which had been taking advantage and trying to play it a certain way. While the higher up above culture noted had been angry in comparison. <br><br>The Devil had been discerned on my end in multiple at times. He is a real spirit and God, an Angel in which I have had a good relationship with on the surface. There are potentially many in regards to The Devil and big one resides in New Orleans. There was an interplay with the Devil on my end and the Devil in New Orleans. I think it was more a trade to be true but maybe in there culture a bit of fight is natural. There is this culture in New Orleans that I have discerned in which reminds of Lower Plane and Lower Area Culture. I think that&#39;s one of it&#39;s beauties and it ends towards multiple aspects of the peoples, culture and even traits and qualities in regards to such. I and others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for the New Orleans Disclaimers that my Main Spirit Guides indicated to be displayed overlapping New Orleans the way my Main Spriit Guides indicated. I feel there are ways to still interact with those in the lower areas. I feel the information regarding that my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding should be displayed daily where my Main Spriit Guides indicated. <br><br>The changes on Earth are being noted and understood. On the ninth something happened, something seems to be happening and upon some of the gatherings things are taking place but also in regards to other kinds as well, even those that are at home and don&#39;t go out often. Vibrational changes taking place and movement of dimensional. Upwards and onwards as well as other kinds. The Event, New Earth, Ascension Process, The Shift, The Rise. It&#39;s taking place and been taking place but on my end it&#39;s been.<br><br>It got to a point where they put me on some sort of super speed system maybe time related but I even said that in the Original Setting they have the time and always did, seconds go by in this physical and trillions upon trillions of years if not more so go by in the Original Setting and Original Light and it&#39;s a logical extrapolation upon the creation dimensional existences and non-dimensional existences that time would be that way upon creation from the Original Setting and Original Light. Either way it&#39;s still suppose to be set the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated and in regards to other dimensional setting specifically with what is taking place at times should beset the way my Main Spriit Guides indicated in regards to myself and others that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. I don&#39;t think this is about attack. I think this might be about cleaning but I am not certain, maybe it&#39;s defense. Certain kind of acceleration happening when I feel it has already been accelerated to a certain degree in a certain manner. Light? What the hell is going on. <br><br>Dream: <br>I woke up and there was this dream. I saw a family member getting attacked and she saved herself in the dream but I also was watching and could see her be saved. I saved her as well and it seemed to be a dream in which was about saving her. Maybe the biggest tell for some of it was that she didn&#39;t need saving during certain moments. She always had energies around her in which spoke of that. I remember next being in some rich mansion, with light hallways that were so regal that they seemed to be different than any other mansion on this planet. I remember going with that family member and other people as well throughout the mansion with zombies outside and zombie apocalypse taking place. This is the seventh or either dream I have had. <br><br>I have noted happening up above in what I am able to discern as a psychic medium some of which having to do with legal. There has been multiple movements of banners and banner culture and one of the insinuation had been that some were angry with me and others that my Main Spirit Guides but rather I feel it might be a disagreement in how to proceed with facilitating physical culture. There seemed to have been an emphasis in that sort of thing where good banners at least in regards to their own people but also similarities in a certain sense to physical earth-based nations in that there is a certain degree of morality. Infiltration of culture has been a topic of discussion and I have noted certain aspects of physical-based to be battling at times in regards to some of the changes that have have been happening as of late and to be true for awhile now. There is this thing about the taking of rights of certain people and the rationing back of those rights when certain attacks as if it is compensation to be had. There is also another culture in which facilitates certain battle and war at times in a certain manner that can facilitate peace systems in which some have pointed the disparities regarding in a certain light. So think of this, a war break out and instead of just having that war, there is a battle once a month and during that one day forces maneuver in a certain fashion pertaining to certain accords and then on the other days there is a peace. The problem is that within the confines of certain rights issues there has been battles at times in regards to Earth-Based rights in which have been going on for quite a while now and then regardless there have still been rights issues whether there has been battle or not. This continue on of certain kinds of ways within the winds of change if looked at from a certain angle seems to be extending disparities but also extending a certain kind of peace. Those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated facilitating these wordings for good, go to the (AJHD) Daily Questions to the Spirit (Untitled Conversations with Spirit).txt document. <br><br><br>Ideas:<br>New Orleans defensive disclaimers in changing vibrational climate.<br>Those that have brought fourth ideas in regards to this process and myself.<br><br>Themes: </div>
