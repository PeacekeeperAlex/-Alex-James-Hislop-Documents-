<div class="title">(01/18/2020) &quot;Psychological Warfare&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Quote:<br><br>Activity:<br><br>Medical Observation:<br><br>- (There was a dream about prison guards and a certain kind of holding area in a basement. Afterwards I woke up and they kept talking about a certain kind of realism that reminds of broken glasses and snapping, the kind of one sock on and one sock off and how they are healing and have been good at times in the past in that some of the events that have happened spiritually have made some go a certain path in which a portion regret in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. They kept talking and asking like what exactly it is that was rippled in regards to vent in regards to what happened to me spiritually, like what is my snap in regards to my soul and where has it manifested. My answer is that it should be done the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated and there is a portion of my feelings and other kinds that my Main Spriit Guides indicated that has been moved upwards to the areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. If it was up to me I would have a spirit from the Original Light whisk away what my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding to where my Main Spriit Guides indicated pertaining to myself the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There was spiritual attack in regards to certain kind pertaining to smell and lung areas in regards to myself with a certain group that feels a certain way in regards to me living.)<br><br>(My process changed today in which it finally felt like I wasn&#39;t being attacked and under fire contrasting the previous eleven days. I felt the process move to open areas higher up and open mindedness like stimuli set in. Real head machinisms in regards to open mindedness exist and and it can feel like head area blooming and opening in which can discern clean energies. This though felt like process energies changing. It felt similar to that of Saskatchewan in that some continue to claim that as a reasonings as to why it should be more bubble like process closed and put off to the side partially because I lived in sask and some were saying that certain deployments and process facilitation in regards to that areas upon some thinking we were going to be staying. How does this correlate with my sister being born and us eventually traveling to Ontario to live here due to the better handicap resources. I feel that my sister is a powerful psychic at times and that there should be safeguards pertaining more so than at times has been evident. Anyhow I felt multiple kinds of stimuli in regards to this process finally reaching areas where it feels to be more open and room to breathe as well as presence of spiritual that is and was different than the past and not to say that there wasn&#39;t spirit in g the past that were good but that the shake ups this days and things changing specifically upon the kind of damage of the past 10 days has finally been situated at least on my end. I know there is probably others on earth both physical and spiritual where there is still difficulties and turbulence in which needs attention. )<br><br>(I felt systems deploy around me said to be good but the kind in which is sometimes shadowy, realism let knows in regards to something going on. Later on discussions about multiple kinds of things I did key while utilize certain voice systems and things of that nature. Things were going to well until there a deployment of certain of other dimensional stimuli and it happened when I was outside the house and when I went back I could feel a cloud of other dimensional stimuli. It felt like psychological. There was other dimensionals having difficulty breathing and I felt a change of overlaps in regards to my other dimensional. There was multiple deployments on my house, not just this smoke and mirrors in front of the scenes deployment on my end, on my end there was multiple kind of deployment overlapping my body, thoughts and other kinds of machinisms changing and dissipating. Certain spirit trying to create more powerful weapons potentially off of the one that got deployed off of the multiple kinds, the idea to deploy multiple kinds of weapons in one area, relaying spiritual stimuli and then crafting that to the other more prominent weapon that was talked about and utilized sometimes some mistaking other kinds for that initial weapon.  )<br><br>- (It was said to be a good day for me in regards to story and other kinds. Multiple decent happenings in which felt like it was turning out in mine and others favor. On my end spiritually I feel it was truth but physically being stuck down here and some of the other dimensional selves in regards to mine did not benefit at times. I was attacked in a manner in which I did not expect and not had fully experienced in that way. It was sad to see the state of the situations upon waking up which makes me wonder what could have happened during the sleep to have cause such malice and despair upon waking up. )<br>- Channel affected today in adverse ways. Movement of certain kind of nail in which felt electric in my head area. It was invoking erratic behavioiri n regards to channel and perspective as well as other kinds in which might have been a ruse for something else taking place. Movement of anatomy. I would go into town to try and get some air. It felt to be more of the same times on the road and would more attack would commence at times. Certain people were appalled and some of the spirit in such anguish because of what is taking place. Spiritual in such turmoil and conflict that it is paramount to receive the resources from higher light and higher dimensional areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I do not know when it will finally be figured out and considering there is more time passing in many light existences and dimensional areas compared to the time that physicals are experiencing on Earth-Based in a certain manner to be able to figure out such affairs I don&#39;t see why it has to be this way and nor do I feel it will be a good enough reasoning for the harm, hurt and suffering that has taken place and is taking place. With the ability to be able to intervene it makes it upsetting almost to the point of madness and anguish. Even if a fraction that has been insinuated to be true would be War for many people and spirit with the grounds to do so based upon the caseworker and evidence in regards to those experiences of what has truly happened. Along with the other-dimensional stimuli experienced and spiritual communication makes me to be scared and frightened about the kinds of things that have happened.<br><br>- The preparation for today that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br><br>#SmokeandMirrors #PointBeingLost #Saving #Realism #Story #DimensionalMovment #TwilightZone #PerceptionCrafting #Rippleaffect #Migration #Emmigration #Justice #Legal #Interaction #InformationalPlacement #System #War #Peace #Truth #Lies #Utilization <br><br><br></div>
