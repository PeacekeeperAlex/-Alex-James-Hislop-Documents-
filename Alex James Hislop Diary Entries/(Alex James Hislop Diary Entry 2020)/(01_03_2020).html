<div class="title">(01/03/2020)</div>
<div class="content">Quote: <br>All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost; the old that is strong does not wither, deep roots are not reached by the frost. <br>- J. R. R. Tolkien<br><br>Thought: <br>Ignore the blind to see.<br><br>Activity:<br>There are spiritual Banners and Nations that exist behind the scenes. It&#39;s not just in regards to the physical Nations of Earth but it is also in regards to many other kinds of Concept located on Earth. I am not certain when I realized that some of the Banners Spiritually were not all decent. The tell was already there when I would experience some of the outlandish months after my psychic breakthrough. *Interject that there are good banners* The way I viewed certain things already let know that I believed in the negative although not necessarily in the ways that some were portraying during those time frames. The way the Spiritualists view it on this planet is good and truthful in that there is cultures we go to afterlife that are good. How exactly was I suppose to explain what I had learned the past couple years especially in a way in which regular people would understand. We need to be able to speak about the things we go through spiritually but at what point do you not want to speaks about it anymore. At what point do you not ask as to why that enlightened cultures to where we go after we die not intervene in regards to some of the other kinds of culture I would notice to exist. Some point towards informational creation as the bad guy at times. Relaying of events within my process while keeping a Journal. Big Lines spoken about. Understanding some of the difficulties and issues that exist on Earth-Based and other places as well. Argumentatives, Conversation and Debate. It ended up being realized that those weren&#39;t decent enough reasonings especially given context as to why some of the negative and bad spiritual was taking place. And if it didn&#39;t work in my process it sure as heck wasn&#39;t going to work elsewhere or at least that&#39;s what common sense said. I even though of it from the perspective of some bad spirit and the response if what was to happen to me  was to happen to them would be Warfare. There wouldn&#39;t be a blink of the eye if what I pulled the kind of stuff that certain spirit did at times here in the physical in regards to the spiritual. Dimensional disparities and in front of the Scenes difficulties I suppose. The crazy thing was those upset about those breaking apart in a certain context and I saw what they were saying but how they labelled in this process and have continued to label it at times probably made it even more difficult to operate for that smooth feng shui bad spirit pretending to be good. There is a translation that exists in which is lost at times when it goes past those lines and thresholds. In the Higher Dimensions it might be one thing but below certain lines it just turns into something else. There as been a note of trying to create something to happen upon my writing at times in which is under scrutiny. A trap basically in which some spirit would point towards other kinds as well as being a trap in regards to certain spiritual actions and proceedings so said partially because of the amount of turbulence that has happened within this process. Is the question as to what exactly happened behind the scenes to much to ask? Is learning about the spiritual warranting a wrath that might stem from the previous question. When you get attacked isn&#39;t it normal to defend oneself? If the answer to one of the ultimate questions for truth happens to be that there was morality in the beginning and that there is a large amount of it today, then that in which is pointed towards having to do with the spiritual turbulence existing behind the scenes and changing as is continued to pointed out for some of the reasons some of the defenders have been attacked. you have to remember that there has been a fluid conversation on my end about some of the things that have existed and exist behind the scenes. Some of which is a depiction but some of it is real. Conversations and experiences, communication and proof about some of these difficulties. Spiritual attacks and battle taking place in all kinds of manners. Let know of a a culture that thrives off of immorality where to be criminal is a way of life and not a crime. Imagine the aspects of our society colored with dark and red and the black-hearted and immoral. Where it&#39;s an everyday thing to jump some dude on the street and where it&#39;s adapted within the legal systems. It&#39;s understood that this exists within certain thresholds at times in which has been overlapping some of us. Imagine 100 dimensional existences, 65 of which are the moral and enlightened that the spiritualist communities speaks of, the good. Imagine another 20 in which is more dark, a tougher version of our own society for a portion, some of which are more grimey and dark. Where there is things that take place in which both remind of our own culture, some of which in an immoral way and other in a more strict way. Imagine another 15 in which is the hellish description that some of the good books have let know. Where certain kinds of monsters and Demons reside. This example of a hundred dimensional existence exists is metaphorical and the real amount is probably much larger and the percentages different. Still it lets know of what I am trying to say. Our interaction in what we are experiencing behind the scenes, if we were experiencing certain kind of harm in regards to our god spark by way of other dimensional selves. Is that the kind of issue that we would want to ignore? Is that the kind of thing that we would want to not address? I feel there are safeguards in play to protect us in multiple kinds of ways and that certain programs shouldn&#39;t be affected but if there is a portion of either section of what I have listed in interaction with ourselves while we are incarnate and otherwise, at what point did it just become a non-issue in higher light? Where some just accepted such lot in life to the degree to literally walk away from the kinds of terror and suffering that perspectives of self are experiencing. We hear a lot of discussion about higher selves and the guidance pertaining and even with all of the spoken word and communication we have white wash utilization of our culture to discard that guidance and to ignore it and some in higher light having Gaul audacity to be blaming us down here who don&#39;t even have the awareness levels needed to fully understand it in the live, some of the legal systems agree. Would our legal system agree? I would love to hear from the perspective of our own legal systems that are located in higher light. The idea that there are those in the Original Light that can speak towards us in many different manners as if they were in the live. Imagine a running conversation and experience with our live perspective in higher light in which has a dialogue and understanding for a portion that is expanded by way of learning and teaching. Three Key questions; If so much change has happened in moral way then why doesn&#39;t it fully reflect that at times on the outside world? If there is a larger culture of Morality then why is it at times not recognized or acknowledged pertaining to the amount of defense spiritually already in play? If there is such spiritual defense as I and others know there to be then why is it blamed at times the kind of defense work being done in certain areas? Which shouldn&#39;t be the difference between quality of life or not anyhow regardless. <br><br>- (A certain kind of thieving was said to have happened to a certain extent last night although I kind of feel it was spiritual attack. They moved me away off of certain infrastructure in which I felt channel shaking and certain kinds of spiritual death.)<br>- (Another moment when I couldn&#39;t get to sleep from that kind where your barely asleep and there is something spiritually keeping you awake, where I would feel a certain deployment of bad on myself and other kinds. Certain spirits fighting over areas is some of it but somehow I don&#39;t feel it has all do to with it. They tried to insinuate that it was certain kinds of bad spirit getting attacked but I could see through a portion.
