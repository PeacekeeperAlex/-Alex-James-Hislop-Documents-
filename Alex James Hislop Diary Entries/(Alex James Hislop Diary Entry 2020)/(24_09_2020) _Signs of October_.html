<div class="title">(24/09/2020) &quot;Signs of October&quot;</div>
<div class="content"><br>The night sky was alight with embers far greater thought than the sparks of the flame that was lit in the backyard of the Samaritan. It portrayed the betrayal of such a thought for the kind of starlight within the average fire was seen from the other side of what some thought life pertained towards. It was the wonder that was not understood in ways that it needed to be and yet it spoke of a beauty that not everyone to experience. To have such power within life and yet not known or understood enough to utilize and rather living emphasized beyond what one could be within life. Maybe it was the tell of darker things in the ash grey and black soot of what it was supposed to be supposedly for why some emphasized living their lives. It almost cried in the face of such potential willfully on purpose for such Natural truth of the matter dictated that it had less to do with sadness and willing away from such prospects even though Story told the might be honest and symbolism of such native disposition and that it might be the meaning for such proposition if evident enough to relay. That a person would walk away from such Starlight. A regularity occurrence that provided scoff and put off in incredulous manners so said obvious. The lost of such opinion like dragging feet of War prisoners in Winter snow that refuse to light the fire of such realization. It was that kind of cold that maneuvered the masses to ignore the happenings of other places beyond and beside with focus on zombie shuffle in the night. <br>It wasn&#39;t that the Samaritan did not care or couldn&#39;t care but rather that he did not know. There was a spiritual suspicion that if he had known, that he might turn away but not that he surely would turn away. It was this settle in the air that was around the Samaritan this night. He breathed it in, almost as if in conversation with ghosts of the past and harbingers of the Future with less to do with his present. He was the hope of an afterthought. His eyes reflected in the flames of the burning embers of October. They told him to live his life. They told him to stay away. And at what point did he realize that those words as hollow as they were given understanding were not his saving grace. The out as sweet as it was seemed to torment in the kind of way given no choice upon such choosings. He might have misunderstood the fire and it might have been more than the metaphorical he didn&#39;t realize and maybe wouldn&#39;t have chosen to realize. What exactly did he know was asked from the flames like some General that didn&#39;t have time for these games. Impatience wasn&#39;t discerned from the Samaritan himself, he was calm like the night itself almost in reverence of Peace. That in which maintained as such hidden in the bonfire and the lover of that in which maintained. The wind seemed to answer the question in subtle and gentle fashion spoken of air, clear in sight and see through that told he knew as most did and oblivious emphasized at the same time. The brilliance reflected within the fire itself seemed to communicate how that in which was hidden in the flames felt. An unspoken meaning understood how the normal person both knew and didn&#39;t know. It was the tragic and the triumphant. Ideas born long before War had emerged where Peace was only known. There was a sparkle of remembrance not for that in which existed before warfare but rather a use that emerged later on in time.<br><br>Religion grouping around early morning. Gods kingdom mentioned. I had wondered if religion on this planet physically spiritually grouped together in regards to this process to tackle problems specifically in regards to religion but also other kinds of activity as well as. I felt them work together on certain specifics good to see.<br><br>When I woke up again I had gotten upset, I had felt threatened even though I didn&#39;t know why. and I had seen a certain kind of spiritual interaction I had remembered earlier where I could see and sense the spiritual interactions in a fantasy and spiritual kind of way. One in which still fits the process to a certain degree one of the dimensional interactions I have noted that I feel some were trying to say was the reasoning that I got upset. This was a part of energy manipulation and emotional manipulation I was able to feel, some of which having to do with peripheral anger impressing upon me and god if I was experiencing that peripheral or if that peripheral was another self then at what point do I ask what that was all about? One to ask I suppose. There was something about chosen ones and how certain kind compared to me were making me look a bit like chicken scratch but it was also one of those things that I already pointed out in certain manners not as to denote my own chosen one status. Many of us are Chosen Ones, but sometimes for fear of safety, defense, quality of life and power to achieve all three previous as well as other kinds if need be sometimes dictates a certain kind of conservative approach in understanding there are other kinds powerful out there. Maybe it was my knowledge that Good had more power than the bad that safeguarded my liberal viewpoint and ways of operating and maybe there is a tell in the mix that has less to do with the bad.<br><br>I went for a walk and got back to the house to feel that kind of psychological kind of affecting air suction and thinning in which I can feel affecting me physically, more in front of the scenes kind of dimensional attack but also a shaping variable regarding. I feel it might have less to do with some of the happenings taking place especially if conflictual partially by way of what others have tried to attach to certain kinds of signs of warfare and things of that nature. That was a part of the crafting and shaping variable seen but also that some of them are of certain groups that have lent hands and opportunities to those with backs more up against the wall. Again the kind of thing where you see a physical working on something which portrays more of something else, like reading a newspaper portraying someone building armaments in impressional. I can note it as a psychic and while its a real solution there is also mislabellment and misleading for some physicals that are not choosing those roads but it also must be understood that some of them are choosing those roads at times. Breaking Bad style. In the real that exists out there especially sometimes more high up because forgotten in the mix at times is that there are physicals located in higher dimensional setup in which is correlating with less psychic by way of how some can set such things. Most physicals on this physical planet earth are not psychic in a certain sense classically labelled as a physical psychic but that doesn&#39;t fully denote that they are always in certain dimensional reminded of non-psychic both by way of what they are not feeling but also because of the different kinds that exist out there known to have certain kinds of spiritual around themselves and other dimensional around themselves. The crafting component again seen in certain manners where spiritual trying to shape armaments and things of that nature. This might have been the bad realism and the bad creation type working together in certain senses but on this day I discerned the shaping aspect to be good or at least the tell was there but I am not certain about peripheral and what else went on. That&#39;s the thing of it isn&#39;t, the kinds of things i wasn&#39;t able to fully sense or know and to surmise such on a topic that some spiritual can already identify as more dangerous especially when utilization of belief and feeling utilization as the excuse in shaping but when it&#39;s good? Right. That&#39;s the difference I guess, a good shaping lending towards arms crafting where healing prominent behind the scenes spiritually. Rather than something worse but the balancing act remains at times. I dont know the circumstances for the attack if there was one. Again the tell was that certain kind under the gun. The reasons are explained and not only spiritually at times. Asking these kinds of questions save because the ripple affect of asking those questions ensues an understanding as to why some operate the way they do. Like I couldn&#39;t have a couple days just talking about societal and spiritual without some sort of problem taking place and somehow I feel the reasoning to colour my diary entries and ultimately one of my books seemed to be partial peripheral evident. The battle for the homes seen evidently to matter specifically through groups of physicals trapped behind lines for too long and mislabeling as such upon innocent with contrasts of impressional that reminds of construction. At what point did construction workers look around because of the mislabeling of them and mishandling of some of the construction in other dimensional before they decided to fight back and when did the fight back itself get mishandled as well. There is a tell in the mix though for when some point to realistic in front for the scenes in a certain capacity, there is spiritual with the power to be able to affect as such and the answer why is simple and obvious for the kind of normality in defense exists transcendence but somehow at times that lack thereof not only in reasoning as to why we need spiritual as such but also in response and lack of response seems to dent that transcendence to point near those that have passed on that review as such let know of something wrong. Is it the tell half ignored? Where are the Authorities regarding some of these actions? Where are the silent Non-Authorities protecting us from this for if the Authorities failed? Earth-Based Authorities on this one, let know from the spirit, as I am a psychic-medium, that this wasn&#39;t a response from Earth-Based Authorities that my Main Spirit Guides indicated for the portions they relayed. Maybe it was the back against the wall tell and maybe the tells from those Earth-Based Authorities that my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding requests that really matter solidified in  evident manner tell the story needed to be told. Maybe someone will finally work past the threats and strongarming as well as the good living happening to do something about it. <br><br>The things we do in life matter at times, it doesn&#39;t always have to matter. The kinds of spiritual ripple affect and action attachment regarding the kind of things spiritual can create through physical interaction is miraculous. Laptop Computer light at night creating an atmospheric of healing, literally lending fourth to healing energies and personal energy creation around oneself. Whether this is the physical or spiritual is still debated today.<br><br>#Respect #Story #Magic #Creation #Realism </div>
