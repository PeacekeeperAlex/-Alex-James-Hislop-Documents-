<div class="content">Sunshine jail pants walk with a work shirt. Bought some smokes and really clean air and high energy western feeling. <br><br>Gilgemesh small talk turn big get the shit out of my face bad vs good forming up, prompted important to a certain degree to try and help, after waking up the taking seriously of certain situations by way of pop culture reference interplay, negotiation style. It was one of those where interaction and reaction debates of blame take place to be found not the true problem upon bringing up events listing, now in regards to bringing certain spiritual and people in the fold, I might have more to do with that by way of how I operate at times, or maybe it was the kind of attacks taking place around me with good controlling the variable of hopes fulfilled upon knowledge. It was interesting that that knowing would also be the reason of cock eyed browed suspicion. <br><br>Before hand I got into a row and boiling point in regards to that non interventionist portion of Archaic and Arion. The Original Creator. I didn&#39;t know why there was some pretending to be him and/or her but I felt there to be a variable in my process dealing with some of those lines. The kind of interplay taking place in explaining the kinds of situations sometimes in crossing lines of different culture, society, politics and ways of life in handling and being able to handle as well as having what needed to be able to deal should be understood, especially in a process like this. There had been a bring up of non-interventionist earlier on in this process, a couple days ago though in this instance on my end and it felt to be surfacing boiling point regarding fairly quick this time, sometimes I would see conversation and themes brought months previous to something talked about throughout and there had been a certain kind of interaction story nontheless earlier on in what seemed to be maneuvering certain kind of dark story away, insinuated to be dark. It kind of felt like police were handling the situation throughout and some of them did want me to get to sleep but some not so and when you look at either side of the line as to bad regarding, it certainly left some wanting. The continued insinuation that certain kind I care about under duress, who are innocent both in life and in regards to the situation a regarding my process has been continuing and taxing. In fact that was partial insinuation as to why I felt the way I did. Continued psychic attack is another reason as well as events especially warfare related, in which warfare has less to do with and so does war for that matter in trying to organize some of the conflicts instead of outright anarchy. <br><br>I had gotten to a point earlier where I felt a viewpoint as to why some had gotten to a point in attackin the original Creator especially given the fact that the higher up regarding in the natural original setting state had enough power with combining to do so, but it didn&#39;t mean there weren&#39;t those holding it down in certain areas regarding him that didn&#39;t have that power level without a certain way of proceeding and there was still the point of the smoke and mirrors that itt was like in fighting the Original Creator, in which did not extend to those that were harming and being immoral in certain manners while pretending to be the Original Creator. Action attachment aside was the sentiment this night in a certain manner at least for those who were doing bad for true. The biggest reason for not the Original Creator might have been the Golden Rule on this planet for when you thought of it in regards to yourselves it became more difficult to attack but it was rather something for some, it had to do with fathership and fatherhood as well as the others that need be said. Antics to shake the tree wasn&#39;t just frowned upon at times from where I was from and some of it was just frowned upon but also more so as it was also a love and care for family. Dang, it was the same reason why I was angry with him but also knew on multiple fronts that attacking wasn&#39;t the answer and yet I still noted spiritual manipulation sending me in that direction, I also knew the light for what the spiritualists indicated in the kindness and compassion, peace and hope as well as enlightenment that truly existed along with the other words of love and who we truly our for why it would be one of the most difficult tasks to even contemplate such extreme of shaking as to attack, some said energy placement up top was what was needed but some from down below gave a look that almost usurped the middle. For you see the middle was angry and maybe it had less to do with not being to be who one wanted to be for if only that were true. I knew the Tru Tru on that ish and it was not as far far as what some had in mind, it could be right next to them, it could more better than what they ever said and maybe itt was those that knew, shaking with something different than anger of something they had in mind. That didn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t moving on, that didn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t care and it didn&#39;t mean I was the only one as there were way betters in the mix as well as my handlers. I had a Debate with Jesus about the Original Creator as well as even within the week of being on edge that would freak a prophet out or at least some of the kind of prophets I knew existed on this planet in which didn&#39;t there wasn&#39;t prophets that understood and it didn&#39;t meant that the prophets of this planet understood for the kinds of struggle at times bear witness for what had took place spiritually behind the scenes to such gravity. Maybe the reminders of good middle wasnt just told by prophets but also the average supposed. <br><br>I realized that personally that took over understood what I was going for and who i was, I knew it wasn&#39;t just about me but also others of similar creed and that that recognization of morality on this planet for what was seen and understood to be true in what the kind cleans up of version which included 420 inclinations was watching upon us and for some of them understanding some of the horror to smile face through in being the kind of good spiritual that one can trust. It seemed to be the sticking point and a stick up point for some. We needed spiritual we can trust and me kind of felt like I was less trustworthy by way of the ledge that would be so easy yet so scary to take upon such a life as this and the kind of good that had had enough. The kind of news getting out regarding that some of the regulars on this planet had aspects of I thought for a portion had happened in regards to this process.<br><br>It&#39;s been, the kind of harass and harangue has been identified to not necessarily be the problem. <br><br>God interplay as well as a classic realism green interaction in what seemed to extend from earlier on interactions and I rem ember seeing lift off to some sort of gathering in the sky and traverse. arlier there had been impressional of gold in a different way than I had seenbefore<br><br>I had only been talking to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to me to talk to. I can towards buffer works in the light solely if a problem and what is the remedy for the buffer works under duress?  \<br>\<br>this audio, quick m6ov5em6ent this day on m6y end , I hav5e let known that I do beliv5e ingods that are physical, and I hav5e noted thesenergies sim6ila to super m6an in a certain sense.
