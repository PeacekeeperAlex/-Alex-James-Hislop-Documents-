<div class="title">(12/06/2020) &quot;Non-Stance&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Silent morning with tones of reflection but in eerie fashion that reminded of not wanting to speak or interact in which has classically been seen to be remedied after fifteen minutes upon waking up but these past couple days and even the last week has shown to be different case with extended period of time letting know of not only how I feel in a certain sense but how other through me feel. The complete shutdown fall and disaster that certain history reflect has been bear burden to even think on let alone reflect. It tells me that reflection has been in other directions. <br><br>Former friend culture of past process turned lawyers for a portion in the kind of mysterious way life can work.<br><br><br>Let knows regarding what some have done in regards to the changing of actions not reflecting what happened after the fact. A person turns on the faucet, goes about living his life after drinking a glass of water, then that action is changed as he is living his life without him knowing it. Even his memory might still reflect him turning on that faucet and yet the action could be changed. What has this been for some of the other dimensional regarding other selves and all personal? Is this phenomenon happening in other dimensional as well? The answer that I have discerned and even wrote about in past diary entries is yes. Does the android stutter on my tablet remind of dimensional construction. What exactly decent informational placement been happening in a look to the future in legal capacity sort of way. Don&#39;t want to hear about bad info placement given the nonsense that had been confronted in past and present. ways to compromise involving baddie groups to stave attack upon self in which the shoe horns later on in an excuse fashion for more baddies makes no sense at times,how about remedy in the present as well as regarding so some don&#39;t have to go those routes. What was the shit of the competition of bad supposedly good in trying to be fiscal responsible in not wasting being a bad get on the side and wonderment of what legal says about that. Why the hell should I I&#39;ll benefit for some cretens pretenderment with good clothing when I could settle for better. Just a bit of a look upon why I chose what I did.<br> <br>Gods looked i today, multiple discussions a bit turbulence with history after some search regarding latin and then gods. There was a moment where I had felt presence of Odin. I took a photo that reminded of such as well too. I also reminded that what Gods experience behind the scenes spiritually matters greatly as well and what it looked like from the light and then asked what it looked like from the Original Setting too. Really awesome dinner but then also serious talks and let knows about certain things happening. Just how important certain decisions are and the kinds of moving at times for some, part of it sometimes based upon how I operate. My anger in this life if truth upon insinuation for a small portion happens to exist and no amount of stealing anger energies in front of the scenes was going to change that even with Anger protecting portions. <br><br>I feel some have tried to get me to lash out but not solely upon audience this past 2 weeks and longer and do understand how I mean it. The kind of thing where behind the scenes spiritually put in situations to invoke anger and in obvious unfair variables as well as not obvious variables that have lent towards maneuvers not fully clouth. I felt a lifting of this spiritually. There was a situation having to do with venting upon listening to music and watching fight scenes of movie montage stardom but also classic total war in gaming prowess, at first as well as maneuvering from some but then looked to be certain conflict while I zoned out playing some tablet apps in a classic having to do with fallout shelters. I kind of freaked out at times for I didn&#39;t know why they were attaching to my actions given the wide range of resources that were available and the amount of spiritually watching sometimes even more so than upon myself and my content. I started understanding why it was that some of the clouth advocates steering this direction was a benefit but that sight of why had been muddled at times for the kind of missing exactness that was needed in identifying why it was that I cared about both that smooth blue alliance and scrappy red disposition that told of lower down holding it downs for the kind of waiting upon preparation that was already prepared and the kind of entertaining variable that existed in which the battle of mentality while waiting waning to the not stave of better prosper. Wouldn&#39;t it have been much easier to have been playing younger games in the second age of natural time for truth, why would have ever gone the ways of moving past such golden age era of what we really are trying towards again I wouldn&#39;t ever fully understand. I did know that some were not letting go of me and this process in which was still causing problems. How was I to explain that if there was something terrible taking place at times within the spirit and spiritual, other-dimensional as well as in the light for even if I knew there to be a massively larger percentage of good that I continued to experience psychic attack letting know of something darker even with the proof of good within this process much stronger, elegant and needed in the kinds of feathery get the heck out of my face and proper they had in response seen to the many ends in higher and middle places, heck even the lower areas seen magic more so stronger than some on this physical and it&#39;s not the tell of decency but rather false and true complacency in a world of preparation. If what they had been insinuating regarding conflict and attack especially personally upon myself let alone the others was true then how could I just leave and how could I just not care and when I realized in the light that the truth I had been saying down here in that fact that who needed to save for truth highest up with ease on the go button to the good could do so with ease and less work than whatever the heck it currently was with case point even if it was comfort and work with politics and family in the tangled web we weave as a part of the problem as vicious circles go, I had probably went to the wonder room to relive former glory. I still stammered for not knowing the tiny of details that would be reason but for if the Original Creator Saved self and who need be in proper manner being the quick times quickest then it might be less of the problem. The shit of it was that this Physical Space very might well be one of those ones that can be painlessly dissolved in an instant with everyone home safely. It was that kind of truth understood that was worth being revealed. It was that kind of truth worth safeguarding. It was a truth normality in how some had viewed this Space to be the small of the matter in the how wrong they were. If some had been preparing for their lives since the 2nd and 3rd age regardless of pushed back or not, the plain true had been the fact that most had prepared for good lives in the kind of reveal later on to let know to prepare for something different until it continued to look different in intervals. That point that the Original Creator and whoever else needed to be in what he indicated exactly for this paragraph had enough power to save most if not all, instantly and safely had been fortold since the beginning. Omnia. The crap of it was that I had been continuing to proceed with emphasis in regards to defense my self, defense of my own and others in who I chose even though they continued to say I needed to do more to protect and defend as well as serve self in the manner that had always been known even with hybrid styles upon debate with past selves that were far in the past understood that I had my own and that others were not only needed but cherished up to a point. Myself was included anyhow to a degree for fool purposes if need be but it was also understood within baseline quality of life attainment already attained whether it only be in spirit and mind and upon the body. What they indicated at times was that there was red tape in pushing past in the reason why some had to choose all if not most to be saved even if there large double digit percentages that wanted most if not all to be saved. It was kind of encroach upon certain white and gold for choosing stances to save most if not all, it was also a wake up call and a try in what some thought there was intervals. It was something i didn&#39;t fully understand. It was the kind of shakedown pass it on to another fireworks frame no shit kind of way but it was also a no chance in the mix for kind of vagabond need good societal clouth understanding in the smoke and mirrors of how things worked. I didn&#39;t care about certain kind and whatever shitting stupid reasons it was that I couldn&#39;t save who needed to be saved and it wasn&#39;t about writing this book. It was the spiritual quick instant miracle that can exist in recovering who needed recovering in the moment that needed be in the continues let know of truth, it wasn&#39;t just balanced by faith, logic and reason for if that was the truth existent for it would be one of the most powerful truths. It would be a bit of a kicker in the moments needed prior for if the Original Creator and Cronies had been talking about these issues in the fact of truth daily wide out in the open safely. Wouldn&#39;t it be the supporting line of the century if the it was one of the most talked about topics ever. Why wouldn&#39;t it be especially if it was a truth. The Original Creator had shadowed actions of first immorality emergence and so did later on creation, he still does to this day in certain manner even with advanced AI systems of safety as well as Technology more advanced then it was during that later Third Age and my God if it was beforehand to a certain degree. It was also the baseline tell of it all though. Those programs of good that prepared for each action needed even if in lump sums throughout ages. It wasn&#39;t just immoral action but also actions of block. When the Original Creator partially walked away from instant saving in the third partially due to being able to understand life path and potentially discern as such, he had enough power then to save most if not all. It wasn&#39;t about power. imagine having creation a berating them for gazillions of years not to create and what that kind of life path manifestation could be? What if it was discerned to have been worse. The crumb of it all is that he probably had prepared since the first, second and third age with present time still within the fourth in the kinds of advanced mathematics, science, magic and technology he was rocking but the shit of it was if there wasn&#39;t a natural anatomical that could discern as such it changed a variable worth noting even if he would use some of the listed up above to discern given any kinds of dimensional creation and construction that would take place later on. Most of which moral on such a scale as massivity that could be considered one of the wonders of the world especially if there was immorality still taking place behind spiritually. Why wouldn&#39;t it be considered as such if we did derive from self, family and morality. The kind of good that had been preparing and when you take a look at foundation tells of the truth on this within history and cartography as well as saving then the answer becomes clear. Ways of life facilitation, transportation, access and action upon the power of Time and present is a part of the answer. They always said that if higher up directions don&#39;t fully reflect what we need them to, then they cant expect realistic choices to made in front of the scenes for if the good didn&#39;t maneuver past those blocks than at what point did the weight of the world fall upon what needed for fact. That was at times that smooth blue alliance but it wasn&#39;t the only one and it was actually multi colour. They had dispositions they didn&#39;t wear on their sleeves at times for the colour of red and that disposition of need be which happened to do with saving ones own, and ones self as well as the others needed but it was a chain of connection that brought us to similar stance as the save most if not all. I knew I wasn&#39;t the bad guy. I knew I was a free form. I knew they tried to label me bad in certain places and the fact and truth of that was more than just in wide open but not nowhere as much as it needed to be. There were others like me that had discerned something, something different,  something society didn&#39;t fully understand and something we didn&#39;t fully understand, I only went so far as a part of the need be scared that I actually truly was and a part of that societal decent type that some knew me to be. I wasn&#39;t wrong for letting know of my experiences especially for what I stood for and there kinds of issues talked about. Certain kind needed to back off from my life, it was why local conflicts mattered and I had continued to lend credence towards as such for truth. <br><br>It was understood that some of the turbulence when I wrote this happened to be smoke and mirrors but that there was conflict discerned. Spiritually in how I feel things there has been those moments where I dont know or feel conflict happening but there is tells in which dont necessarily relay for the full fact of truth but that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t something taking place whether it be good or not. This one felt tense though and I did discern events after writing and before hand having to do with movement of dimensional infrastructure, changing of level of motion as well as utilization topics in regards to my process as well as interplay which did feel to be more open then what some had let one or discerned in the moment. After the writing it did feel like some maneuvered and I had discerned again conflict, fighting, alarm like atmoshperics. Eventually spiritual authorities in bigger manner arrived and I did feel higher aspects of self as well as family in vicinity in safe manner whether it be from higher spiritual aspects or not. Some were trying to lie about this process again and I dont feel I am the only one but there was also those trying to create panic in tense situation. <br><br><br>Themes: <br>#Tarot #Psychictivity #LazySundays #Judgment  #JusticeRemains #Surveys #LostEjuiceFound #PastImpressions #Lawyers #ClearSilver #Impressional #Vindication #AsAPsychicMedium #Coalitions #SpeakingNotTheProblem #McDonaldsBreakfast #BagelMourning #West #Info #SeriousDiscussions #Speaking #MomentsOfSadness #WaysOfHowIOperate #HowIWantToOperate #ToClarify #TheWhyNotEnough #ForThereWereAlwaysThose #IfMemoryServes #Correct #AreasOfThrowDownWhereTheThrowDownEnough #PentUpAgression #PentUp #PointingAgainToHighest #PointingAgainToLargestMultiDimensionalCommonRoom #TheRightOfThePlan #FriendsAndFamily #ButDontCompromiseYourMorality #SwitchGamesOfMovement #LetGoOfThisProcess #LetGoOfMe #DimensionalMovement #TooMuchBurden #Bullying #Remedies #NotLaughing #CounselingCopsThatDidn&#39;tFail #OtherGroupsNeedBe #Surfacing #UnderwaterSlowingOfMotion #ForSomeMotionMovingActuallyFasterThanWhatDiscernedPhysically #Thanks #Authorities #MoreToTheStory #WhatNeededToBeSaid #Safety #LightBloomFlourishUponThePage #Normality</div>
