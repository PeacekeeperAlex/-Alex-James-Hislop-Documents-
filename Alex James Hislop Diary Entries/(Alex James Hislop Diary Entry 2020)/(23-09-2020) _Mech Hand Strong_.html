<div class="title">(23-09-2020) &quot;Mech Hand Strong&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>This morning, felt turbulence take place and conflict, felt attacked psychically and I emphasized what my Main Spirit Guides indicated for me to emphasize specifically with literal actions from the present to the future, Rune Placement one of them when I went outside in my backyard. Explain further about future, life path and dimensional frameworks regarding. There was a thing yesterday where it looked like spiritual tried to get me to be agitated and aggressive prompt in regards to trying to blame me for certain things that were a time later in my backyard deck. It felt like bombs maneuvering upwards and certain kinds of launches. It might not have been what was insinuated in the kind dimensional warfare that was told through subtle manners in what it might have been another was a tell about certain physicals on this earth noting similar phenomenon spiritually without being able to speak fully physically about it who really have less to do with that sort of things that even I as Innocent as I am. A tell though also is that in which has to do with certain kind perpetuating certain actions to affect my writing in my diary entries specifically when talking about specific subjects. Making it more unclouth to talk about such subjects.<br><br>-----------<br><br>I talked more about sports, BMX and Skateboarding, Nascar and even European racing, horse racing and snowborading as well as other kinds of sports in identifying characteristics that might be similar and a part of the previous Diary Entry let know regarding Spiritual Sports correlating with such characteristics of physicals sports specifically on Global and National scales across earth. There was also underground version of what I had been identifying.<br><br>I had known that there is frameworks in regards to life that lends towards other spiritual experiencing my life in certain ways. Some of this consented but some of it not so. Big fat not so. But it got me thinking to the kinds of things I can do in regards to my life that would especially help the roller coaster kinds of unable to change certain actions if not all of them upon this life track. Like doing advocations or even simplistic let knows of Gaming Missions to be accomplished. Again imagine a digital overlap in regards to certain life where the physical and even certain spiritual are viewed similarly to certain NPCs with life that are hard track kind of interaction with more free flowing spiritual even through digital and which isnt to say there isn&#39;t certain things that can make certain hard tracks more flexible  but just that there is things within life that some would do daily if they had a knowing regarding some of what they know later on after passing on.  I wanted to spitball what kinds of things that could be to be true. It something I need to think on.<br><br>I spoke about gaming and it seemed to be a certain kind of day of reflection and coherency in remembering certain spiritual and culture that have passed through here but also rememberalls of certain situations.<br><br>There had been tells of certain kind of family yesterday, certain kind that seemingly I feel in certain situations do like my kind of grimey free speech and saving activism that has heavy emphasis with sarcasm. It was a small part of that strange wake up and freak out again kind of situations that speaks to why some dislike certain kind of utilization in certain moments unclouth and just because one can dig unclouth doesn&#39;t mean that certain unclouth is acceptable. There was also this clash of certain personality regarding myself in who I consider myself to be. Maybe some like pink more than some thought. But it one of those ones where I could see how some saw me in certain manners in which I might have equated to more in line with myself and the other personalities that might have been less prominent in regards to certain perception but also other kinds different than perception. This again spoke of the kind of cultures that like certain aspects of people and spiritual and view them as such in contrast with that in which views people and spiritual more encapsulating as to who one considers themselves to be and it is interesting that both views can have their unclouths regarding, like a person who might consider himself to be more than the personality he is wearing but doesn&#39;t want spiritual to note that or say that. <br><br>I have still noted filmaking culture around me and focusing on specific scenes regarding certain movies in certain moments in which I surmise that some of the filmaking has had to do with certain situations that lend towards filmaking and specific scenes but its also more than that in which I am unable to fully articulate at this time. <br><br>Personality was spoken of after identifying a potential in regards to some of the classic archetype of brown sitting their cup down in vicinity of certain spiritual and people. I had wondered what it was about and I don&#39;t know if it was just brown. That&#39;s a tell. I discerned it to be multiple colours due to an interaction that wasn&#39;t just single colour related for what&#39;s acceptable. But the conversation went to that sort of thing in which identified personalities as separate and their own spiritual and other-dimensional as well as in coloring in front of the scenes beings own personalities. For me as a physical I had continued to let know that I am those kinds of personalities that my Main Spirit Guides listed in my own way in line for portions but also not so for others too a degree understood in certain other-dimensional areas. Discussions ensued spiritually after some explanations explained.<br><br>A certain thing about family this day on my end but maybe other ends too, it almost looked like a spiritual regarding caring and compassionate but especially that in which identifies that many of us are family to eachother in the light and other-dimensional, there is just as enlightened dimensional akin to the light culture described through spiritualist writings on this planet physically and spiritually that should be recognized more within earth-based writings and might very well be as I haven&#39;t even scratched the surface in regard to reading some of the spiritualists writings that exist on this Earth at least physically. I don&#39;t know if it was fully that this day because I have noted other kinds trying to facilitate directions albeit in different manners and even in different directions even if still reminded of this kind of direction but this hasn&#39;t always been bad and I have noted good regarding and to be true I am wondering if there was certain kinds of tryouts for other spiritual behind the scenes through me regarding different kinds of family styles and things of that nature. How does this correspond with the kind of construction and building that some have been doing as of late regarding what i spiritually and other dimensional wise upon some of my household and hearth in which I note there is more of a friendly family vibe as of late and it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to do with bad things taking place. The reader might be confused as to why that is said but it&#39;s to help spiritually behind the scenes and in other capacities that have thought it might have something to do with that or were told that when that isn&#39;t necessarily the case. Sometimes it&#39;s an anti-camp decent measure? It&#39;s the clouth of understanding at times certain cultural normalities in either direction.<br><br><br><br>Defense:<br>People and Spiritual that live with their parents.<br>Those spiritual and other-dimensional that have repaired my electronics partially by way of the blatant red flags that have been observed.<br><br>Themes:<br>#Underground #Sports #Gaming #Happiness #Knowing #Future #Battle #LifeTimeLines #Frameworks <br></div>
