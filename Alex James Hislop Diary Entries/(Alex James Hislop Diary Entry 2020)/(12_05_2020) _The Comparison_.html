<div class="title">(12/05/2020) &quot;The Comparison&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I had woken up with a not wanting to continue kind of feeling and reminded of that moment earlier where certain kind affected my spirit for what some have been labelling spirit even though the wording itself pertain to more than that. I dont care about what kind of good it can do, especially when we dont have to go that direction to achieve good. I dont want to go that direction to achieve good for the kind of compromised morality in facilitating the supposed crazy. It&#39; not callous to feel that my spiritual selves and aspects of selves shouldn&#39;t be attacked for some jankier route that still floats bad actions and crumb ways of proceeding. I do care about Green, their not the only colour. Magenta isn&#39;t the only colour either. Pink, Red and Purple as well as White are not the only colours. Regardless, I dont want to have to suffer for stupid choices that some haven&#39;t made and for some of the choices that some have made. That last sentence being feng shuied in some sort of darker way masked as an opportunity to heal the bad might be a part of the problem if it wasn&#39;t for the true good intervention that spoke of a realism and reality regarding. I am not the only one, my problems aren&#39;t the only kind. I had wondered if it really boiled down to how some of the bad spiritual have maneuvered and what kind of crazy town pretendersville nonsense in the kind of former baddies going the janky way badsville style. Where were the good in regards to some of the corruption that was taking place in the past. Cold coffee could be the remedy. Watching some television could be the correct medicine as well. How about exactly what I had indicated in regards to this content in regards to this sentence in how my Main Spirit Guides chose for me to choose for this sentence. It was more in line with what other Guideships had indicated, except that it wasn&#39;t the charletons pretending to be Guideships, it happened to be the exact Guideships of those reading this novel by way of safety within moral parameter. The answer was that Guideship information regarding was being displayed as well as countless other ways that a single parameter line can express. It was a normality variable that existed. I wasn&#39;t trying to use this outlet to take advantage of something many loved on this planet in ways unclouth but if some of the things I had written happened to be true unto me, then I sure as hell thought about it. Anyhow, it was one of the inflections at times for a need be capacity to safeguard in the expanded info about this novel and no other author had to do a let know in live dimensional wording to be safeguarded as such either, I didn&#39;t have too either to be true but maybe there was a natural benefit for some of it and maybe it wasn&#39;t the kind of need be survival benefit for some with already covered up to a point understood and there was outlet offered by the good in many different capacities. Order wasn&#39;t the only one around and it wasn&#39;t just these days even with understanding of not having to use aesthetics that made theatrical happy and maybe understanding that theatrical could be facilitated in ways that made just as happy if not more so given not having to worry about woes of misunderstanding.<br><br>The point towards the chosen one in the mix regarding multi-dimensional common rooms in the largest that exist in knowing it happened to be good for a large portion happened to be true. It had happened early morning after a discernment of Justice and Judgment upon the numbers eleven twenty. A certain friend reminded of that in a certain sense and his younger spiritual self I had discerned to be in spirit and reviewing with father and creator. What that meant I didn&#39;t fully know for the reality of what it truly looked like but it might be exactly as it sounds. A handful of times brought up in this process and hadn&#39;t seen too much of him even with another friend brought up via dreams and the kind of storylines some trying to say certain events had to do with falling at the seams. For it was supposedly me, one of the physicals in the mix. Somehow past memory let know of certain problems had also let know of the kinds of had to deal with unfairness for the kind of association that was supposedly the problem and less to do with especially upon my vindication factor. A physical didn&#39;t have to clarify there own name everyday, some just understood and it wasn&#39;t just God. Somehow the biblical remembrance of first names was understood invoke memory and understanding in certain physicals as to the ability to transcend having to have numeric attatchments to each name but at least those that did as such were being responsible, there was a spiritual variable of understanding and a soul name regarding whether it be many names or few. It was a simple one too for some when you think of how easy it really was for certain kind to understand for the some odd physical humans on this planet and when you think of other dimensional and spiritual that it had less to do with being a simple one or not but rather having to do with something else. It spoke of reality. It spoke of clear choice. It spoke that there was that good spirituality the earth-based physical had been speaking of in many different manners, not just in some other interaction are as well as for all those times of cry out dont leave or why the hell did you take so long to get back sort of nonsense that should not have been and didn&#39;t have to be. There were those moments for some in spiritual were a light group making its rounds not to be seen again for some times in which did frighten at times that didn&#39;t make sense to me because it didn&#39;t have to be for some crap compromise. For some it wasn&#39;t a compromise. What some also forgot in the explaining was that there were those areas in which it was always good. The heavens and paradises as well as dimensional areas that spoke of that normal societal variable that the Original Creator relayed again in regards to this writing that was around physicals not only on this planet but others as well. <br><br>I had seen something when I had woken up today and it told of the simplicity that God had probably pointed towards especially for spiritual variables of this physical planet earth as well that had to do with the fact that most if not all were a certain kind of innocent. The Plants, Insects, Elements and Animals, the Earth itself and then of course you had the humans. How important that variable of influence and manipulation seen upon some of the physical criminals became stark and contrasted. The Animals had a pass but somehow in whatever the hell had happened sometimes upon waiting there seemed to be that in which couldn&#39;t just get enough. But it wasn&#39;t enough. It wouldn&#39;t be enough. It was understood for what it was but given understanding of spiritual and how some of the choices that certain physicals made were influenced at times by those that didn&#39;t care if some in front of the scenes turned bad as well as the other variables noted had made it clear that all on this physical planet earth were a certain kind of innocent. The simplistic of fact as to where most if not all of came from had also given way to that societal normality variable. The variable that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to the communications they let know of in regards to this writing, and it was referenced that way when said, that societal normality variable for safety purposes. The Cross referencing to understand God and my Main Spirit Guides was interesting given the interjection that saved. It had to do with writing. Maybe Pennywise was an Angel or a Dog of God. Maybe Both. On the subject itself what would the prominent in regards to that societal normality variable say and what would the contrast be upon those names I had referenced and called upon near my kitchen stove with my arms wide open. <br><br>I had called upon that common room for a reason. It was a normal to call upon them. Many would say there was nothing wrong with that and maybe they could only so far but maybe it was far enough. Again given the rights issue I had discerned at times in overlap in regards to me as well as the potential of other things, I feel that the spiritual that invoked me to call upon them was in the correct. Dont get it mistaken though that I did also call upon my highest that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and there were some trying to pretend to be authorities they werent as well as authorities that were not my authorities. I wasn&#39;t the only one who called upon Highest of Self for what one considered self in what Guidance relayed. Many were a part of their own Guideships and Guidance worked closely with those Guideships. I even talked about the kind of thing where we shouldn&#39;t have too call upon highest to be experiencing that normal societal variable. I was talking spiritually, like my Guardian Angels shouldn&#39;t have to call upon God for me to be able experience that societal normality variable. It was one of those things where if we look to the past on that silent variable and non-silent variable in which God relayed, and some trying to use the excuse of some not communicating for help as to the reason for certain past events regarding, didn&#39;t seem good enough at all. </div>
