<div class="title">(21/10/2020) &quot;Desired, Chosen and Promised&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I woke up to music in a something strange regarding morality, there was goodness discerned but also the energies and situation reflected something bad happening. It was like I could here on my end of the songs a tell that coincided with subtle communicational about angry with upwards and that battle was taking place. I should be able to let know of battle on these diary entries without impacting the reader negatively and it reminded of a conversation in how certain spiritual view things, like going through a ring of fire to have to get to decent interaction when we have seen there not to have to be that in literal as well as ability and potential, meaning you don&#39;t have to experience bad things to get to decent interaction and many on this planet already understand that spiritually and subconsciously and this might coincide with understand the moral correct nature of fair and discerning the difference between unfair. I feel it extends beyond by way of the Rights granted by Highest Authorities in the Natural Original Setting but also by way of many Authorities that in certain capacities are holding it down for that granting of rights. Maybe it was Non-Authorities that were silently loud in letting know of this fact even if surmised on my end in which doesn&#39;t negate the fact. There was a tell of safeguarding culture and items, the discernment on my end has been that there are ways to transport the items without dissolvment and re-apparition, in what would remind of the transporter from star trek. That there are viable and real ways to move items in bulk 100% safe to the items themselves just as good as before to the item safe areas. Organized and understood. In fact, in the styles where employed, just because there is a quick flash of instant transportation in what seems to be a movement thought to affect items, doesn&#39;t actually mean to what one thinks it might pertain. Meaning that the quick instant flashes of movement of items are in fact safe and for some partial aesthetic in understanding those items are safe via that kind of transportation method. Some were equating the aesthetic seen in transportation and extrapolating items affected in certain manners in which they are upon being partially correct in the right to bring up given the importance of items especially when you factor for some of the items the life held in multiple manners. This reminded me of a topic brought up earlier in the shadowing of actions regarding the kind of phenomenon of transportation the exists that reminds that there are multitudes of good on the same side and even within the same direction safeguarding others actions in transportation and saving. The kinds of aesthetic I discern that many like for item transportation happens to be related in seeing the item whole through portals where it can go to just as high up places as the quick instant flash and it can be done near as quick. It bring up aesthetic utilization to facilitate culture in the great moving taking place.<br><br>I had a thought to remedy something. It was the idea to give warfare something just as good if not better to replace older forms of defense. I thought it was a good idea. I figured something out earlier, it had to do with utilization. I realized I loved certain soldiers that listened to music even if during the battle and I didn&#39;t think there was anything wrong with listening to music during battle and even utilization of music in certain fashions I felt to be justified but there was certain kinds of utilization in which I frowned upon. Maybe it wasn&#39;t a barring of that in which the utilization was about but rather the utilization itself.<br><br>A cool culture of lavender and soft blue came around today, it felt good to feel the willfully subdued tones of garnering consent and the let know of care that exists within such a kind evident even in clash with rabbit of tricks let known to be good. I realized this culture from a pinterest search and it lets know of strength within interaction and the experiences from that strength even if misunderstood at times. Upon the sight of clarification for such misunderstandings in grant becomes what one wanted to be. It reminded of artists that made a song that too was misunderstood at times for even with the let know of multiple kinds of good this day for why then the bad? I surmised one of the answers on my end was supposedly akin to protecting ones own bad. I thought for then why the lock upon the experiences to facilitate the ways of life needed so that the bad could still be bad without harming? Silence. Might have been the real answer over the backpedal strong on the march. I didn&#39;t know the connection fully as to why this group came around me today. Someone said it had to do with cool but maybe it had to do with acting. Before hand I cut my hair in mohawk style and an attempt at Spaniard mustache, I was feeling happy if not a little gay. Switching up ones style could change life, acting understood what that meant and upon yesterdays midway through the Jackal argumentative. There just seemed to be some pent up energy and needed venting of truth, reason and lies in which I didn&#39;t have the full clue as to how far it really went and how some viewed the smaller matters supposedly to be bigger ones recognized not in size but importance even if without import. I mean I said it the other day, the amount of Agencies around me was astounding but it wasn&#39;t just agencies for some it was entire nations and banners sometimes within the shirt itself. The organization regarding such logistics and manpower lent really did matter, I wondered if the bigger out there in regards to some of what some thought were small to these events were getting situated which made me conflicted between the questioning as to why bigs regarding these kinds of events were not situated already and the questioning as to why the smalls were being looked past. The answer was there in front of me in balancing act of situating the fourth age in which leads to the fifth. There has been struggles of interaction noted within the past four to five days even though a great portion has been good, I feel that realism approach regarding mattered greatly. I realized that there were those that felt like things were going too quickly but somehow my care and love for family as well as what that extended towards later on in not wanting to disappoint as well seeing from another perspective as well as pacing wouldn&#39;t be strong enough to bear burden of the kind of death and suffering, lost alone and whatever the heck else was in that grouping that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this communication. I felt bad because I knew there was bad who felt gypped upon the promises of getting by but I also knew the kind of timeframes passing in the light, or least certain specific light, billions of years per physical second and I also knew what I chose in not only my heart of hearts. For how some treated heart of heart chosen as well as choosings in the higher up of having to choose realistic choice in front of the scenes might has well been silent. I was being proven wrong on the last was also a part of the conflict of self even with recognizing choice being chosen in front of the scenes for realism in the higher up however there going to take to save so we could get back to the promised lands of living life in the form of experiencing life as desired and chosen as well as promised. <br><br>Worked on digits having to do with humanity. There had been talk that somehow, that there was potentially specific events regarding humanity past 2 days. Large energy interactions and things going smooth for what I could see but some trying to smoke and mirrors. Having to do with interaction for some of it but I had wondered what else on other ends.
