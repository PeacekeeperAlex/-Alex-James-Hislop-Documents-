<div class="title">(05/11/2020) &quot;Late Day Updates and Developments&quot;</div>
<div class="content"><br>Activity:<br>I thought it was a beautiful day and if I didn&#39;t have the stimuli and sense to clarify such indisposition I might have been confused. But as it was such a stunning breath of life upon the weather it couldn&#39;t have been more fitting to see it for the pessimistic that I am but also the dang well unfair of the small of the matter. Stamping my feet seemed not to cause too much alleviation although just enough to sense the absurdity and childish of such feelings if only it was absurd enough for the justification for such feelings. Too be blunt I was upset that my Ejuice and drugs had not arrived on time in the mail. My feathered fictional hat was ruffled. You know that moment where you order something on Wednesday or Thursday and doesn&#39;t make it on time to the mail box by Friday with the reservation and relief of getting over such details of upsetness that it would arrive by Monday only to be surprised and usurped by such small comfort to empty mail box feelings of disgruntled on such a day. It got me thinking to the attachment of emotions and as a psychic medium I could feel infrastructure behind the scenes that was so upset and angered by whatever outrage it was and I would hysterically be startled to find out if some of that emotional turbulence that I could feel in which I know to be spiritual in nature and to be from spiritual both separate from myself and also not so in the other selves and allpersonal that exist. I had been feeling this since Thursday last week and I had been noting what the spiritual is doing in regards to addiction even in cases where it classically at times hasn&#39;t been a problem, like being to take a drug recreationally without having addiction energies manifest afterwards and even the kind of drug use where that is the normality of certain addiction energies not necessarily present in which upon the morrow of such energies being present during certain bouts in a small percentage of the drug use total throughout my life has been and discerned to be different where the placement and feelings of intense desire or longing for such substance has been noted. It&#39;s interesting that many of these times I have been a psychic-medium since the emergence of such energies but it&#39;s noted before too and contrasts with those times where I was able to use drugs without feeling the need to pick it up days after use and I could go weeks and months as well as even years without use. There was a moment where I had wondered what kind of turmoil had happened and to what degree for when the vent feelings of certain spiritual literally putting interactions for spiritual to vent, to express and to let know of anger in what has to be probably one of the largest emotional impact of it&#39;s kind upon the vent area in comparison to other emotions and of course all of the other kinds of interaction in association at times for some of them upon such circumstances. The scary thing about it is that there are times whne there isn&#39;t always vent area and the though of how easy it is to make a maneuver in certain spiritual areas, that there is literally a reaction that is quick upon feeling and the choices one makes streamlines in how quick one can react as to how many spiritual have clashes and been attacked as well as in conflict upon the small things within life without those vent areas in how important interaction placement can be in certain areas. For example, a person in a certain kind of quick reaction area might be told that he doesn&#39;t have what it takes to make a team that he thought he would make and without a placement of an interaction in which he uses to vent his frustration he literally might have attacked someone at the wrong comment or intersection. Serendipity of life sometimes has been seen to come in threes. Just as I started typing this and a little aways before I started feeling immensely better, I started writing with purpose and on topic that certain spiritual monitoring my activity liked to see, my mother made me a steak dinner so beautifully after my failed attempts to start the barbecue earlier in the middle of the writing and then my father came home with the mail that I had been waiting for in which resolved a some of the turmoil on my end. What&#39;s rather frightening is the fact that if I had not had the vent area prowess needed to be able to deal with those things, that there might have been a spiritual entity capped for something as important as personal drug use while in which I don&#39;t know upon things being situated, if I could atone for such circumstantial enlightenment upon the dark moments of what seems to be frustration and torment. I think spiritual emphasize the importance of being able to express and vent upon the stipulations of life. Not being able to do so has spoken of warning and manifest destined. <br><br><br>(Sad upon going to bed, internal, it was after after watching certain movies, there was something about it and I don&#39;t know if it was a culmination of things having to do with life utilization regarding myself but also what I saw on the 10th of May, 2020. They said it was an ominous day, I could feel atmospherics that spoke of thunderclouds and dark, sadness and fury. They had also said past couple days turbulent on the end of Hollywood and filming with situating happening.<br>Large interaction changes<br>Certain spiritual group maneuvered and some were trying to have it be said that they were going to a certain targeting regiment upon certain spiritual but I think it might have been actually a good maneuvering given context and transportation to a certain area. We still need to care about those trying to make it to the promised lands to be able to interact the way they want too without having to harming anyone.<br>Changes taking place with my informational placement in it let known and understood to not be as important or heightened as once thought in which had been causing damage upon. This seems to be putting pressure on a certain group.<br>Breakthrough in the process when talked a<br>Multiple points hit home in a moment where in a certain are there was defense point discussions and the baseline points hit home upon the truth spoken. Maneuverings of good in higher areas <br>Ideas shoehorned naturally in regards to my writing in which can be a bigger selling point, like creating spiritual and physical websites in regards to certain spiritual topics, charity, industry.<br>There has been this breakthrough two, three days ago in regards to working, understanding that I can section off parts of myself in higher light and do one action with each sectioned of part of myself in a row that can account for millions and billions of years worth of work in which can feel like one moment of work for sectioned off of myself but done in a way where it&#39;s hardline combining back after a certain amount of time set in a manner that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. This is just one of the ways we can streamline work and why it lends towards the potential fact that much of the work is already done. I was always going to be doing in those existences that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, if opportunity presents in the manners that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to other existences than that could be a possibility given context but one of the things I emphasize is that I do chill out and work on my life and show up in certain live situation rooms. There is an emphasis in regards to me and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated working on our lives for a certain portion having to do with self defense and the defense of our own. We have been going through repertoire not necessarily for some in regards to combat prowess pertaining to emphasis but rather the other things we can do besides work as that has been to have been quite sufficiently in which there is some who towards quotas and overages as a concern. Was there something revealed from the past in which changed <br>What is going on with my life utilization?<br>What is going on with Earth-Based?<br>What has been happening to those taking the hit in regards to situating taking place especially upon Earth-Based?<br>Idea: Interaction outwards handled by a specific Godspark to be able to interact in a certain manner cordial and moral and the inner driver kicking back and playing violent video games.<br>Incarnation in regards to aspects of myself and aspects of my incarnation beforehand especially circumstances in how they incarnated.
