<div class="title">(04/13/2020) &quot;The Jets of Washington&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I woke up and there was this dream, I was running on planet and it was like star wars when there was cinematic shots of lone being on speeder and how there is that open space of the planet. There was this moment where a voice, maybe a narrator but I don&#39;t know if that is fully what it is and it let know that I was done. There was a story about my incarnation once and some said that somehow I screwed up, at times, it might have been the case but the maneuvering of my direction matters and considering what took place should be understood for what it was truly, but I still feel I am from Higher Light, it is what I discern and some of been trying to harass that line at times. There is aspects of incarnation in regards to my incarnation and there is other as well in which I have been advocating for situating in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.They say one wrong move can lead towards disaster but that isn&#39;t always true and often times is not. We live our lives but that doesn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t try to be careful. I am not certain if it was the crossing of a threshold that some would classically point towards or if it was before but I am from Higher Light and if I incarnated from Higher Light like I feel to have done so then there is a strong possibility that I am of the True Good and regardless I am of the True Good now. I am of the percentages that my Main Spriit Guides indicated in the Light in the Capacities that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. I have continued to say it regularly throughout the past five years. I saw ships emerge and could feel the psychictivity regarding in which the stimuli hasn&#39;t gone away fully upon waking up and before I woke up I could see in the sky a flash of independence day, literally a scene from that and then quick cut back to the dream I was experiencing beforehand in which saw multiple planets with crates and partially breaking apart and then it felt like ships crashing into me except that somebody protected me with their hands. Hands of Dream. <br><br>I woke up and here we go again. Impressions and let knows that certain kind maneuvered forces in regards to a certain kind of vicinity and shooting outwards feeling in regards to similar energies and these energies similar to the space and time in which kind of felt like I was put in an orbit curve. I know I have been moving way higher in a certain space overlap that is emphasized even by way of looking at space in which I continue to climb and move upwards, cleaner energies and movement in other dimensional as well. Airplane feeling is some of it to be true for a portion at times. Don&#39;t mistaken though I am still on Earth and should be, I have continued to say that I should still be on Earth in multiple capacities as well as in the Dimensional Areas that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. Overlaps happening discerned, time line movement shaped like ships crashing into each other though seemingly in a safe manner. Then some of the timelines and dimensions, in which can be one and the same for some of them potentially moving overlapping me, one of them might be that large high up space energy I am able to feel and then another one told by way of interaction and considered maybe lower down to the one previous having more to do with Washington energies and seems to be more present and closer. Don&#39;t mistaken there is a power within these things and that there is multiple present interaction that exists and in is still in interaction with myself for a portion and there is present in regards to those times lines that my Main Spriit Guides indicated, a straight line of experience in which a present is happening upon the pointers and lines themselves for portion. There has been a discernment of times in regards to certain life utilization that should not be mistaken for something else<br><br>I had this Notion and Understanding as well as Truth in regards to my life and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to my life and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated for when I stop working there is spiritual and others kinds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that take over for a certain work load but that we still maintain that there are moments where some of us if not all of us don&#39;t work in multiple kinds of capacities. <br><br>I think here are aspects of my incarnation that are going to higher light with me and other dimensional areas for the portion that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this life itself and others lives that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. That might be something that exists for certain spiritual and physical not just on this planet but others as well. <br><br>Tells of incarnation and certain feelings regarding being situated and feeling why they exist like old feelings on oneself changing.<br><br>I felt jets impressions and impressions of Washington. There seems to be some trying to emphasize earth-based.<br><br>High pitch fart smell as well to be true. High Pitch Sulfur. Really High Pitch Sulfur.<br><br>One of the questions is what the heck happened <br><br>So there was life being lived by before this life as Alex James Hislop, we know there to be other dimensional selves at times in regards to certain incarnation. The physical perspective of Alex James Hislop, the driver of the Physical Body and what his Main Spirit Guides indicated, in which the physical perspective of Alex James Hislop hypothesizes that he is from higher light but he has recognized that there was incarnate life that his Main Spriit Guides indicated below him in which is now technically a part of him in a certain capacity for a portion not only in regards to his incarnation but for some of them in regards to other things as well. What happened in those lives that were below him while he was in higher dimensional if that is the case. The lens of present and situation as well as the looking glass should be upon some of those moments that my Main Spriit Guides indicated regarding. The lack of acknowledgment in regards to things done to save has been clear. Maybe more clear than the acknowledgment itself in some areas.<br><br>All throughout the day spirits chirping that I need to be working on something and I had been feeling a bit crummy about it to a certain degree but considering the past 13 days I wasn&#39;t too worried. They continue to try and say that somehow the turbulence happening is my fault but not really in other places as well and then a stage is set not even then and yet still attacks happening. Near the end of the day I decided to do something about it because partially because of a variable known that said that I should be working more on Earth-Based for follow up advocations I would do in regards to multiple topics and themes. I would create many advocations that are decent and only pertain to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in which my Main Spriit Guides are defined by my Main Spirit Guides in the Light with my Main Spirit Guides information in the Original taking precedence. Time Board, Immorality Board, AJH Daily Defensives Board and the Banner Board as well as others in which I then segwayed to the United Nations Board. I created Lists with Earth and Earth-Based Disclaimers as well as United Nations Disclaimers coupled with Earth-Based Companies Disclaimers and copied and pasted throughout the Countries Lists that I had created on the Peacekeeperalex Trello Account. I got halfway to Ireland before making the Board Public. The accumulation of links shown to the Earth disclaimers and Earth-Based Disclaimers alone was worth it especially if I completed it on the 14th of April.<br><br>MIB discussions while working on United Nations Board in which segwayed to watching the MIB Music Video. Then a list of music. <br><br>Watching a list of music, the Verve, God Interaction, Sadness Prime, Music and God Energies. Felt like a Light </div>
