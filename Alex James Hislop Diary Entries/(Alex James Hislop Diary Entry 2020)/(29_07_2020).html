<div class="title">(29/07/2020)</div>
<div class="content"><br>Activity: <br>Calm in the morning. I thought it to be reflection to be the air needed. Going through back in what has happened this past month, surreal moments. Talks of Not even showing up to the End, moments of spoken earlier on experiences for stage and life in a strange segway of remembrance in the morning of what exactly some of it really is and the knowing the cultures that have been through this process and others. Maybe it was Earth letting know too, because some of it was Earth&#39;s process in reflection of some of the spiritual at times, but it wasn&#39;t just earth, it was also Sol, Solar System Star. It was also Space. Of course he other dimensional and Spiritual matter but the tells of why some of them came around me and others has been seen but for some it never made sense. There was the front lawn gathering of shapers and resources makers, dream facilitators and Transport spiritual, Venture in the mix. Octopus and Squid, Doddo and the Moth, Butterfly and Cow, Rex and Raptor. There were others as well but brought up in subtle fashion to be shaping happening but not just upon species shaping but also species lifespan and History. Greys thought of in passing, Green and Grey. The darker dance in smoke and the grey sad that exists. One of them reminds of Neutrality but I also feel they have advanced spiritually in changes that already happened to protect them. What I sense as a psychic medium is high vibrations upon their ships, especially the round silver, but also upon anatomical with real photos of such upon online to prove. Silver and Gold storylines reminding of the brilliance and sleek that exists through transcendance of dimensional and non-dimensional. talks of arrival in the wind with half bean ships floating in the sky and pleadians just a distant thought away. Real spiritual and beings that exist that have been guiding, some of them from Far Away. Maybe it was connected for some of them in what happened at times in this process for Good. Tears told of healing, spiritual use lending towards creation and darker trade scaring beyond measure. You ever see a light being cry light. Story moments of theatrical realism that you cant underestimate that you sometimes can change but the road winding remembered spoke of Truth too much to traverse back towards and said it wouldn&#39;t be like last time. Vampires and Origins seen the skipping stone and caught the scent, safeguarding species in existence and non-existence understood through and for reason and aristocracy tendencies, immortal ways that survive. Societal movement of situating and revelation, both good and bad. The Morality seen through this process changing perceptions of villainy and healing mend spoken of in many ways. Civility reigns free in knowledge of History and Events. You never knew how important such informational and energetic mattered such. Connection falling secure and synchronicity providing a key. Music, I wondered what it would be for those that didn&#39;t know or understand of such a Concept. There were those that didn&#39;t know and didn&#39;t grasp what it meant to be what one wanted to be. The Good kind. The ways of life facilitation to be able to have the bad be facilitated existed and I didn&#39;t understand at times, less so than most regarding my physical proximity, cries out of bring us back home in the etches of time. I went to the spirit, I looked at the inspiration, I felt inspired and I thought of the beginnings, when he looked the looking glass. A subtle if it might make it through and for yeah some theatrical intent of the remembrance of what it was when the good came back and remembered even though they swore they would never come back to help us, the rest. Light infrastructure in the past on the mind, I never seen such a light setup before to clarify and make sure that the Light was being represented properly in the frame set and how proceeding at times in regards to this process of a certain kind making themselves understood for why they don&#39;t deserve to be harmed for feeling that the dissolving back to the Original Setting storyline known to even exist especially upon the if I am not here in front of the scenes and you do not have the information from higher dimensional and other kinds of dimensional proper from who need regarding me and feeling for the painless dissolving back to the Original Setting and other kinds Non-Lethal and there is for what&#39;s acceptable for the Warrior exists. There was many kinds though. One of which reminds of the people. On this planet, the look of this has been Gold at times, the sunshine and Golden realms even seen within the Near Death Experience accounts physically. The peoples Champion Exists and can be in line more with societal given restraint from other ends at times. Tells of buffer and maneuvering in different routes. Reminds of moving culture that had been around in this process as well. Charity earlier as well upon some of the arrival grouped together in remembrance of Unity. Small dances to song emphasizing what this process is about more than some ever could have imagined. Hospital visits steeped in updates and dimensional deployments. Hollywood remembrance and reminders of last month green science haze in the second month on my end of Weed pursuits. The different garble, gamble and jargon  of such a trade and interaction. Old wise man sit down calm tell of the better younger days. The Ancients watching in generational throughdoms. The bigger than life never seemed more explained. What the hell what it that was more than life that some in the spirit spoke firmly. Translation at times speaking of the same thing but needs met and case point set. Chess. Or was it Checkers. Layers of awakenings sometimes beyond for safety. Present and Past dancing. What genre of Dance on this planet. Contemporary seemed perfect but there was a style understood on this planet and it&#39;s the brilliance of terminology. The mahogany taste of a certain film at the end of the month on the 27th of July 2020 and early morning 28th of July 2020. There is a scene of classic defense teams walking towards the camera which spoke it all to me. Intimacy overlaps looks either way where&#39;d it go kind of stuff. God force extreme upon a fury professional kick door down who done it, not going to do it and clarify understood in the 70s funk if need be. A certain kind of Music spoke. Concept Park and Non-Concept Park was always meant to be Good I feel, but specifically Jurassic Park I feel was always meant to be Good. It was just understanding the darker facilitation of some of it that seemed to throw some for a loop. Talks of Prison Quality of Life and the good facilitation that can exist, Library expanded. Battles of self evident at times in what I used to note more personal. Life Timelines connected kind of stuff turned situated to house realms. The look is a god damn cause there is that billions upon gazillions if not more kind of stare from the inside sometimes. Talks of Jesus and international pipes, Hinduism and Blue Light. Dark indigo themes remembrance of Thunder and the brilliant Gold lightning. Animism moments of looks from the cliffs continued, in those moments of saving and staving but providence need fourth at times provided. Angels shook, awoken, risen and move on attitude. Interaction Guardians being said too many times but maybe not enough. Else was the sort of feeling of the communicational movement. The different exist in what kinds there can be and at what point does it start to look like emergence of specific concepts throughout concepts. United Nations and the look upon me writing and other writing informational placement safety information that can lend and save, specifically how portions of earth-based feel regarding such a topic specific. The spiritual and other dimensional showing up and keeping neighborhoods safe, safeway sunlight. Early month blues reflection. The Mend Gatherings in watch upon. Family staying safe and the tells of process situating and the cave systems of life timelines in actions and non-actions, with spiritual being able to stop and go at will if needed and of course those that didn&#39;t want that. You lie in the connotation of 2020 seemed strange beyond a measure acceptable but July kind of seemed to note as such. Winter reflection near every month, walk in winter and wartime. Peace and sunshine. The kinds of other-dimensional setups they have used to save during wartime show cased at times. Battle facilitation thanks upon some of the frozen lakes. The Ocean platforms working well too in that blue under the sea reflection of another life.

Consulting the Woods seemed prudent and the understanding seemed clear and the side stuff jokes. Earth Angel playing in the background. Angels waking up through and maybe it was the romance of such doing it&#39;s job. <br><br></div>
