<div class="title">(10/10/2020) &quot;The Natural Original Setting State&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>It was both the answer to save the past in the present as well as saving the present to save past which protected the future. It made realized ways of life that spiritual live in the future but that there is not only a natural science regarding the present but also regarding Natural Time in which was surmised to be within the Natural Original Setting State. The during and potentially after was to point higher up above if there was a beyond to say they deserve saving. So within the Atheism approach an instillment of Morality that spoke of Good on levels that some did not realize even within the neutral approach. How would it be one of the most sacred religions thought to be a conflict to other religions in which upon looking at statistics for predominant had to do with Saving would it be the knowledge of if there is something else out there upon arriving at what some think to be the Natural Original Setting State especially when you interject the kind of Faith and Hope instilled in Science regarding Origin and bringing together of both Science and Faith for if there is a possibility that something else lies beyond in what could be told to be most true to Morality for continuing to try to help in such a state as a just in case. For the Atheism itself was a prayer at times for some in ways that even in how physicals on this planet have seen Atheism and Spirituality to be in their physical live interaction didn&#39;t fully understand. The interest of contrast upon such an interplay reminded me of family and friends spiritually fighting through film and sports upon the depiction remaining being a remainder in which might rival the desire of understanding that it doesn&#39;t have to be the only remainder. I noted things within film and I thought that the cool of such an overlap to be able to watch physical tab of certain films depicting the last of the fight and/or the tell of the fight with such love and compassion that hasn&#39;t been seen before or so said. Colour being a prophet and Non-Color the Faith. Understanding clouths obviously was fairly important and seemed to be related to some of the topics. It was a common sense variable of some of the simplistic supposed on this planet. Batman reminded of Common Sense in realism by way of suiting up on the broken down no way never. It was to be easy for him in dawning the opposite colour in the kind of love he had for peoples he wasn&#39;t supposed to love at times but maybe it had more to do with calm. Peace of Mind for the continuance of maintenance upon suppression but not in that ways that had been seen at times for the darker but rather the true white. There was an issue though after some historical interaction but also modern and future within my process followed a path of conversation that led to one of the most important understands within life for true. When if under duress in present does one still choose past and the answer is silently but loudly protecting oneself in present. There was a correct point in my mirror upon entrance to my home where the entrance is to the side of me on the right side. It told of what was needed in the moment grateful of relayance and that there was ways to have tells and information outside the Natural Original Setting State as to how to proceed to create quality of life and ways of life facilitation. It saved. Another tell of this was creating motivation for those in the Natural Original Setting State. Of could be considered in the Natural Original Setting State regarding the wording and potential literal in relayance from the spirit in which could be considered a Holy thing. Understanding that the Original Setting was within but also without was becoming understood. There is literal regarding at times regarding wordings. Sometimes there isn&#39;t. Safety. 100% Safe. Protectin was told to be first. Family Second. The others third. What if all three Originated from self. It was tell thought to protect self first in circumstances where harm confronted. Why you see within certain battle Warriors protecting themselves at times instead of their comrades and there was other styles which this less commonplace. It didn&#39;t mean that others were better but rather that they were different and approached same dreams in different styles. Protecting ill will and from regarding was of import. Sometimes of Speed as well. There was ultra Moral beings that operated in certain fashion that scared at times but didn&#39;t mean too. There was a tell as well of repentance, a certain kind of blue regarding. Might was at hand and I didn&#39;t know how to view certain aspects of the past especially given knowledge that there were bad things that had happened. Correct was leading the charge these days and White-Beige Triangle consigliere Guardians approach was similar to that in which they defended at times but not always based upon morality in how others responded. This was gaming related in an earlier discernment of prophet pocket change if only in a dream. IT was a whole god dang casket. The Clown aesthetic was not good enough at times and it was tell of importance upon Story but not the only thing. The metaphorical upon literal at times regarding some of the storylines pertaining to Pennywise and things had been artistry and supply respectively. They had more in common than they knew and Pennywise wasn&#39;t the only clown. Sometimes I write subjects in regards to certain paragraphs that don&#39;t always jive or are on the same line. That was a tell.<br><br>The experiences I am having have been surreal at times. There is a change taking place on this planet which involves more than what some think even think and it&#39;s this inside look at times regarding what some have labelled new Earth. The Psychic phenomenon of physicals delivering pizzas for free upon people to create awareness seems far fetched. <br><br>The Akashic Records reflected energy and information in many different ways in what I noted in interaction with spirit during a bit of situation spiritually having to do with music and love. I tried opening light and somehow I was trying to envision yellow love in which I classically view as red. It reminded of the past in a certain manner but also the present and future. I noted something during some of these experiences in which I feel did spur spiritual interaction. It made me wonder why interaction at times had been put fourth as the problem and I felt like things continue to get better with this shift. It&#39;s a conflict that exists within myself as to balance what is good and what is bad. The Canadian Red in how I interpreted some of the interaction even clean as blue with story notes of Anti-Camp decent and reminiscent of God as well as Saving the Devil. This was an aspect of a grouping of spiritual in the pursuit of Healing and other kinds in a Mission Statement that reflected Moral values. Of course in the middle all of this reminded of before this presence made itself more known in this process, a place that has been through a lot on Jacksons Point of it all but God working in mysterious ways would be more cover if not for the Events and discernment of God within my experience especially earlier on that Bus Ride. The McDonald&#39;s of the situation for remedy upon the reg joe for going to grab two big macs. We Thank you God for the experiences and moments as well as the Continuance that you wanted to Mention for this paragraph. Even just mentioning his name and thanking him in a published book as has been done many times by way of informational placement spiritually through physical writings can create an awareness that protects but also provides gratitude and appreciation as well as thanks. This too extended to other Gods on this Planet especially Allah. Story moments of cars passing by in fashions that remind of something fascinating and scary like God force maneuvering Physical in which the programmers laugh. It was the Origin Theory that was brought up after these maneuverings of cars happened in certain fashion. 2 Black and 1 Blue with another passing back of dark-blue reminding of a Sports Win that brought fourth reminiscence and communication upon such Origin theory after my over reaction in radical manner. The Paint on the Salvation Army walls reminding of realism blue even with memory of construction earlier on months previous to sooth the soul even if not the true. I felt realism save me and moments where spiritual awoken and arrived, reminding of the Modern Day Brits. It was like this let know of myself that I was more than what I seemed. That I was a soldier at times in this life and felt as such even still with Charlotte colours.
