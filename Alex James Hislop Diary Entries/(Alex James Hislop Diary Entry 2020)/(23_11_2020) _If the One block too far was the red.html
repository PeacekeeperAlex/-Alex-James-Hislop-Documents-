<div class="title">(23/11/2020) &quot;If the One block too far was the red flag on the play&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I had woken up and there was this discernible difference as there has been correlating with the past four or five days in the kinds of maneuvering of other  dimensional atmospherics around myself. There has been noting that this kind of phenomenon has been discerned to be taking place in many different manners as well as but there being a more prominent noting this past week. Tube like atmospherics the one day while discerning Other Dimensional Water outside of the tube areas. Before hand movement of certain atmospherics reflecting past process emphasis in what seemed to be clearing spiritual names and awareness. This day seemed to be more movement towards the style of organization and facilitation in regards to overlapping dimensional. The way they can set processes at times is shift dimensional size in varying degrees and manner, one day I might be a small in a certain areas experiencing atmospherics that the next day look tiny given the dimensional maneuvering and changing they are able to set. IE, I experience a dimensional area smalled within my hand area even without me knowing in which might not even reflect to be in my hand area and the next day me experiencing an area way larger not within my physical body radius. In understanding there can be other dimensional and spiritual that I am experiencing that is not fully reflected on my psychic registry has been a part of the learning but sometimes when one has experienced something in referencing experiencing understanding that it is not necessarily in reference to fully what one has experienced. Also the IE as an example gives a tell as well. What exactly has been in regards too? It&#39;s interesting that some of these variables would manifest when I bring up interaction systems and atmospherics that were created from the 2nd and 3rd Ages of Natural Time pertaining to the Natural Original Setting State in the potential that some of us prepared for single lives since then and living those single lives currently and that some those Interaction Systems and Atmospherics were specifically for those single lives being lived currently. When I would bring that up there was a twinkle of an eye. Maybe it&#39;s being brought up in such manners and fashions pertaining to communicational prowess as well as. Considering the kind of morality, positivity, familyship and enlightenment of those ages as we are currently experiencing the fourth age, I don&#39;t see why there should a problem in regards to talking about such ages, especially since there is also a large percentage of Good that has happened during the fourth age as well too. I surmise this to be the case and it does partially have to do with mentalism in reading the response from the spirit in the kind of logic pointing towards history in clarification. The kind of knowing that exists. It&#39;s not just an inner knowing that I feel to be true as well as a faith in the Good and that we are from Good but also Science in History as well as History in Science. It seemed to me that some were trying to claim that somehow I didn&#39;t need access to certain interaction systems for a portion, but I also feel that certain pipelines opened to allow for better interaction even with still discerning that some of the interaction for the spiritual around me was still with woes. It was an interesting contrast with the point I had made that it also had to do with societal normality of where I am from where I could still point towards things and identify even through psychic registry but more importantly in regards to what was being seen from those looking at it from Reality perspective obviously with safe lens up to a point, and say that it still had to do with baseline quality of life in which did not include getting attacked. That It is partly spiritual sanctioned from my Main Spriit Guides speaking cleaned up versions of these words as well as what my Main Spirit Guides relayed in regards to this sentence. What was their story for what they wanted me to ask?  <br><br>I had gone for a walk, symbolism as to the care for art and history as well as explanationals regarding why it was that recreational could viewed in multiple capacities but that regardless when certain kind, defense was a normality. There was a regardless for whether it&#39;s considered recreational or not. There was some arguing about in what capacity certain lives were being lived and for some of it less to do with the entire but rather certain portions. In my case, I am guessing it was actions that was garnering certain kinds of debates and arguments. I had wondered if I wasn&#39;t alone in regards to this. There seemed to be a connecting correlation in other physicals experiencing certain systems, mostly good in what I perceived and correlated from my own experience or at least what I surmised. My Surmision, Guesswork and Faith defended by Logic in ways of having to do with what I was saying being a certain kind of correct. I know there are logical types that feel to prove it by way of science matters greatly but also the proving of such science mattered greatly too. For you see, it was the previous proving from science in other-dimension and spiritual to the physical that had already proven parts of what I had been saying. The interaction vagabonds begone. Can you imagine a certain spiritual area that you had to share, a science type sets it up beautifully, then these knaves show up and set a small bubble of interaction within, espousing false history within that area. It is a tragic actually, a tragic of civility. Except now imagine that this supposed small area was actually the size of space? Imagine it might actually be thousands of times larger. <br><br>That the small microscopics that had been identified at times on this planet, did hold life and spiritual life similar to our own? That the higher selves of blood cells were dancing in the spirit realm. How much more peculiar would it be for their to be life within the earth? What was the size comparison to Earth to Space compared to one blood cell to a human?<br><br>Tried watching a movie the day before but there really was a feeling where I felt zoned out but doesn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t care. I know that family was around me and that I was protected, I had hoped for similar in regards to other dimensional. <br><br>Recreational and work discussions, trying to relay the nuance of how some are viewing certain labellments and putting rigid guidelines regarding, some takes the day off, says I am going to do some recreational activities, spiritually certain kind saying the entries day only has to do with recreational and then another kind interjecting trying to say that it was only a certain portions where the person actually went with what his guideship indicated hitting the marker exactly what he went with but claiming of simplistic in front of the scenes impeding upon what he chose supposedly when higher courts actually spoke true and vindicated that person and certain interaction getting in the way and ignoring what had been chosen and said. The power of placement of dimensional upon someone really does matter. If ones experiences for a portion reflect hurt or harm from certain dimensional areas in overlap, still matters if they experienced something they didn&#39;t want to experience. Understanding there is myriads of good dimensional around oneself important as well but does that nullify if there is bad taking place in interaction and experience in other areas? No. It helps though. A big one though in regards to this kind of discussion especially for the former part of this paragraph really had to do with platform and whether one was speaking politically or not. It wasn&#39;t just about politics though.<br><br>Felt like certain kind were trying to aim my words in certain fashion in which might have been bad but i discerned it to be good. I am hoping it was good. Why would I care about whether its good or not? Is that a needed question? It shouldn&#39;t have to be. Guidance from certain voices around me in explanational a part of some sort of story as to why it is that the good are doing what they do but also other kinds of interactions, maybe it has more to do with guiding and guidance than what some though, maybe it had to do with the kind of life path discussions that is from my kinds of spirituality, maybe it does have to do with other s in certain kinds of interactions maneuvering and helping processes not only next door but also in moments of need.  Discussions were also talking about importance of Life and Non-Life days before potentially more expanded this day as well.
