<div class="title">(01/09/2020) &quot;Hope Hand Strong&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Quote:<br><br>Activity:<br>Story exists in many different forms. This day even with some of the talking points with the spirit in full conversation about defense works I would see a certain story line variable in certain other dimensional areas in which really truly laments upon the idea and fact that there is multiple storylines traversing some of our content on this physical earth. <br><br>- (Early morning energy changes upon some of the conversation happening on my end. There have been moments where I had been discussing how I have felt in regards to certain aspects of the Original Creator that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. It had been on my mind since the day before yesterday especially in regards to some of the insinuations of attack in regards to myself and it&#39;s not just in regards to myself to be true. I am upset at times. Today I had realized that some of the Alex James Hislop Diary Entry content, about 40 - 80 video from 2018 to may of 2019 were somewhat misplaced. I had originally thought it to be on some of the hard drives within my computer or on the externals I had. Especially one moment early on where I had remembered transferring certain video on to the external and even placed it on my table with thoughts similar to that of which spoke that the transferring was successful but upon looking for those videos I have not been able to locate them and while a large portion of them are online already on my you tube channel it&#39;s still a good thing to have a backup copy in which I might remedy one of these days by downloading some of the videos from online to have a backup copy plus there was the audio portion as well in which was already separate which made certain kinds of projects in the future easier. Either way I vented because I have an upsetness in regards to the Original Creator that my Main Spriit Guides indicated for no saving us in the moments that we needed for those weren&#39;t saved. I understand he has the power to do even if that means traversing past certain lines. Don&#39;t get it mistaken that the Original Creator that my Main Spriit Guides indicated doesn&#39;t have the power to do so because he does. I got angry and upset and made a comment in my mind in which I then saw a certain kind of spirit traverse into my peripherals while being shoehorned high up above in which I discerned the potential of certain lower down spirit getting attacked potentially in regards to the history and knowledge as to why at times I am being put fourth up above in certain moments. Another reason was power utilization from certain banners as well. It segwayed to a conversation about the fact that the Original Creator that my Main Spirit Guides indicated can save in the moments that my Main Spirit Guides indicated as to the answer to the fact that we need to be working together and teamwork in regards to why some are not traversing and saving as to the falling of where that line of attack goes. It moved to that interaction areas eventually that reminds of 2016. Said to have been a dimensional existence and upon the dimensional overlaps discussion might have had to do something with it. Watched Battlefield Earth (2000) before going to be din which there has been this thing with that content in which I hadn&#39;t been able to identify personally.)<br>- ( I decided to take the day off yesterday partially because I wanted too but also because I have been tired with dealing in regards to the energy hits which I know is no comparison to what some of the spirit have to do with the energy hits. First part of the day there was some argumentatives invoked, some defense works spoken about mainly in the manner of defense points brought up which really seemed to hit home. It was interesting because even the day before I kind of felt the some of the bad spirit get slammed but I think there was a switching up and resources relayed. I had also done some advocationals and left some information up on my computer throughout the day and night that hopefully helped in a certain manner. A focus had been in regards to spiritual information behind the scenes protecting us anyhow in a certain manner. There had been some trying to switch over to that kind of thing where you live your life and updates pop up in regards to some of the attack where it&#39;s just normal and accepted in a casual way or at least that seems to be interlaced in regards to some systems where I even said I don&#39;t find it acceptable. Also that kind of thing lamented upon as well where supposedly some of our other dimensional selves are experiencing pain and suffering to be the normal thing when myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated do not feel that to be the normal thing and shouldn&#39;t be considered as such. The day before I did fee la group having to do with God spark amalgamation and traversing from up above to save those below to have gotten hit as well which I felt some of the pints related yesterday was a hit home pertaining as to why we should receive resources, defense and quality of life from up above. There were things revealed even in higher light and I partially prompted some of it to be revealed on my end but I kind of feel that some of it was already being revealed either. Discussions of facilitation of events and utilization of event within life in front of the scenes played out in higher areas and even lower areas first was discussed. One thing that was emphasized is that it still matters and the kind of story happenings and seen in certain dimensional places can still matter and have an impact as well as facilitated in ways in which lends towards it mattering. There had been discussions of whether to heighten earth-based fame and others kinds,  with certain spirit even talking about that were all famous variable in a utilization as to say why so much defense has been here to a certain degree in making it matter in certain places. I thought of though the idea and creed that we all do matter and that being enough for certain defense groups still with compensation in which shows that it matters. Another speaking point had been about moving upwards certain spirit in certain moments, like I have felt psychic stimuli which tells me of moving upwards upon certain attacks taking place at lower levels and especially in how I view things was another topic brought up in that it&#39;s not unnormal in how I have viewed certain things not only within my culture but also within other kinds of culture as well too, for example how I do not find it ok to have certain other-dimensional selves and allpersonal getting attacked in manners pertaining to former areas I was just at to be acceptable just because someone needs me to be attacked. Again in how I view the perimeters in regards to what I find it acceptable pertaining to experience facilitation pertaining to what I am experiencing as well as life utilization pertaining to content facilitation. <br>-( I felt like the house was attacked at times this day. beforehand there was defense points spoken about in which would eventually culminate supposedly in a certain kind of realignment of point systems for some of it to claim that the points from myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides didn&#39;t hit home to claim that there should be certain attack but for some of us we had been only utilizing certain points systems that my Main Spirit Guides the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br><br><br><br>Content Experience Log:<br>13 reasons Why<br>The 13th Warrior (1999)<br>Outlander (2008)<br>Kingdom Come: Deliverance<br>Trollslayer<br><br>Energy Log: <br>Worked on Hope Energies.<br>Worked on therapeutic Energies.<br>Work on loving energies. <br><br>Medical Observation:<br>There was this large explosion of energies in which looked to be on a certain path I was heading towards and if I didn&#39;t receive the healing that was needed I am wondering if it would have hurt me physically, like a rupture in head area. It also looked like another kind of path I was on find of felt like a sinking ship in other dimensional in which I am unsure if I was whisked away or if they corrected course on that portion of life path. The energy explosion looked dire and seemed to be an explosion of rushing energies towards the explosion point or maybe another point near it. It was like it exploded in front of me and might have been related to time. like I had sense a future event before I felt it in other dimensional pertaining to certain kinds of anatomy. There might also be a utilization in regards to this dimensional pertaining to time in certain manners.
