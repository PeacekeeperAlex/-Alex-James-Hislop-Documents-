<div class="title">(12/26/2020) &quot;Energy that we are from&quot; </div>
<div class="content"> Activity:<br><br>I have noted different experiences as a psychic medium having to do with interactions being set a certain way sometime to say and protect but sometimes not for good reasons enough. <br><br>What had been revealed today at times had been revealed in the past in numerous occasions not only within certain dimensional areas that don&#39;t usual reveal that informational but also in those that do I which had to do with the fact that i was innocent. That certain kind were setting nteractional upon me to try and change the ton to the conversation that that wasn&#39;t the case and that they were also trying to create me to be the bad guy as well with certain actions. I could look toward the good and know that a portion had safeguarded in the kind of thing where you sometimes see a movement into the past backwards of emergence of energy done so for many reasonings. English emerged on physical planet earth but then is safeguarded by way of emergence in certain time frames listed by true good. There was something similar in regards to names and forms as well as life. It was always one of those things I could look towards my kind of good and know they safeguarded this life prominantyl even when some would try to claim they did something first and a regardless in the mix either way if that was the case but something tells me that higher up lights more in line with true good would safeguard if need be.<br><br>Early morning yesterday let knows of in yeah there warfare thing happening in a certain manner.the let know of safeguarding innocent and other kinds similar seemed to be the most important. Doesn&#39;t the good side prominately with those that protect innocent if the war is about that? If the war happened to be about that then that would put a marker upon those claiming to be good yet maneuvering in bad ways regarding such a war. There was this moment of me sitting up in my bed and a certain group not caring about certain kind claiming to be good in this process and I cared less for the kind perception built even while trying to claim and prove they are good alongside their own actions for the kinds of things done in the name of compromising. I didn&#39;t believe them to certain degrees needed. It either way I didn&#39;t feel that they had a stake in my life process to the degrees that they claimed. There were many that we&#39;re good regarding but it kind of felt like some trying to still squabble over process power in the last-ditch effort into be towed aside. Many good regarding trying to defend and many good times was truth but there was still something there that I didn&#39;t buy. I hope the informational of truth regarding makes it truth in other dimensional placement so no worries regarding what written physically. I had asked if morality had seen what kind of tracks had been laid in the past regarding Earth-Based and what was done about it. Why did some have to group together with so called vagabonds was another question. Why was their stage setting happening and some claiming that the dirty was done during warfare for given how important perception can be and how not at fault certain perceptional dimensional are regarding I find it did dispairing to think that somehow what&#39;s to!d in regards to certain attack on love to be really a warfare thing when the cat and mouse of look away during peace had garnered other kinds of looks. There had been freedbies that exist from morality regardless of whether promote or not with larger portion regardless of prompted or not. That kind of look that said that we can take solace that morality the concept and non-concept was partially defending innocent in regards to battle and warfare.<br><br>Rights issues discerned at times for psychcs as well as those that had discerned certain kind of conflict in the spirit and maneuvered to defend themselves and an overlap exists for the two. How the heck could somebody be labelled as something in him not being good for societal when it was that ill sectioning off in which was also partially poisoning societal. <br><br>I am asking for help from those that my Main Spirit Guides specified in regards to this sentence in regards to the Matters that my Main Spirit Guides relayed regarding the communications they communicated in regards to this section of this sentence. I had noted that I would be scared if my parents passed on physically but given what I had discerned as a psychic medium that they might want to pass on gracefully in a certain manner. I had thought about how I would have to support myself. I had wondered about other spiritual that were worried about something similar in their own way in regards to variables in regards to their own lives. A certain kind of reliance for a portion that really deserved attention. Where were the programs needed to be able to support peoples and spiritual if that reliance impacted. There was another variable I had discerned about me being afraid of my parents passing in which had less to do with monetary support in which in this sense had to do with direction and at times how lost I had felt at times in those moments I did traverse to the city alone. Simple thing like going to the doctor or reissuing a health or even the act of paying bills. Some of this did have to do with not wanting to stand upon two feet as some would point out but it also had to do with living life variable impacted to degrees in which one disliked. Small potatoes is what some might say but it wasn&#39;t to me. Some didn&#39;t want to go work and some wouldn&#39;t go to work in which would fin peoples and spiritual on the side of the road busking for change when they should be able to play video games all day freely. What are the programs facilitated by the rich in which allowed spiritual and people to be able to live their lives without getting a job under true baseline quality of life? What are the better questions to ask in regards to this paragraph? <br><br>There was a compassionate quality that I had in which did extend to small things supposedly. Like throwing out an item that i had had for a while regardless of useful or not. Feeling compassion in regards to someone lost. A sadness in regards to certain circumstances seen. <br><br>In the past an emphasization in regards to developing transportation that can transcend the current times. <br><br>Spirituality<br>Meditation music<br>Mediation<br>Love<br>Writing<br>Lightworking</div>
