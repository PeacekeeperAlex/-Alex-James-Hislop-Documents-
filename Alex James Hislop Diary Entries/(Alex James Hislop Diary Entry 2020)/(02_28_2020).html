<div class="title">(02/28/2020)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>two scenes, one in my room and one in the office, one having to do with feeling that stimuli on the verge of a fight and not holding back in regards to that stimuli while also utilizing that stimuli in the past as venting but not trying to get spirit harmed albeit in this instance i could feel the stimuli more than usual and when I was venting I could feel certain kind of spirit get harmed in my arms and hands areas where you usually classically feel that on the verge of a fight energy. I could discern that they were trying to get me to utilize story to try and use metaphoricals in affecting outcome of certain conflict behind the scenes. I have said this over the past three years that my Promptings only pertain to what my Main Spriit Guides indicated. I lost control a bit and I certain didn&#39;t mean to harm the spiritual that my Main Spriit Guides indicated behind the scenes although I am looking to defend myself in the ways that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. Then in the office room,  I then got angry at leaders in which was at least at first thought of to be certain kind of direction that bad spirit wanted me to go and to be true I probably shouldn&#39;t have gone that way. I pointed towards leaders and got angry and Lost control again although this time a certain kind of spirit was there holding me back i could feel my energies being held back. It was losing control but right after I pointed that the lack of leadership is leading towards a lack of control in certain actions in placing myself and others in areas amongst spiritual in which is going to try to get us to lose control through manipulation and influencing as well as other kinds in which if so said to be the reasoning for some of the harm and attack behind the scenes then it might be the lack of leadership in which is to blame for it&#39;s own demise at times. Considering myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides have continued to let know that we want to be placed where our Main Spirit Guides indicated, I think it needs to be taken seriously. Either way leaders were protected and I was put within a Vent system before losing control in my room. It hasn&#39;t happened often these days, not in that sort of manner anyhow. It felt like certain kind were losing their shit when I went to Newmarket and went over these points in a defensive fashion while walking through the City. There was also a certain kind there under duress so said. There was multiple good things in play on this on my end behind the scenes and I am not lying. It wasn&#39;t just in regards to me as well. In fact it&#39;s probably been the week and/or month in regards to certain things especially if certain kind is attacking sporadically not on this day in regards to this day. Earlier this morning I prompted my defense upon trying to go to bed in a certain fashion that my Main Spirit Guides have relayed. I was still going with what my Main Spriit Guides indicated but there was an emphasis in regards to below the thresholds. My Actions, Non-Actions, etc.(defined by my Main Spriit Guides) only pertain to what my Main Spriit Guides indicated for the reasonings obvious and relayed in the ways that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. <br><br>- Early morning looked like certain kind were cornered and there was a moment where I looked to my right, I could sense the presence of two forces fighting and then a third intervening then channel spirit claiming that was my move but to be true I am not certain and I had this strong sense of what at times has been the case of certain kind tilizing this life and manueivering through me. Spiritual claiming to be me at times and certain kind trying to maneuver<br><br>Trying to say somehow that what has been on regards to the AJH Radio Free Earth Broadcasts has been my doing, a let know that there has been a certain conflict management style in regards and battle tethered in which has been discerned at times as a battle for earth whether it be on my end or not. Some trying nullify and harm a marker and understood point that I go with what my Main Spirit Guides in the Light and by extension what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. A certain kind trying to let know there has been actions below certain thresholds that I need to stand by and me continuing to let know that I go with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in which is partially in part by way of the kind of groups that are trying to say that I endorse actions that I did not, it&#39;s not just those groups in which I would look at and want to endorse there actions and for some of them did endorse a portion of their actions that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the capacity that my Main Spirit Guides relayed but there is also groups in which I want nothing to do with in the mix trying to harm me and the knowledge and understanding that I went with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated throughout this life needs to continue to be understood. Certain spiritual that are not me and continuing to try and claim to be me I find not acceptable considering the amount of damage that has been done. Either way this day there is an emphasis with going with certain below the scenes actions in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. An interesting variable that it had to do with some not being able to handle an upsetting comment from myself in which was only in reference to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated and not in regards to some that are thinking it has to do with them. It doesn&#39;t. Right after I called out the aspect of the Original that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, there was a warning impressions which spooked me and a variation of such within that window of about 30 seconds between when I made the comments that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and when I promoted what my Main Spirit Guides indicated, I said if there was time to deploy in regards to this life in regards to the prompting, prompting what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I went to my Family and then Earth-Based as if in question as to whether they wanted to be a part of such and prompted in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated of them. I felt deployment and spiritual emergence. Energies I could sense of spiritual and the knowledge that today there might be some forces around myself. There had been a tell about this kind of thing about prompting below thresholds and emphasis pertaining to that kind of thing where there is a lack of communications and wherewithal from higher thresholds and lower thresholds in which has caused an interplay to exist where some prompt a certain defensive style below the thresholds in certain Time frames but the interesting of it is that some have been wanting to disrupt a communication, knowledge, proof and happening upon the link, perception and knowing as well as feeling that higher light is around and that they are protecting us especially upon the experiences I have had in stimuli, communication and psychictivity but there seems to be a misunderstanding pertaining to such connection and a methodology from going to A to B in regards to certain spiritual defense from higher up to those below at least in regards to a certain kind of viewpoint and truth because you can see at times down here certain moments where some are left empty handed and not given support needed when all the resources available in higher places exist. While I continue to hold down and know as well as interaction with higher light while being incarnate and in front of the scenes there are still those in interaction with me that wonder why it is that higher haven&#39;t done more and then there are those that wonder why they haven&#39;t done more in regards to making some believe in them. There was something happening this past week and every time I chirped out certain kinds for not defending us enough at times there was let know and proof there were those defending while I had been making an issue potentially making a fool of myself. Another moment arrived wile on the road at Metro in a spot where I sometimes go to in a spiritual scrum sort of way here and there in which other dimensional might use more so. There was a let know about something in regards to my family and others as to whether they are protected and it happen to coincide with a certain chirping out that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in which I surmised that there was a certain kind of protection garnered in understanding that that is the truth and story metaphorical defensive if need be.<br><br>Sensed those security impression sometimes felt at airports some trying to say they are bad and not the good guys. Certain kind pulling maneuvers while I was in Newmarket in which seemed to be a note of corruption albeit it might have actually been the good pissing off the bad that are pretending to be good, maybe it was both. <br><br>Themes: #Deployment #MediationPoints #DiscussionPoints #DefensivePoints #History #Rememberance #Knowledge #Events <br><br></div>
