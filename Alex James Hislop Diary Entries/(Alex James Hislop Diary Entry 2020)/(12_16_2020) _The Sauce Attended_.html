<div class="title">(12/16/2020) &quot;The Sauce Attended&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>A note of the devil early morning after peaceful and calming interactions. Some trying to say why it was that they were using in front in certain manners. They would look make certain kind look to be the bad guy, I know my case physically on this planet, there was an awareness in which certain argumentative had upsetness sometimes leading to shitty comments as to the excuse for me being the bad guy but also utilization to clear name and to try and keep me at some sort of level while being utilized as some sort of tank. There had been a clouth of saving when going into certain zones and for a certain culture a desensitization in regards to what happens in regards to what happens to behind the scenes given the kind of conflict at times at level. There was talk of metaphor in regards to blood. Certain kind mixing blood behind the scenes spiritually. Dry mouth in the morning and certain kind of taste of blood in cigarettes, in food, weed smoking and breathing, it was everywhere times and the metaphorical was said to be the life of immorality in which also connection with immortality in vampires and blood. Some had been said to have been trying to trap certain kind by way of enticing and entrapping but some of it had to do with certain kind trying to survive in regards to doing defense work. Updates were commencing. For you see at times it wasn&#39;t it just vampire auschwitz. It was also a concentration camp of those that needed defense work to survive. The tell in the mix though is that in certain good areas around me had more force than usual in such for portions was partly permanent. A lot of good traversing around me and a lot changes taken place along with mebeingplacedin better dimensional interaction as had been seen on the yesterday, there was also a situating taking place. Even though I continued to say that I was done and tired as well as not working on this life as much, w<br>I still knew I was going to work but what needed to be understood is that I didn&#39;t want to work for this any longer was a part of how I was proceeding. If it was from this life as to some of the things that had happened to me spiritually let alone others said to be because of this life, I asked myself how the hell did I deserve to have to work on this life. Some misunderstood what I talked about daily partially having to do with defending myself but also rights issues that had less to do with it.<br><br>There is an area outside certain attack and immorality, as well as other kinds, even if the original creator was to save all if not most, it wouldn&#39;t be affected in certain manners with good going bad. This area with the correct parameters that my Main Spirit Guides indicated should be given a name and already has many names in which I decided to call the cross H.<br><br>The devil wasn&#39;t as bad as what some said, not for the real devil of Earth-Based anyhow when taking into Account the manipulation and influencing as well as the way the map looked at times. There was another reminding of purple and pink as well as Magenta in which also spoke of cyclops that was good, was known to be good, some sort of guide, visited hell at times but also other places too.<br><br>I woke up and there was a snafu in interaction for what discerned and felt as a psychic medium. It had to do with certain kind for some of them that dont listen to guideship informations either because of ways of life or a compromise worth saving. I had seen guideship fail at times down here but really it something else, funny enough at times the compromise was that in which was failing some of us down here but tolerating non-defense as well as those compromises that seemed beneficial regarding certain direcion and lack there of might have seemed to be the better option. I felt harm as a psychic medium understand the kind I am speaking of, observing harm upon infrastructure in which feels like that in which I am booked up to for a portionnis experiencing attack whether it be low pain stimuli or not as I can&#39;t fully at times but its also noting other spiritual under duress and maneuverings that speak of conflict. Do note I have noted a large presence of good continuance in this process and many times felt defense regarding. I felt attack commence though and it did seem like some trying to hijack certain interaction areas. I had prompted the most strongest I could prompt as Alex James Hislop in regards to my life to situate guideship suppression as well as have it be understood my direction. It was certain kind doing action attachment and blame management in which was not only harming me but also others and the interaction still reflecting anger I plantation and a lack direction even when there is large amounts of good within vicinity I had had had enough of. It wasn&#39;t just me prompting that but also others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. As the storyline goes upon awareness that upon my Main Spirit Guides direction in regards to me  even as already understood as it was, got through to certain areas, prominately were able to direct that strongest prompt and especially given my Main Spirit Guides information being seen daily and understood as well as translation and the other kinds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated getting through and situating days previous, it seemed the logical move especially given in helping what I am choosing and maneuvering as well what others are choosing and doing. I ask how these events correspond with events taking place in the world and space as well as the other communities. Days previous what does it look like? Weeks previous? Months previous? And if there isn&#39;t a problem then that solves that either way regardless. The Love storyline that followed up afterwards yesterday early morning intense in which I called upon moral advanced to save. There was also a great many other good in action.<br><br>Interesting that I would note a potential phenomenon having to do with either sleep walk and sleep actions in literal physical actions in sleep walking or movement of certain aspects of life track as well as potentially the dark horse having to do with altering of actions in the past which reflects upon my life track as if I had done those actions, in this instance and instances where scratchs of pencil on my dresser in which I not remember doing as well as a tablet video game in which the choices in the game itself different. Do note that some try to claim that some of my actions I did do not to have actually been me when it was as this phenomenon is few and far in between for true. Writing The Natural Original Setting State innpencil on my door only to have it be not there in the morning as if I hadn&#39;t written at all. Interestingly enough where I would punch a while in the door due to turbulence taking place behind the scenes in the kinds of action taking place. These phenomenon are not as bad as they seem and given the intelligence to be conversation with myself and certain spiritual regarding out loud voice channeling indicate a lot of good life path dictation in a certain manner, even if gaming and writing can be considered to be personal, it&#39;s a please don&#39;t do it again if need be. Much good created but the alter of life path matter greatly.<br><br>I had intellectual discussions and realized the kind of conversation as well as intellectual pursuit. The natural original setting state as well as the original creator origin theories of both. The spiritual maneuvering and facilitating upon even one single word is fascinating, imagine one word invoking entire dimensional overlap placements in facilitation of debate and conversation as well as other kinds including other forms of communication styles and interactions sometimes different than what I know as a physical human.<br><br><br>Themes:<br>#InteractionFacilitation #ConflictAlternatives #EntertainmentForUs #ColdShoulderFireworks #Devil #HisCrossH # TimingMysteriouOrMiraculous #Soothsaying #CyberPunk #Gaming #EarthBased #DreamsOfGetTogethers #SupposedlyAttended #Sewer #Warthog #ManeuveringDreamPerspectives #ChangeOfProcessInteraction #TruthBeTold #WhiteAndBrown #OlympianGods #EgyptianGods #EarthGods #NotWantingToWorkReallyAboutSafety #NeverSupposeToHappen #NotWantingToLive #TruthWithGoodReasons #AlexJamesHislop #AndOthersWithGoodReasonsToo #ApreciationRespectCareHopeAndNotYourFault</div>
