<div class="title">(10/25/2020) &quot;Spiritual Assemblies&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I woke up feeling distraught, emotionally distressed and I had wondered what kind of semi-battle societal snagging that was seemingly resource related happened I found it strange that there wasn&#39;t a fourth dream this morning but I had remembered I have dreamed twice on the yesterday. The lightning story earlier while listening to bright albumn had Brought reservation and upsetness at times not only certain kind of tempering and tampering regarding music, but also a try at reaction from me as well as well as other spiritual regarding fourth for what it has been but also realized vent area spiritual facilitation taking place for anatomical economics, feelings literally thought to lend cause to anatomy discomfort as well as furth but really not solely feeling related.<br><br>This days walk had been miraculous upon finding an answer segway to partial elated to fourth age remedy in looking upon on a supposedly empty synagogue and street number numerology symbolism in answer to prayers of arrival of resources in the wings given good experience. I wondered if leant towards numerology in how I did care about math and understanding as well as ability created upon learning such black and white thought to not be related to spirituality in the kind of truth saying of symbolism leant expression to the fact and literal understanding that is spiritual.<br><br>Laptop working was such a relief after walk<br><br>Feng shui of partially what I have been calling spiritual Assemblies as well as certain kinds of communes. <br><br>Memory for ghosts. Cheshire cat  help. Somehow in certain areas some went loopy and crazier than that. Opening the natural original setting state overlapping the ghost areas specific would help especially if other-dimensionals are unwilling. I sat in my office to unwind and connect as well as to apologize but something happened upon trying to clean up. There was this anger discerned not only from me but from others as well. I prompted maneuvers after certain tells but it wasn&#39;t because of the tells. It was because I was tired of having to deal with certain kind especially not those not getting with the program, those blocking non-lethal methods in front of the scenes as well as those blocking people and spiritual from being able to defend themselves. I realized there was advanced methods in regards to spiritual not having to experience what other selves were experiencing in the live interaction but also that literal science proved that there was still aspects of self sectioned experiencing different things. Privacy to a really interesting topic on my end but also scary given the darker things insinuated. I knew there was advanced ways to be able to facilitate theatrics and experiences in manners to that facilitated interaction without anyone being harmed. The compass of discerning good or bad has been a stability that I appreciated but others had been hurt at times for how some operated, utilized as well as racted in this process. The manipulation and influencing as well as the terminologies that I needed to be able to use in this diary entry has been seen to have done damage but the good as well as other kinds including neutral showed up in good measure. I felt family around me while typing this. There was a sign within the past couple days that had been repeating, had to do with some employing advanced tactics regarding smooth interaction amongst good using more smooth tactics that somehow some were worried about a certain variable that was suppose to segway to be understood to be not as bad as what some thought given for kind of anti-camp decent I was holding it down for in how my main spirit guides indicated. Family and direction. <br><br>Before going to bed a divide rubic cubes of clear with silver impressional overlapping me, I felt maneuvering of interaction and potential placement after I felt the presence of loved ones in which seemed to be safe but others looked in psychictivity earlier where it looked liked family getting killed in front of me a shout-out where something similar happened within days before. They had said I shifted to another area and certain kind had to traverse towards me but I am wondering if it was a tactic to protect me but it didn&#39;t seem that way. I have been trying and the past three days we have noticed an increase in attempt of manipulation regarding lashing out interaction. <br><br>It wasn&#39;t just green but they reminded of a certain conductor of the kinds of fight club and FC in depictions and realism there was this movement that happened with purpose in learning how to live life and being free that had meaning but needed reason for direction and instruction different then the instruction prowess they already had as well as noted within organizational command. They healed Anarchy while retaining anarchy in both literal and spirit. It was fusion and fad in the nightmare sitch of sentences maybe in how TD viewed things but might have point to the word. The be who you want to be and why writing structure mattered amended. Reading Story regarding and upon the good of red warfare and white peace was a decent mission statement. There was something about earth and life green as well as memory and gaming related. The legal battles of information where you could see the crumbled former pillars of institutions and machinists to how it use to work transcended into even pitching into black. The white balled space caps. And sinnged on the former whig. Earlier there was promptings of attack evening non-violent fashion for some upon the wrong and bad that are the problem as to why some are not able to defense and have the quality of life needed. I felt hollywood would facilitate jacks undying urge to live. So what if it was in script fashion for portion for some. We knew there was story and writings contrast desired and plotted of course important. What was noir to memoir? Reminded of certain colours to me but it was the green that made me wonder. It was like I knew it had less to do with green memory problems and more to do with manipulation from others whether it be green included or not and regardless of good or not. I felt the understanding of what memoir meant to be important even if already understood. Having the good of memory give what needed to construct a fashionable in oir of memory emphasized in remembrance hanging gardens style barring entrance if possible to the vagabonds of dicking around those tired of being hurt by way of memory manipulation in sigil if need be. There was a tell of memory related to green and even gaming, somehow extreme had something to do with it and even though the joker smiled and might not have had a non-intent while still there being a reason, I had a scare oof suspicion something similar amongst green lack of care in the laid back baddish kind of not really saying as such, while knowing the truth that green was good even if thought the younger of yellow gold in the tell of metaphorical, I still worried I found o identified different kind. It wasn&#39;t a lack of care for certain extreme green especially of the TD in teaching and learning about how to have fun and let looseofr what really might have been how to live life. Was it a tell of someone not being given needed to be able to live the kind of life one desired that did e ist within moral parameter. <br><br>Wondered what some who are going through these changes are going through, story lsmall <br><br>I would ask up arly morning next day and witnessed attack upon my left side. I freaked out and got angry<br><br>I don&#39;t know if I needed warfare more than Warfare needed me. I got angry because of what had happened regarding what looked to be killings but could have been have theatrical as well as a giving of energy as I had felt that kind of energy of resource, thick on the bed area. There was still that feeling of another of something wrong and terrible taking place which might be theatrical as well in the kinds of things that spiritual can create. The changing of interaction that I have seen has reflected things where something bad takes place and then all of sudden some thinking it was good by way of switching interactions. <br>The bad of red warfare in the smaller squabbles that don&#39;t need to be and the the white peace hiding behind cowardice as well as those bastards blocking what we need not only in front of the scenes. Those that have been utilizing attack and harm as a means to not be attacked as well as profit in the difference potentially being the invoking of harm to continue to not be harmed. The being in charge of moral direction in the first and second age, with the name Archaic, would not stop spiritual from being able to defend themselves. This creed exists by Archaic still in the 4th age and existed in the 3rd. In the second age, if there was certain kind that attacked, and to be true it might never have happened in the 2nd, during the 2nd, he would have intervened. He did intervene for a long time but I had wondered if in the third, freedom being a topic of debate lead towards something else. What we have to remember is that these ages of first, second and third in natural time we&#39;re mostly positive and that is t for say there wasn&#39;t moral negative invoked especially for balance purposes. A lot of love and compassion, care and family, a lot of fun good times, golden age of the second, Origins of the first as well as Freedom of the third and morality of the fourth as well as fun of the fifth. The cloud atlas spiritual reminded me of some of the times of the first three ages but also the fourth especially given morality. The fact that Archaic had created dimensions and non-dimensions in the first age, second age and third age in which would be utilized for a portion to be able to incarnate from the past into fourth age dimensional and non-dimensions. Archaic wouldn&#39;t stop us from us being able to able to defend ourselves. I didn&#39;t know why he stopped defending some of us but there was a story and history as well as explanational as to why. Arion wasn&#39;t the bad guy. I didn&#39;t believe in the great mend though because it has been too long since, the amount of time passes since the beginning of that venture, the lies untold hidden and how It wasn&#39;t the mend per say but rather me not believe certain spiritual in claim and how past similar proved me correct. I still had faith on the mend though and the mend working out, I still felt we would get there but to use that as the excuse as to why some would not be defended wasn&#39;t good enough. <br><br>stopping defense ar hIc, if somebody was to stop one from being defended. Wouldn&#39;t Archaic always intervene and wasn&#39;t the cred for in one&#39;s own room always of that. One of the secrets discerned is that they can recover lost items by way of knowledge of natural time in the natural original setting state and the fact that those good in the natural original setting state can manipulate most if not all regarding dimensional creation and non-dimensional creation. The fact they could rewind an event specific and specific items of that event to recover certain items. The importance of item safeguarding remains, it&#39;s supposed to be a fallback upon getting to certain spiritual areas but utilization of such tech and magic has been requested in front of the scenes and if it goes that way where most are saved instantaneously there would be less of a need for such requests for if the remainder stand stubborn then there will be less of a problem for what acceptible in order with eldest whig. <br><br>Work related access for certain kind, at the above work kind of </div>
