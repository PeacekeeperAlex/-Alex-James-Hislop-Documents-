<div class="title">(23/07/2020)</div>
<div class="content">Dreams: It was like some one was trying to tell me at the end of each scene for two that I could see in some of the physical frames had to do with a tell that every time something happened one of the gangsters by the end of the scene would be dead. Something about colour. Red, Protect black if possible.<br><br>I felt that my Uncle was around for my father. There had been moments of my other Uncle as well as it reminded of like certain Christmas movies.<br><br>Buddy cop and even some of the back and fourth regarding that kind of interaction. Cops in the Dreams. Let knows of reputational defense.<br><br>Certain groups trying to help the bad guys yesterday in good manner for some groups. Character and Aesthetic utilization matters regarding, I have noted certain spiritual that still tries to extend an arm to the bad spiritual. There was groups trying to help and some trying to utilize certain form but there was something about it and I still would be careful. <br><br>Cinematic Spotlight for those on Earth that my Main Spirit Guides relayed regarding this communication. Cinematic Spotlight for those that my Main Spirit Guides relayed regarding this writing.<br><br>More support and awareness regarding the works that my Main Spirit Guides listed for this writing. My advocations and informational placement in what it is affecting for spiritual informational placement as well as support and resources regarding those that are being left with less because of my informational placement.<br><br>Teaching through my process, sometimes playing certain storylines there is grading regarding in hope of transfers, leeway and access, the good ones.<br><br>Healing those that pursue intimacy to save and situate, especially those without a luster for life seemingly creating reasons to want to live and to want to have a quality of life, dinner, movie, the other kinds of intimacy besides sex and kinds like sex. Shopping in a mall. <br><br>Relationships for what is truly the problem in sustaining and maintaining especially in regards to business and personal. Especially for that in which there is less of a problem being made into one.<br><br>Project Outline:<br>Work programs and Work outfits especially ones specialized in leases to other processes for short periods of time, days physical time but other kinds of normality timeframes similar in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Facilitation of Spiritual and other dimensional Work and recreational programs that can traverse with mobility. Overseers and safety regarding should be protected. Good Deployments if possible. This idea though especially for those of Charity and Pro-Bono but also those in that field of healing and repair regarding impact of processes on one another. I walk past a person on the street and their day got worse, maneuvering of systems and spiritual to that process, heal and move on. There those that end up staying and there are those do longer lengths of time. Retrieval and Transportation w. Stationary areas to be able to live a personal life through such rig. Water Work Rigs. What are the kind of setup spiritual w. recreational garb within every day societal away from water that would work. Retrofitters. What are the other kinds of physical industries that are good consult? Work facilitation? Life path direction? 911. I think of some of the quickest response times and 911 seems to be one of the quickest on this planet physically. I am thinking like more lax channels for calling 911, you know the directory kind of stuff or calling baseline that is less urgent than 911 utilization at times that kind of line for discussion regarding process interaction and the kind of healing and repairs especially for lives that were not suppose to emerge supposedly. Consult:<br>Mobility and Construction. <br>Earth-Based Transportation.<br>Earth-Based 911 <br>(The Urgency and tone similar though like the call line you can use for 911 for less urgent situations.)<br>Earth-Based Rigging<br>Earth-Based Theatre<br>Earth-Based Charity<br>Earth-Based Entertainment<br>Earth-Based Resources and Supplies<br>What kind of scrappy thing can we do to gather resources decently. <br>Resources gathering and those that we can consult on the street, the beggars, buskers and gangsters. As of late the street has felt suppressed on my end at least in regards to this process but more than that I think. What is the simplistic message for this project and what can we provide back towards. Again the idea is to heal, repair and maintain. It&#39;s not just in regards to this process but the idea remains for me to heal certain processes that have come into contact that need healing and repairs. It&#39;s not to abuse the effort of coming up with this idea and writing it down in a book especially to garner resources. Repair, Maintenance and Healing.<br>Permit spiritual and Viability. Logistics.<br><br><br><br>So this project intended on my end to alleviate and help joe process on Earth-Based. <br><br>For working, appeasing workers in knowing that they are working for something worth working for and discretion for some that didn&#39;t want to know. <br><br>Migration <br><br>Day Testing in regards to certain kinds of maneuverings and ways of operating to see what that actually looks like in translation on the map. Discussions of this idea of planning and the what it looks like on the map. The idea to implement idea that at times haven&#39;t always implemented exactly as it is in the pans. What are some of these plans? <br><br>What is it that spiritual can do to help the following five regarding Earth-Based?<br><br>Work<br>Commute<br>School<br>Home<br>Food and Water<br><br><br>What is the mandate for life path direction that changes especially upon life direction not intended to change in certain manners. What of the resources regarding such life path and what of life path utilization from others upon life path changing. <br><br>Reputational Defense.<br><br>Ways that the good can give time to the bad guy? Time. Ways of life facilitation. Interaction systems. What is the realistic. Giving leeway to those that my Main Spirit Guides in regards to bad regarding training. If this is defense related, workshops and defense team placement beforehand if possible but not all areas work that way. <br><br>Activity:<br>This day felt to be one in which certain revelation was going to take place and a note of other kinds of facilitation, like being able to operate always without an Authority presence. The idea that we should be able to operate spiritually without certain Authority always being present, my process is different at times but the ways dimensional setup can work, can remedy in many different manners regarding those who are requesting less of an Authority presence. It&#39;s also the proven that we should be able to proceed without certain Authority presence but safety at times dictates. These days I have felt strong Authority presence throughout although there is still distancing taking place. <br><br>What would be without the High Command wiping our asses for us and to be true some of wouldn&#39;t know how to wipe without them. It seemed to be the good introductory for how some of the spirit felt today and maybe on other days as well given the kind of difficulty and ease to set single days for specific tasks instead of the daily spread or pick a couple days a month kind of thing. What I would surmise is that the bowl is half full but nobody said what kind of contents filled the bowl. To appease the the dark feathers of red, I must write something. The scare tactics seem real enough even if my writing comes off a bit much. The bloodshed and death of the kinds of horror depicted to exist seemed to carry the colour of this process at times. Then of course you had my incessant chirping and defensives in which didn&#39;t always add keg to the gunpowder.  I thought there might have been something in the old days where spiritually they threw the empty Gun powder keg in the cannon shot dimensionally. Maybe half expecting there to be some sort of history moment where see some spiritual teaching a new trick with cannon shot during the golden ages of pirates. I wonder what the comments read on the instruction for such a go getter kitchen sink metaphorical. I thought it to be a common to be true when the powder ran empty and knowing the cutlery in the cannon move I thought there might some sort of dimensional feng shui to throwing the barrel across the way.
