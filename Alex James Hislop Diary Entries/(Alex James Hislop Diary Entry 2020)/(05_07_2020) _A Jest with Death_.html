<div class="title">(05/07/2020) &quot;A Jest with Death&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Quote:<br>“The purpose of our lives is to be happy.” <br>— Dalai Lama<br><br>“Life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans.” <br>— John Lennon<br><br><br>Activity:<br>I have seen many beings of death in vicinity and have felt their presence more than have seen them. Swirling dark and black energies but it&#39;s not the only kind. How can such beings exist in capacity and only receive such shoutouts and cultural impact upon physical earth-based and spiritual earth-based and some say it&#39;s by it&#39;s nature but at what point do I not notice national forces and realism feng shui only to be usurped by death itself literal incarnate for some and others beings and forms of such for some that claim entertainment for a portion might be correct but wouldn&#39;t be correct in claiming as such upon the entirety. Even within vicinity upon me at times within the past seven days and it&#39;s one of wide open spaces of revelation upon such culture at times that has been explained and put fourth in many ways in which those culture find clouth. Still it&#39;s one of the flags in the mix. Talk of creation, whit light emergence and death circling in literal forms. The tell to those that were thinking that I need to die was told and then I pointed to the fact that is there not those that know the situations enough to understand I am going to be here for another 40 or 50 years? Of course there is. Interaction spoken about in many capacities and I could feel a concept get harassed a bit these past couple days with the flighty low energy and forecast of ominous good. Awakenings seen within my self. More lucid, clarity and awareness observed. Spiritual transitioning at times through out the experiences. Proximity and vicinity still receiving turbulence here and there especially on certain days within the past week. Continued trying to haring and harass upon scheduling even when seen that I still work on my life, even with coupling myself with spiritual in regards to myself that did not want to continue living this life and that want transportation out of this life. Transportation was another topic especially on the 6th and 7th as well as on the at the end of April. I painted on the first, second and third as well as the 4th for what I remember. It seemed to have caused certain kinds of interaction problematical especially while watching certain kinds of content. Situated was what happened upon the ghosts of nightmares and the tells within actions. Some trying to continue to maneuver storylines both against and for in certain moments within the past 7 days. Heavy promptings in regards to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated upon influences supposedly aimed in similar direction albeit more extreme. A storyline of certain family leaving and utilization of energies either in emulation or in utilization of which was supposedly the reason why I was heavy prompting in which doesn&#39;t make sense upon the kind of influencing from those saying they don&#39;t want that to be and trying to ignore my proxies for what they are indicating. The idea is that some wanted me to be heartbroken lending towards credence of some getting attacked and potentially trying to have some be attacked by that and the denial being utilized saying that some did not get attacked when at times they did. Then it was to be a segway of going crazy and losing ones mind which gives reasonings for why some authority would try and go the direction of controlling the information that I create and variables within my in which might also lend towards more attack to others. Then we see an economic thing happen within my informational creation, some dehieghtening it for what it&#39;s worth which lend credence to the information beforehand in a certain manner with life utilization in the mix that supposedly can do a better jiob than me but a portion not focusing on what I would focus and the utilization of such economic hits while decent because when you look at my physical information I created it&#39;s fairly simplistic even with anchoring advanced spiritual information at times but the anchors were everywhere to be true, especially if talking about informational placement. Of course that sort of thing I have been trying to maneuver away from in the more important being protected but rather the right of protection and quality of life dictating as such. <br>There was a battle for earth past seven days and each day I have discerned good winning not only in vicinity with certain accord lending towards subpar experiences and on the outside proximity a hitting home and Good winning the battle for what it seemed. They said something happened on the fifth which made action happen on the 7th, but it;&#39;s scattered all over the past seven days both good and bad actions at times, lumping and larger groupings as such on certain days. Was the fifth one of those days?<br>Energies was spoken about the past 2 days and so was this lingering recovery of weed smoking in a crystal moment of clarity something passing through me yesterday like a side affect that doesn&#39;t have to do with weed for a portion but rather something else. the 3rd and 4 were quite days and then some wanted to measure the talkative following days in which were seemingly facilitated in what some wanted me to respond with coherent and intelligent points throughout the day. Trying to go after true good was a part of the direction on the 5th and the 4th but seemingly fizzled out only garnering a couple comments on my end which is quite not much of anything to stand in the way of the True Good and we can see earlier though a direction that had been working, straight realism and working with while letting know that true good has arrived and is arriving and that direction still exists and has been employed in this process. On the 5 and the 6th they tried to make it this off to the side, crazy spiritual that has somehow crossed boundaries in what they are prompting rather than the intelligent promptings that were happening finely tuned for certain direction as we that my Main Spirit Guides indicated continue to go with what our Main Spirit Guides indicated. Earth-Based on the sixth was cleaned up and I had been spiritually on earth-based for the past 4 days within the past week. There has been a tell of smalls this past couple days as well, some sort of spiritual emergence taking place or already took place in what might have been past overlap interaction. All throughout the past seven days they have continued to enlighten and harass with certain formology utilization in which I have seen multiple infrastructure be utilized in many different dimensional upon my interaction. How is it that those interactions are taking place and how do they know my fantasies, dream, hopes, nightmares and fears? The answer lies within the fact that there is substantial energies sometimes throughout life, literal tangible energies in regards to a reaction to a certain circumstance or thoughts earlier previous. As has been mentioned is that history knows and understands a great portion of knowledge by way of awareness and even that kind of tell where you might ask yourself if pursuing your dreams below certain lines are worth such a pursuit and the answer is yes. As has been seen many safeguard that kind of thing but at what point do you not pursue your life especially upon the morrow of forecast in what could happen and at what point do you turn into that holy man on the mountain for how you wanted to view yourself. For some it&#39;s being crass and brutal honest with inflection of pen to the dark side even in minute and less cared for ways compared to the bulging extremes of the truly. Still there is something to be said of smalls especially those seemingly. Can you imagine a dark group trying to antagonize who one is by way of not liking what kind of response and tactic certain kind emerge from by way of pursuit that in which some say we shouldn&#39;t even in a manners sort of way. It spoke to me more of those that are of Business and War, even Society rather than those dark powerful up above that are not. I love War and I don&#39;t think the concept is to blame for the utilization of war and utilization and concept have an interesting relationship.
