<div class="title">(02/01/2020)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>A pickup to myself and soul this past week received updates in regards to infrastructure as well as new direction. I could feel a spirit in regards to myself in vicinity at times and certain kinds of spiritual refreshers and updates upon myself. It will be interesting to see whether I can get past this point in my life of laying around slothful kind of days.<br>-Defense points talked about the day before in which hit home fairly well. One in which happened to do with future and again letting know for legal, non-legal and light as well as other kinds to mark it down upon moments where I discern that there could be future points that are utilized against me because of decisions in the present. Another on happened to the pointing out that the bringing up of defense points for a portion have been natural bringing up of points and cards.<br>- Memory has been a part of the discussion as well especially in regards to me changing up parts of my memory tabs and prompting good to try and rescue and change some of the memory infrastructure, not to upset certain spirit but because I felt it has been needed. <br>- History has been a discussion point this past couple days. <br>- I have continued to display AJHD documents.<br>- A spirit that had been trying to continue further those usually reasons of attack in regards to myself. <br>- Skipped review content yesterday but I still stand by that I feel it is a decent and that it can be by way of listing some of things happening within my process by way of monthly recap and that other spirits should receive leeway. <br>- I have been defending myself with Angels and good watchers as well as good spirit this past couple days throughout with certain points of defense. <br>- Another kind of thing happened by way of bringing up certain politic leader likeness and an opening in my head area pertaining to how I have viewed <br>- They are trying to change a certain kind of internal perception in regards to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated pertaining to how we view the world, like two physical relationships. For example the workings of physical politics from the lens of allpersonal pertaining to the physicals and other dimensional politics through that as well specifically in regards to what the physicals are going through but I also feel there is a problematic and not so in regards to physical leadership in regards to some of this information. I discern this group to be good but has been put in a situation where they feel the need to go that direction. Certain kind wanting me to partially go farther in a certain sense pertaining to a combining that had happened during watching certain content but also some trying to affect certain kinds of anatomy in which does have an impact in a certain manner. Some went off the rails and are potentially trying to influence and manipulate certain dimensional anatomy behind the scenes. Light, what the heel is going on? <br>- Honesty and Respect emphasizations, it has been said that a spirit has been conversing with me and impacting how I view the world behind the scenes in which I can feel other kinds of facilitation regarding. This I discern to be good and different from the one that is trying to change certain things more erratically. There was moment throughout the the content watched where I noticed that there were themes of some of the happenings in the years recorded contrasting in which told a story. <br>- Certain kind of spirit, presence, multiple in which looked dark but not necessarily bad, looked to be portals but there was presence. Felt maybe another ten in the background at one point. Moment in time kind of spiritual overlap.<br>- Thought on certain people and Arm and leg attachment happened where it looked like smooth channel and expression of surprise.<br>- joked comedy for a bit in a situation that looked to be trying to gather and a battle commencing. Spiritual feng shui of personality and voiceworks. <br>- really looked like things are done for the Spirit trying to work against me and others, it looked liked some of the things to such a degree that some of the bad Spirit in regards to me and others as well as partial Earth Based had unraveled to reveal that there really hasn&#39;t been reason to be working against most of us.<br>- There was a couple points brought up in a certain fashion in my computer room with the spirit. One had to do with those higher up spirit especially those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in which remind of older events in the light and Original Setting where the Original Creator Whisked away a certain group of spirit upon battle and decision upon a certain kind, because of events that would happen later on it would culminate in a group of spirit that some would never see again for a portion. Many of these spirit are good, innocent and compassionate. I asked those that my Main Spirit Guides regarding the questions that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. One of which happened to do with whether they thought those trying to traverse to protect their God Spark and situate what they were experiencing were in the correct. I asked whether they sided with them in the capacities that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. Do note that their are safeties in regards to this as their has been for a long time now, regardless of whether I am in front of the scenes, powerful or incarnate. The answer was said to be for a portion that they do feel that those trying to protect themselves in what they experience and trying to defend and move their God Spark experiencing suffering and pain were in the correct and it was left at a certain spot supposedly. When then bringing up the Aspect of God that my Main Spriit Guides indicated in which could save instantaneously all that is, I felt there to be a moment of interaction take place where the point had been made. Where a certain kind in the Light have the right of way to be able to defend their other dimensional selves as well as other kinds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. It was interesting upon bringing up other points outside my house when I went for a walk, in which I had brought up previously in my office room. They say I was vindicated but I feel I was already vindicated to be true. Those places where I wasn&#39;t vindicated in the context that my Main Spirit Guides indicated I don&#39;t know if I want to reside dimensionally in those areas anyhow. The bringing up of what had happened earlier in that certain bad spirit in this process no longer have a certain kind of reasoning to be here and it was actually for a large portion having to do with those spirit that pretend to be good in which have been looking for justifiable reasons to attack myself spiritually. I am good and moral, incarnated from Higher Light or so I feel that to be the case. There might be other aspects of myself in which are from different areas and some of which might have to do with retrieval but the way I look at my God Spark in the ways that my Main Spriit Guides relayed in the Light makes me feel that I am not bad and that my physical perspective and the mover of this physical body that being me in the ways that my Main Spriit Guides indicated has been trying to help. There were some that tried to let know that I had not been attacked spiritually and I had wondered if that included my family to a certain degree as well as the others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. In a pivotal moment with understanding about these points in this paragraph well understood I brought up some of my physical family especially those in which had been brought up in this process to a certain degree in which are innocent and decent in the ways that my Main Spriit Guides indicated. With a spiritual support and knowledge of certain kind feeling that there are those with the right of way to defend themselves below certain thresholds and the fact that some of those that have been attacking me at times don&#39;t have the reasonings to do so, with my actions and non-actions spiritually only pertaining to what my Main Spriit Guides indicated, it felt like it acted as a defensive in regards to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated being attacked spiritually and physically. It was let know by myself and others that my Main Spriit Guides indicated that we are prompting these points in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The truth though is that I don&#39;t have to bring these points up to be defended. Industry was brought up as a smoke and mirrors and maybe a tell as to where I was spiritually for a portion but being outside walking had also changed the variables in regards to bringing up these points spiritually but only for a portion.
