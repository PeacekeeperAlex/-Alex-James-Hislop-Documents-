<div class="title">(01/23/2020) &quot;Not Oblivious&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Quote:<br><br><br>Activity:<br>Today has been an extension of that new direction in regards to myself in which I feel it also pertains to to her spirits as well ultimately. I feel this to be so far a better direction by way of less spiritual arguments even if I feel those to be a decent in the mix. I wont know until I get back to the Light upon passing how much those argumentatives were actually a decent at times. Granted there was turbulence and difficulties in regards to some of the spiritual disagreements and arguments pertaining and there was a kind trying to say that that was one of the problematic within this process but to be truthful I don&#39;t agree with some of the insinuations as to what happened to me pertaining. When we throw it to others in the mix that potentially did not benefit from me arguing, there is a portion and potentially the larger portion that did not deserve to receive turbulence and conflict from my arguing. To be true I feel like my soul and spirit needed to not experience certain kinds of arguing in the Open Channel Ability pertaining to my psychictivity in which I feel is beneficial to me and others that my Main Spriit Guides relayed. This movement and Change that seems to be taking place speaks at times of other kinds on Earth-Based. I fear that there are those that are experiencing similar things as to what I have experienced spiritually and I do feel that is a small percentage of Earth and I can help but hope that the changes taking place and the good life being invoked are not just within my process but others as well. <br><br>-( I discerned cooking skills depart from myself today and some claiming the movement of dimensional anatomy being because of point facted out in regards to those trying to put energy hits on me in which for a portion has been decent but there being a kind literally trying to deter and delay even in regards to regular life and I fact more so than ever doing advocations which might have to do with resource allocation. Some trying to blame the interaction systems that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in which the story of redemption has already commenced as well as vindication of innocence in conflict. Sure some didn&#39;t necessarily want to have to be near me to facilitate my action and non+actions but the truth is that it had more to do with some of the spiritual continue to traverse me.  Either way I feel after some of the turbulence and attack to blame some of those that had been attacked to be of audacity and not the good kind. Gaul goes only so far and the truth in the matters having to do with my actions and non-actions as well as action attachments speaks of a spirit and other-dimensional kind that have not done anything and for a portion have been wronged. I went my direction for multiple reasonings and I am still doing similar things to the schedule I listed just not a regularly or consistently as I had been trying to attempt previously for reasonings that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.)<br>-(You have seen what it has been for me. You have see the difficulties in regards to continue going on my end, the threats and the attacks. The unfairness and the different kinds of life utilization. We have understood there to be those blocking god spark from doing certain endeavours in certain areas. We have understood there to be a blocking of certain kind of technology and ways of life in regards to being able to get a certain productivity done in a certain manner. Now if there is this kind of thing in which says a portion of my god spark haven&#39;t been doing anything in certain areas, why exactly is that? This isn&#39;t just about me but others as well too. We move past that topic of discussion and map out who I consider my God spark to be, we move past that discussion and map out who those that my Main Spirit Guides consider there God spark to be. There is life utilization that is not sanctioned for a portion in certain areas. Even a proton of them though pertains to what I am about to type and some of what I have listed who do want to be able to contribute and who have been trying to contribute at times. And the there are those that don&#39;t want to contribute in which a portion shouldn&#39;t have too anyhow except that there is variable in which there is problematics and positions of power can be seen in the light up to a point. Another aspect of this has to do with life utilization in what those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated consider their God Spark to be and if life utilization is involving our own God Spark at times. For example the said that a certain unsanctioning of life utilization in regards to likeness and characters and things of that nature is understood to be different for when it is being utilized with a portion of God Spark of one&#39;s own self in ways in which said God Spark did not consent and is being forced to experience in ways in which is dictating life path and also utilization to steal life as well as force to experience life not intended. In the mix of this is groups though on either side of this discussion sanctioned and unsanctioned life utilization in which at times has been forced into positions in which negated the ability, desire and drive to do what one wanted to do within life and their is a defense variable example that does matter at times. A person incarnates, and another Spirit combines with that person and hijacks that life with psychological and other kinds, manipulates and influences that person into doing things they didn&#39;t want to do and also tries to claim that that life is their own at the same time. There is a variable in which is making it difficult to proceed with what either intended to do with that life. At the same times some are being labelled pretender God Sparks as well in which are not in which is making it even more complicated. Other-dimensional selves being labelled as the ones who are stealing life and then you have those stealing life pretending to be the real ones. In the spirit there is a portion that knows the truth and considering the amount of discord at times some of these variables have caused, going towards some of these dimensional areas to understood the truth in such matters is not only advisable in a certain sense but also a regardless pertaining to a portion as the truth is being displayed at times in loud ways. One of the points though so that for a portion of God Spark other dimensional selves that truly are and even for a portion of life utilization that is not, that the reflection of how I am proceeding is sometimes pointing towards truth for these other dimensional selves as well and it might be worse for a portion considering where some of them are located and not being as necessarily in front of the scenes as I am. Continued energy hits, bad experiences and certain kinds of threats, strong arming and incentives as well just wanting to live a peaceful life is sometimes making it difficult for some to even proceed with what some would point towards as regular life. We have seen my schedule changes and what exactly I have been doing with my life and the real truth is that it isn&#39;t as scary as what some are thinking and it&#39;s not the boogeyman that some thought it to get which should not fallback on those behind the scenes especially those that do alot more than I in regards to defense and informational placrment.)<br>Certain kind of moment and talking points today involving a wide range.<br><br>Ideas: <br>Document for those trying to point out and let know of situations that is happening to us in the ways that my Main Spriit Guides indicated given consent. The consent information in regards to this. <br><br>Themes: <br>#InsinuationsOfOtherDimensionalSelves #ReasoningsForNotHelping #Threats #Incentives #Peace #Attack #LackOfDefense #Intimacy #Care #Compassion #Demeanor #Character #Personality #Mentality #Ality #Attitude #Intention #MaintenanceResources #Saving #<br>#Supplies #Saved<br></div>
