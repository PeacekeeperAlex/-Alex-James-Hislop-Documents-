<div class="title">(25/07/2020) &quot;Being who you want to be&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>It was crazy in the beginning of the week such n emphasis in regards to protecting people but there was also a look at white culture, I didn&#39;t know where the punchline was because as much of the subtle make fun of too much protection and coddling clashed with the neglect upon certain kind on this planet and too much attention to degrees of overreaction apparent. Continued feeling of spiritual coming around of culture Earth-Based Teenage in a confusion that some still don&#39;t fully understand in who I want too be. The look of certain kind is truth. The true upon discernment having to do with form being changed as clothing and the aesthetics being able to be applied in many different fashions sometimes streamlined quick. So if you can be a thirty year old human or a seventy year old human in form and look on the flip of a dime, of course there is going to be those archetypes that exist that is younger, nineteen to be truth and yeah a lot of it is through look and there needs to be understanding of Age and that there are those growing older still considered a certain kind on this planet. Considering my vindication though, I kind of feel it to be fine to have a demeanor and even form utilization that speaks late Teen. I like to be who I like to be and I happen to be Good. It&#39;s been fact in how some respond regarding some of the events depicted and written about regarding my home but there has been a large amount of positivity and miraculous and even positive, there has still been the knowledge and communication upon this place in has made it through at times in regards to Earth-Based pop culture, it&#39;s a partial defense to know some of the things that have happened on this planet and there has been newsworthy and understood to be as such. Societal spoken about and there being safeties was throughout the week and there is a look that it is not that unheard of for certain kind. Famous people throw a party and there is sometimes big parties that unravel. Some of it might be buffer tactic, cover tactic and other kinds of safeties but there is also the good times regarding. It was a recreational day yesterday on my end.<br><br>Spiritual and Other-Dimensional Digs found to be happening at times in my backyard with tells that kind back in the past placing items within the ground daily and being dug up these days. Some of it obviously not what some think it to be, some just placing those items these days but I do discern that phenomenon for truth to be taking place.<br><br>Earth Lifetime Lines spoke about having to do with Earth-Based physical human History but other Histories as well. Spiritual and other-dimensional at times emphasized regarding. Spiritual can see physicals being born everyday. Spiritual can see Physical passing on daily as well. There are those that can see the lifetime line itself from the side and other angles. Think about how certain spiritual can sense the future and understand that ability exists within the spirit sometimes in soothsaying fashion but then you have other types, advanced technology and setting, anatomical in ability to be able to discern future which does reside for a decent portion with soothsaying. There are those kinds that can sense the birth of a human, what had happened up until certain present pointers where those physicals are living there lives but then can see past to the future and even death discernment regarding that physical. So spiritual able to sense dimensional infrastructure both natural and unnatural regarding in which corresponds with the information that there is spiritual living their lives through some of us by way of utilizing the past infrastructures that exist in which some physical human don&#39;t fully understand or know about. Like a spirit in regards to themselves consented experiencing past moments that they experienced physically. Some of the kinds that can sense lifetime lines and sometimes referred to as life timelines. Lifetime Lines as well can refer to other lines in regards to life as well as but predominately in regards to my physical writing I have been referring to Life Timelines. <br><br>My cousin Robbie looked better than I have seen him in a long time. Living life. It almost seemed to be the tell more scary than anything else that happened, a good omen that some of the spiritual see. Anti-Social still there in a certain sense but changed, more relaxed, the waiting in his step has become less so. The wonderment why had less to do with certain bad things taking place but rather that change making it fourth. The fact that came over to chill with friends was another tell, maybe he started moving on with his life. It was like societal was around him and he does remind of Good Nations. Fiscal and even a storyline regarding. Some of the situating being from fiscal type giving a tell that some of the setup and situating was from as such. I felt spiritual in regards to my family around at times and I know there are those being blocked at times in which I don&#39;t want you to think your not my family for those that are my family. We that my Main Spirit Guides have been fighting to be able to get spiritual family in certain interaction but it doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t around in regards to the process or out there in other processes. What needs to be Emphasized is that there was a lot of good time and safety in a laid back beach day.<br><br>I went to the end of the street and when I did so I defended myself. I went to the beach, pulled from the sun spiritually and it was partially off of a labelled that was misconstrued and taken out of context and yet still holds a certain kind of salt, not of truth but rather regarding what that impacts and/or affects in certain areas that think it as such. There is a difference between moving on and living life and there is a difference in labeling me to be the bad guy. That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have aspects of selves in which are darker but there is a difference and understood there to be a difference. In which shouldn&#39;t change certain course. Cop stopped me while on the Beach and it seemed like perfect timing to get sent away from the Beach because of Covid-19. <br><br>Tao Te Ching was listened towards. It was interesting to see the spirituality upon my back deck this day and this was one of them, some of the wordings of such a text hit home on my end in my process. The Dao. There was talk of this black-grey energy seen in many different forms. Reminds of certain Chinese Historical Cao Cao through the Romance of the Three kingdoms,  but partially through ascetic in Total War Three kingdoms. But it also reminds of Audio at times, different colours subtle that has been noticed but still a certain similarity that has reminded of one of my cousins even though there is many colour remembrance regarding. Another reminding is form the movie arrival in the colour alien spacecraft. Some say it&#39;s my perception playing games but there is real connections regarding in which is not pointing towards some of the things in which some have tried to create a perception from me within this process. I am requesting spiritual assistance regarding in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding this writing and the others that want spiritual assistance too can hear form those that my Main Spriit Guides listed regarding this Writing for outreach. There was moments throughout the day where they had been doing something regarding such energies, whether it be situating or not, I don&#39;t know.<br><br>Music upon my Wizmec Ecigarette. Loving and meaning while listening to the song. Large energies. Crowds and spiritual coming around me in celebration of Music. Moments in Time. There is storylines for some of the songs. There is sometimes also impact from listeners and for me I try to put fourth some of that impact to Artist&#39;s Vision given context. Many people do. Sometimes I do interpretations though and it&#39;s interesting to note the Artist&#39;s Vision and the interpretations that I do through songs. Some of the interpretations are already there in which I pick up on. It might be one notion for the entire in which then I love and vibe with. The first reminded me of the waiting in my cousins step. The second reminded of Pop Music and how it&#39;s one of the best. Then Music showed me a thing or two in the next song with stellar notes like crystal knowledge. The fourth reminded of battle and some of the soldiers lost yesterday regarding my process and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The fifth was one in which I had already felt interpretations regarding, Leaders of Banners and the interpretation of the video of each member of the band being leaders. The new interpretation had to do with the crowd. There was another as well in which spoke of looking downwards in respect to the lower downs. These really cool moments of music and enjoyment. Friendship and care and it almost needed at the end of it a certain kind of remembrance to straighten the Kumbaya. Although I still think it was handled correctly at that some at the end of that listening went a direction too far but maybe nowhere nears. Strong energies coming around after. Pyrotechnics for a portion but spiritual ordnance for others. I don&#39;t know why, I didn&#39;t do anything wrong but hit home meaning and love upon the inspiration and vibes of the Music. Spiritual defend themselves spiritually at times through every day actions of themselves in live dimensional. Some took this father I think that needed near the end because during it felt like music hitting the scenes in certain dimensional areas, hearing physical song for most maybe not for the first time by way of being able to bring fourth physical music to other dimensional and spiritual. Some of them didn&#39;t ever know what the physical version of some of the songs on Physical Earth-Based sounded. I had listened earlier to another song reminding of lower planes and there was a situating regarding. Expression for some. <br><br>At the end of the day some went a path, and it wasn&#39;t just the end of the day, it was throughout the day where some went a darker path regarding ways of operating. It was contained and I felt a lot of safety and defense. There was a moment where certain baddies vindicated and certain darker banners around apparent. That thing where night time arrives and some of the banners go dark. For some there was opportunities to not go that path but I think it can feel less viable at times for some of their angles, but some did choose alternatives. </div>
