<div class="title">(15/09/2020) &quot;Party Night and El Capitano&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Brown traversing near in the morning. Moments of Cabin and maybe fever in a subtle manner. There was spiritual that was around me when I was younger but rather inner feeling turned into larger dimensional but it was more rather the same spiritual around me then again around me in different kind of dimensional aesthetics in how it can translate as a psychic medium. They had brought up the form of an adult filmstar to a certain degree in which formworks spoken of at length in certain manner but also spiritual colour and association in which I have continued to maintain that people are their own people the way their Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br><br> A crisis later on in the day when a baggie of weed went missing. Thought to be magic and tricks as well as tied into other kinds of that nature in which was righted the next day. I don&#39;t if it&#39;s that&#39;s the reason for whatever the hell happened last night to be true and how I respond in upsetting fashion even to minute degrees while in control and still going with what my Main Spirit Guides relayed especially in some of the interaction spoken about yesterday and maneuvering military and societal. Communication was brought up in which had less to do with the weed and thoughts of where it went regardless of what it was but rather something else in which has been taking place even if I have been getting hurt less and those I care about not hurt at all upon certain insinuations and even with certain stealing of life and so said reasoning to proceed in ways ill. The communication had to do with a certain style of understanding from me in this process. The talk of another going at the Eldest spirit might not have been the battle some had thought it to be especially when he did and does agreed with a degree amount of stances normal regular moral that have been seen throughout History. When my conversation was with the good. Again it traversed past to the kind where I felt forces fighting around me and  continued utilization regarding me and this process and other processes in certain fashions and previous was the star ship vibe in which I felt good presence yesterday to a certain degree. There is Auxiliary parameters when followed meets match for what I am going for and more importantly what Authority sanction are going for and there is a feeling sometimes of unease, why wouldn&#39;t there be. There had been notes of societal dislike regarding me but there was something else and a certain kind that had been facilitating beforehand came around and I wasn&#39;t angry with them and I know it&#39;s more than that and some of it might be dimensional gaming. I was angry with the White Spirit for fear of calling him White Devil upon the kind of dislike from multiple parties upon the use of the terminology. My stances though ar clarified in how I feel and if the conversation upon making the call at the furthest reaches of what it needed to be understood then direction set and my lines defined. Leaving in certain timeframes in certain areas is a part of this but also leaving certain areas is a part of this. What was happening to those that my Main Spirit Guides relayed this day? Just because there is multiple moments of sync even if controlled and contained in certain manners doesn&#39;t mean there has to be the kind of attack taken place and why wouldn&#39;t there be discussions of Flash in the Pan 100% saving invulnerably and creating non-vulnerable with the kinds of things taking place and there was spiritual that saw the kind of set this process is but more importantly the kind of set other processes are as well as in manner known and not known. The discussions of love and personal as well as whatever the hell else seemed to make the grade in tone of certain conversations. I don&#39;t know at what point personal liberties of safety were encroached upon in regards to the average citizen but unacceptable rang in the minds of certain Military at times. The basic of Rights that is espoused in higher light and Original setting is quite clear if needed and many alliance military types especially blue alliance military type enforce some of those laws and there is a prime directive type that exists in many fashion and form. It was green though that had been around at times as well as brown so it spoke of a scrappy realism gone correct in ways that really should be relayed specifics for in certain material not only on this planet. There was though of intimacy regarding some of it and the battle for regular rights regarding having sex and pursuing intimacy and understandings that not all intimacy is sex related. At what point did I traverse within normal rights to those I care about during yesterday and that it wasn&#39;t because something bad had happened but rather congical regularity. Interaction again spoken but what exactly was it from the some of the darker spiritual that needed to speak as to why interaction is being set that way?<br><br>An aspect of self around and recognized with low voice letting know of digital but rather instead of brown it was purple colors. Spiritual equating self to gaming and an emphasis on Self-Defense. They had brought up form of multiple people, and often times it&#39;s been the form of friend, family and entertainment specifically something that I have seen before. It was though of days previous in regards to Intimacy to be a story between purple and pink discerned in which related to a storyline regarding certain kind. Dimensional setup and discernment of dimensional.<br><br>The night seemed to spiral partially from drug withdraw and other kinds in claustrophobic and similar ways induced from spirit even though interaction has been decent these small moments of erratic promptings cant truly be the problem. Hectic moments of not too much on my end with thriller tones with spiritual in the wings and guardian and authority tones hovering although there was also something about this day and Love Police might have been around. I have seen them in this process before or for what I think certain kind of Love Authorities regarding the Safety of Love are. It makes sense.</div>
