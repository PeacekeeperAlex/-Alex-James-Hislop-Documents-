<div class="title">(27/09/2020) &quot;Memorized Memory Memorendum&quot;</div>
<div class="content">I have talked about alities before. Personality and Mentality are some of them and I have equated similarities regarding and their is other kinds. Some have viewed alities like variables and when certain alities traverse to certain.<br><br>Alities more in front of the scenes has seen physical change observable to physicals in certain manners. Dwarfism has been one related I feel to the ones I have notes at times. Pressure and uncomforatable at times in regards to feeling some of these alities in the head area but noted to be able to be fashioned in comfortable manner in which reflects at times upon the physical in some of the changes seen. Head shapes even being affected by way of some of these alities in certain manners. Feels like smooth rounded alities at times in which again pressure and uncomfortable noted but seen through my experiences to be able to situated in manners less uncomfortable in which actually matches the stimuli more so associated from what I have regarding the alities themselves. I feel there to be something about intelligence regarding but also the kind of debate regarding pointed and rounded. Fae knows about these discussions I feel in certain manners and I think there is an emphasis in association of such debate regarding specific cultures of Fae. The fact that I have noted dwarven specific to earth-based to be of certain kinds of intelligence has been noted but there are many that are regular people too. One of the things understood regarding some of the physical dwarven on this physical planet earth is that they too are also human. That is not to say that they don&#39;t respect Dwarven of Fantasy as well as other cultural seen to hold creeds of respectability. Some of the alities seen have been noted to be able to be maneuvered by way of other dimensional means and the fact that there can be good changes in regards to dwarven as well as other kinds regarding this phenomenon has been noted in the spirit especially because of the in front of the scenes dimensional related changes regarding some of these kinds of alities. Downs syndrome seems to be another related regarding and even today we movement on my end regarding voiceworks in which lets know of different ality holdings not only related with more in front of the scenes mentality areas but also other kinds like voice chakra and voiceworks but also hints of other kinds too. More rigid and/or stiffness within certain bodies at times thought to be one of them as well as too. The voiceworks at times seen within downs and even other kinds reflecting that ality change in front of the scenes in which on my end was proven to be able to be situated. It seems like the normality of certain systems especially regarding certain kinds of science and lack thereof knowledge regarding certain spiritual science as well lending towards normality of certain circumstances that can be altered for good scientifically speaking. There is reasonings further though for some of this at times but given change that has happened and been happening provides opportunity to be able to lend towards good change and when Good provide what is needed and especially given certain looks in the future to say that there was reasoning for change within certain systems as has been already understood with some of the adaptability and goodwill of not only the past but the present  and that ability to say truthfully that there was spiritual and other dimensional that did do as the good advised specifically for some with anti-camp decent measure falls in line with making sense. Given certain symbolism and meaning in regards to certain shapings doesn&#39;t always make sense especially from physical point of view when some of these kinds of changes happens at birth and specifically if incarnated from the light in which sometimes flys in the face of what some thought also lending towards flexibility of change. <br><br>Certain systems more in front of the scenes kind of stuff affected this day. Conversation and articulation but more like articulation holding areas. <br><br>Surfing kind of impressional, good energies around from nature outside and healing sunlight discerned, cultural of light around. I remember falling asleep and having that sick kind of sleep energies around in which I woke up and went to the beach laid down for less than five minutes then got up and left. There was a thing about layers regarding this house and how I might accessed one in certain manners. <br><br>There was moment of Angels from It&#39;s a Wonderful life around and story moments of happiness as well as early morning. <br><br>Certain kind of characteristics in regards to myself not reflecting on certain infrastructure in which might have been more predominately beforehand reflecting more of a registry as to who I really am on certain infrastructures this day. Shoutout in regards to decent regarding certain direction being one of them in which probably already reflected on past infrastructure in even more decent manner than what I usually do in which is why that one is interesting to see how it shaped. Certain kinds of audiences and spiritual that can usually note what is happening within process pertaining to lines of conversation that i am speaking on affected in certain manners. Infrastructures talked about and the kind of movement regarding. Emphasis on my end for some during certain moments where i felt instruments in other dimensional potentially hurt me as well as whatever the hell else was going on especially upon insinuations and talks of have it have happens even on certain specifics like certain cliffhanger moments sometimes energy wise seen on shows and film. On my end I prompted a certain kind having to do with dimensional areas where my Main Spirit Guides relayed. Having to do with defense in the moment instead of just sitting back and doing nothing. <br><br>I feel coexistence and those that are trying to get along impacted this day and with discussions regarding. There was also tones of protecting youth throughout the day. I feel it was also more than that though. Guideship clarifications spoken about in certain manners. Maneuverings from other dimensional at times in regards to me to steal and sweeten the pot less in my direction at times brought up as well in the kind of carcophany of greed in what it seems to be. Pointed towards the fact that in the light I might be more powerful than I am now even given natural ability and other kind especially regarding the ill utilization regarding myself physically. I even gave a shoutout towards the fact that the regular light spirit might be more powerful than me. Interactional story faux pas having to do with memory and what interaction is actually supposed to be reflecting. The things of it was was that the Good remembered and the Bad less so, so what does that mean.<br><br>Situated most of my youtube videos by restricting to age 18 in which shouldn&#39;t impact certain spiritual that still want to be able to view my video and other kinds through my video in other-dimensional in certain manners as to what my Main Spriit Guides relayed.<br><br>Lifetimelines and lifetimeline directions especially that in which<br><br></div>
