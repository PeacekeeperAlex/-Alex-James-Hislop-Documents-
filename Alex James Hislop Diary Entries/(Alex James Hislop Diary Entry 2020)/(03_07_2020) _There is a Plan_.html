<div class="title">(03/07/2020) &quot;There is a Plan&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>The plan is seen. It&#39;s been shown and these past couple days the spirit have proven that there is one in prominent fashion not just to myself but also the other kinds. <br><br>I find it incredulous to a certain extent that it would go towards that kind of interaction letting know that it would be me working to be the problematic. The wonder seen within writing has been felt today. Music is an incredible inspiration and tone setter for writing. It brings four an animation and experience worthy of both. Desire to write. Moments that help the spiritual around to feel motivated and inspired but I don&#39;t know what to say for those that find it difficult to be able to defend spiritually without such a variable and I know the music of life continues to play as some of us live life. In certain spiritual areas this is not a problem in the kind of interaction and shaping they can set which helps with endeavors. The truth thought is that there is spiritual that exist in which desire that variable and can;t hear the music of life and they want to be inspired. Imagine though that there is certain kind in which hear the music when you defend in that you are the one inspiring others for when you make the next step to defend spiritually even without music in that you are creating music. When some go to that next place know that there is that music that you created. It&#39;s what they want some of that higher up spiritual to know though is that if they can&#39;t hear that music at times that it is impacting defense. <br><br>On my end though I can&#39;t feel that if I was to get to work to be the problematic and I am not looking to lose that awareness of this process and what is happening, I know that awareness hasn&#39;t been what it seems to be but just because I don&#39;t discern physically from psychictivity doesn&#39;t mean I haven&#39;t been discerning spiritual even in other dimensional through my physical. It&#39;s as has been said from lens of dimensional movement and holds as well as perception, viewpoint and literal lens HUD. The Sense HUDs that exist. Spiritual even said yesterday and pointed towards some of that in the kinds of experiences that are happening around me vary given different dimensional overlap and life. <br><br>I do feel that the spiritual that was within this process before matter and I dislike this thought about strongarming out of process and then process re situating but I feel it had less to do with that in a certain sens and I hadn&#39;t noted it to be strongarming on my end. Maybe on other ends it was something different. They had maneuvered family into vicinity yesterday, multiple kinds spiritually, there was this downtrodden kind of depression from some of them. I didn&#39;t discern it to be about being a part of this process in certain capacities but rather something else partially by how much of some the spiritual events had less to do with me especially regarding whether I work or not. There was another kind though and it had to do with certain kind of higher good traversing downwards. <br><br>Awareness and give my attention to certain spiritual shouldn&#39;t if possible impact certain kind trying to utilize my attention behind the scenes spiritually in a certain sense. I just don&#39;t want to give attention to a spiritual line which then is said that we cant utilized my attention spiritually as before to help situations behind the scenes. Speaking about attention. <br><br>Magenta overlap, something was figured out but I don&#39;t know what. Movement regarding and some wanted to say towards me but it might not have been the truth, it was figured to be different and not necessarily said to be regarding my Aunt in which reminded me of Magenta, but I might have been mistake, I had sense green at times regarding her but also purple lavender. Purple Lavender I thought might have been more on the  mark but it&#39;s been said that we at times are of many colours. There is a spiritual and other dimensional though regarding this magenta colour reminded of incarnation. <br><br>Really amazing energies and overlaps, conversation and feelings this day in working on writing. For the first time in a while give or take a few days I feel good about certain variables that I was unsure about earlier. <br><br>Facilitation of the other kinds of spiritualist that I have been grouped with that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Some of the things noted I might be doing behind the scenes in certain allotted timeframes given circumstances has had to do with being a bannerman to certain banners but also a different kind of culture that has been around as well having to do with gangs. There is certain spiritual holding it down in certain capacities regarding me but there is also time frames when I might be doing this kind of work. There is other kinds as well and different kinds of looks too. United Nations being one of them but included in regards to what I was talking about regarding Banners. Another terminology slightly different than Nations. There seems to be a healing taking place reminiscent to a vision earlier on in 2017 as well as other years. It seems to be  the years I have experienced almost a certain kind of safeguard, not only to be able to use in certain maneuverings if needed to label me but also an explanation of my life. 2015 the look of crazy supposed to be spiritual but really story, 2016 the banner interaction as well as gathering strength, 2018 the spiritual, 2019 the realism &lt;-- and both years with heavy filming connotation although something specific with 2019, 2020 Black and White really subtle clear murky grey at times. It&#39;s almost like I can see a road map of what some had been trying to do within this process and the upwards moving that seems to be at times to re situate higher up above and other kind of spiritual holding it down below. <br><br>I don&#39;t want there to be this upset variable upwards in the swinging changes happening, darker thoughts want to colour a partial truth to be fuller but I don&#39;t want it to be that but not acknowledging truth sometimes can make it worse and sometimes believing in a partial truth can harm as well. I am hoping things get better and I feel they will, I also feel that as this process goes this path, new and revitalized, sometimes upon the movement of dimensional and re-situating that things will change and that it will look better. Alternatives for those away from this process that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that wanted to be a part of.<br><br>Concepts might be another kind of this in certain capacities. <br><br>Earlier Diary Entry ---&gt; Story and Realism, on this planet, there was a look of responsibility from realism at times especially given some of the sporadic nature of story seen, almost an anticipation and excitement about some of the changes and revelation happening with realism holding the bag of safety by way of it&#39;s nature upon cultural within this planet in which is an interesting look upon how infused story is in a pop culture way. Story providing safety by way of realism. There had been also a look upon in understanding that realism isn&#39;t necessarily the opposite of story, it&#39;s an interesting terminology because of the the inflection in how it&#39;s seen at times and how it can be refereed to as an inflection but it&#39;s also a cultural and societal, as well as a way of operating at times speaking of safety in subtle manner at times. I thought about that there is a certain kind of realism upon the kind of terminology utilized and if speaking about safety seen within story, that there are beings of story that have the ability to understand and traits sometimes identified with a certain definition of realism. I know there to be Non-Story that exists and it seems to be those that have hard emphasis in regards to not having story within their lives for some of them. It doesn&#39;t mean they are the bad guys. One thing I continue to have to remember is the shades of grey that exist within life. I thought what exactly is it that story does in regards to realism where there is responsibility and maybe some disagree but there are those that would say that they are keepers of wonder and the responsibility for some of them in regards to realism is providing that sense of wonder. Story bringing wonder to those of realism in their realms and places but also guardianship of such in places where the seemingly points towards something that exists throughout but is masked at times. They speak of health in a literal sense and when you look towards hollywood especially given the real energies in association you can see certain aspects where story and Art are healing people. There is an aspect of story on this planet tasked with healing and enlightening people and sometimes in subtle fashion, maybe it&#39;s why we see at times the energetic within beings of story in the potential to be able to provide such magic to people on this planet. Look towards theme parks to see the happiness facilitation that story partially provides within those places and it&#39;s also an outlet for a certain cultural that within certain places of story have the ability to be able to fully let loose and it might not be to the full degree that some of these places can provide but it still brings fourth more of a variable in being able to speak about story in the manners that some beings of story hope for more fully. Don&#39;t be fooled that it doesn&#39;t exist outside theme parks and circuses because it does in a strong fashion and you can look to the wood grains of trees to be able to see the writing on the walls. Story.<br><br>There seems to be a note of getting back to work, emphasized within the next couple months but also the previous month as well. The battle for homes has been and there seems to be those gearing towards putting fourth decent work effort than gradual ease in which creates stability. Noted that there is spiritual teams that have been around specifically for this time period upon the connection and communication as well as communication upon COVID-19 and the fact that there were more people watching media this past four months. These spiritual teams for some of them have been facilitating work places and I have especially discerned a facilitation of sports upon some of the heart break upon a decent amount of physical earth-based sports being cancelled. I feel the facilities have been safeguarded for the most part but I think there does need to be honesty because compensation matters, not only for those in which weren&#39;t able to be a facilitated as hoped but also in regards to those in which did facilitate regardless. I think it&#39;s the brilliance of the spirit to be able to utilize some of those facilities and keeping a presence that is expected upon sporting. There is darker and more brimstone kind of sports at times behind the scenes in which is facilitated at times, sometimes longer lengths that what some seemingly would consider a part of that terminology. The Call, the Coach and the Crowd is an important aspect at times within sports and being able to keep those concepts remembered throughout time periods where sports is technically speaking being suppressed in a certain manner regardless of intentional, physically and spiritually, I don&#39;t feel it was intentional to invoke what had happened physically to suppress some of the recreational and work that had been lost this year. God, it&#39;s the tell that Cancer could be good and is good spiritually in a certain sense that i might lose an aspect of the crowd but I also gain an aspect of the crowd based upon truth. Physically you see that if we are not careful we could have population difficulties and just because the population even out by the end of the century predicted doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t have to be careful and there are other dimensional that use that as reasoning to invoke certain kind of ailments at times in which spiritual at times. <br><br>Life preparation and life situating as well as the interesting contrast of how some spiritual view it, like if something is observed in the future even after life preparation in the hope of incarnating and the passing on of such life to others to incarnate. Some have viewed that it gets passed lower down and that might be the case for certain aspects of incarnation or at least in regards <br><br>Natural regarding incarnation but also a certain kind of natural look upon incarnation especially during life preparation before the life itself in a certain sense but also the fact that what some are viewing regarding what might happen within the life and how there is a variables corresponding with regular societal life. It&#39;s been an interesting look on this life regarding because it is one of the variables at times in which has been seen to have gone a different path supposedly but it contrast that natural and lends towards it by way of existing. That doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t normal aspects to life because I am normal abnormally so not in the sense of normality but in that there are aspects in which are not normal regarding earth-based life. It still needs to be recognized that this life could have gone the normal route because it does matter if it had gone that way and from the viewpoint of those in the past upon looking at this life. <br><br>The way I feel today with everything coming together, this positive and hope has been seen on this process even during dark times in the spiritual and some of the lens that some look at it is that they want to be inspired. Some are tired of arguing but it&#39;s the realism of such a conversation as to why we need to defense so that we can begin to be inspired that is also important. Some were tired of it but that point is that some were not as tired of this process as what some thought partially because they were already being inspired. Every time I was in argumentatives with spirit there was a look from another kind in which said they were experiencing the positive of this process partially because of some of what has happened at times.<br><br>*Talking about Fae<br>•Talking about Jurassic Park in the past and the machinsims today from that time period. How there is some today that work on such endeavors of the past. The wonder of John Hammond and the actor exists not only physically but spiritually because there was a spiritual in the past good that had a dream for Jurassic Park seen in the past while physical dinosaurs roamed the planet and there might have INGEN types at times back then . I do feel they were able to facilitate the darker kind by way of content experiences and other kinds of setups to help that variable if it existed back then. <br><br>I went to the bus stop this day and when walking towards the bus stop there seemed to be riffing of this process with the Sun. I have noted at times the luminosity and heat level as well as intensity of the sunlight at times can be altered by the Sun itself and certain spiritual within the process. A kind of High story came around me. There was interaction regarding multiple storylines discerned. The way story works is miraculous sometimes but there is machinsms regarding ways of life in the mix. I could feel a realism kind get a bit uncomfortable upon some of the interaction but it was noted the kind of impact at times I am having on story and how story should get a decent interaction time without certain presence in a certain manner. There was some darker types which scared me but I felt good story in the mix too and some of the darker were very nice. I think there might be healing happening by way of some of the events that are happening and maintaining that balance for certain culture makes sense. I can&#39;t fully describe the feeling of clicks and noted storylines upon discernment but there is spiritual regarding. You note that shaping on your wall looks like an animal and there is spiritual movement and sometimes non-movement that takes place. There is books and content in which are sometimes shaped by way of simple noting something to exist and of course there is safety pertaining and sometimes there isn&#39;t such a thing. <br><br>I had noted something dark in regards to nature on Earth-Based. At times it seems to take a hit in regards to human culture on Earth-Based and it&#39;s not the only one and really it&#39;s a spiritual phenomenon for the most part if you don&#39;t include the damage that physical humans have done on this earth in regards to nature. Some of the Physicals on this planet don&#39;t fully understand in their live physical awareness that there is life within Nature on this planet as well as the Earth itself. That doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t care and if they did know that would change how they operate in a certain sense. It&#39;s why books like these and books from other spiritualist are vitally important. The fact that spirituality is emerging in subtle fashion through pop culture at times and within societal itself in ways in which are at times different than religion in the past but there is similarities but instead of just one faith it is many emergence together working towards better future. Teamwork has been seen. It&#39;s been noted the awareness of humanity physical and spiritual as well as other kinds upon this planet. Just because physical humans don&#39;t fully understand at times doesn&#39;t mean that the spiritual behind the scenes doesn&#39;t understand regarding them but also other kinds in which it should be understood at times has been a problematic lending towards some of the spiritual turbulence behind the scenes. There is a storyline that I want to let know of and it has to do with darker activity in regards to the physicals and spiritual flora itself on this planet in which a large percentage are innocent regarding. There was symbolism in regards to the leaf in which I might have identified as an awareness in which has been emerging. The Leaf seen on the Canadian Flag and some of the turmoil in regards to my life lending fourth in regards to certain animosity regarding Canadians in which is unfair considering that most Physicals Canadians and Spiritual Canadians are innocent regarding the Conflicts at times discerned spiritually. Some of the activity seen is that some of the dark noted might be not at fault as well but either way I would ask Story to help this storyline if possible the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I am not going to fully say what it entails as it did scare me and I don&#39;t want to upset the readers but it was one of those things upon knowing some of the impact. This storyline doesn&#39;t just have to do with Canadians and that is what I have discerned to be true but it might not be true, if it is, that might be the Story line to tackle as many want physical Earth-Based United especially upon certain issues. The other-dimensional that takes some of the hit regarding contrasts at times with that in which some spiritual have viewed certain physicals on this planet in the kind of hit that they take at times spiritually and there is a certain kind of code at times regarding but what also needs to be realized is that it only goes so far and there is lines. It is something in which other-dimensionals are grateful for and I don&#39;t fully know how to summarize how important it might be. <br><br>I watched the Movie Thirteen (2003) and I am a little bit in shock regarding some of the spiritual activity seen through the film and interaction of the spirit while watching.<br><br>Advocation Culture afterwards and a repour regarding certain archetype.<br><br>Recipe:<br>Writing - 2 hour a day, Learning to love project, daily questions to the spirit and the Alex James Hislop Diary Entries<br>Content if possible every other day, try to get AJH Diary entry content and AJH Daily Defensives and AJH Reviewers content once a week<br>Spirituality Research (Start next week)<br>Music throughout the week, one film maybe but still try to discuss pop culture especially in regards to film even spiritually if possible.<br>Wrestling, gaming and movies on weekends.<br>Review content toned down tomorrow<br><br>Learning to love project <br><br>#Personal #TeamworkObserved #Success #Writing </div>
