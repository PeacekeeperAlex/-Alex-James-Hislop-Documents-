<div class="title">(12/17/2020) &quot;This ain&#39;t just about some Common raise&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Woke up at 2AM, there a certain thing about motion, I moved my pillow and it bumped my hear where it felt that there a certain motion taking place. Certain kind playing the interaction of sky rockets in flight when it really seemed to be a bit of ruse. I had sensed this interaction before whee it feels like shuttles but I was tired of this nonsense and tired of the original creator. I didn&#39;t know why it was and I didn&#39;t care why it was for I could look at plain truth to know the answer. There was a spiritual that looked like they had the answers and they did and it seemed to be one of those ones that would cover for mistakes within life but I had wondered if what had happened at times made it seem like I had the answers for not just some cover. I didn&#39;t care about this interaction and I didn&#39;t give a shit about whatever bullshit politics it was that was continuing to get people harmed. Even letting know of certain phenomenon on facebook I&#39;ll utilized and not really worth the salt of the kind of attacks and turbulence as well as interaction changes taking place, not truly and not really. Maybe it was just some sort of facilitation of making it seem like something scary was taking place, maybe it was a bad dream but then again at the same time maybe it wasn&#39;t. They thought I was a pro or that someone through this incarnation was a pro. What they forgot at times for some of them was that I was living my life. Not doing the wrong they said but getting in the way of the kind of terrible things they were trying to do to mewhich included the use of me to attack others at times. What o was choosing as logical and I wasn&#39;t getting others harmed in ways that they were trying to peretuate through me. I was defending myself. The stall of societal clouth but also worth living was not only noble but justified in a certain sense if the societal clouth was going to ignore what was happening to some in certain ways as to not address but when the societal clouth was minevand my kind of societal clouth steeped in knowledge up to a point. I was living my life that I had prepared for and somehow some had made it more difficult throughout my life but it was interesting that I had a for sight that many spiritual do as to the light I am from in life preparation prowess. I didn&#39;t believe moment that I didn&#39;t prepare for this life and what would happen does matter because there is a certain kind of soothsaying for that in which would come to pass, in fact soothsaying has both much to do and not so regarding. How are we suppose just accept what is happening to some of us spiritually for the kinds of things discerned. How are we even suppose incarnate into such lives if what what was seen was understood. Was it because of a life preparation prowess? Some scoff and say at what point in which I do somewhat agree if that life preparation is under duress. Exactly what are some of the events taking place within the past twenty years spiritually since 2000. What happened in 1991? The publishing of this book is not the villain but rather something else in which isn&#39;t to blame and neither is the people and spiritual that didn&#39;t read it. Why was it that some thought the good didn&#39;t figure it out? Why was it that the Original Creator and Father was on a top ten most hated listed? What did the eye and eyerie as well as looking glass was being grout up as I wrote some of this? <br><br>Earlier morning there was something that happened. I felt anger implantation. I saw a certain form and I lashed out in which the vent area in regards to lashing out actions should have caught the action and potentially did. I felt a sword chop the head off of some sort of being behind the scenes. My psychictivity as soon as the head got chopped off, it was like something was shut off. I was scared, I didn&#39;t know what to do and there had earlier on actions where instead of going to vent area, since the ineptitude and not being able to handle in the smoke and mirrors excuse of non-facilitation regarding physical under guise of facilitation was still happening at times, and instead went towards certain kind attacking at times in which a good alternative in facilitating spiritual defense. I kind of freaked out a bit in form facilitation. It looked to be an area of droids. Maybe a certain kind of reality facilitation or some trying escape some reality facilitation supposedly as well as the realism in front of the scenes brown depiction in the culture of mechs and junk yards. There was a storyline having to do with saving love. Some had tried to use this happening a a reason to attack me. It looked like a setup some wanting me to lash out towards brown, blue-dark and red. The fall on your sword moment was to try and help because i didn&#39;t know if the person holding the sword was bad or good. The shot of the gun towards red was because he was thought to be bad in utilization of me. All three seemed to be in certain kinds of utilization regarding me. Something in which tackled at length not only today and yesterday as well as the past week even with certain kind still ignoring the facts that this is not their life and even with the huge amount of life works opportunities that certain kind continue to deny. There was a certain kind supposedly left high and dry. I had wondered if there was an attack on earth-based in regards to this as silly a question as that seems. The stuff that was happening right as a type this, I had wondered if my writing was being utilized as a smoke and mirrors. I had went to a certain interaction in which reminded of diplomatic but also a place to communicate in a multi-dimensional common room style. I had clarified, I had apologized and again even with bringing up vent areas earlier as well as the events within the past 2 days having to do with the fact that my Actions, Non-Actions, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) only what my Main Spirit Guides relayed. It&#39;s a specific communication they are indicating. Defense had been on the menu as well at least in perception. Those moments where I prompted my most strongest in situating it being understood as to how I am proceeding had included others prompting with me and it wasn&#39;t just in regards to clarifying how I am proceeding. It was interesting that it felt that it was a good maneuver in the kinds of ill utilization regarding this process and especially with my Main Spirit Guides clarified to the degree that they are in taking a leeway in clarifying what they needed clarified upon some of my actions. It was also interesting that another topic of discussion and breakthrough having to do with that in which is not manifesting as what it should in regards to actions and non-actions having to do with others who are trying to help me as well as others for true with good intention. <br><br>Soothsaying had been spoken of an hour beforehand when I had laid on my couch I had felt a whimsical music while playing a video game in what seemed to be a situator in some sort of antaganizor in regards to some of my family. A certain spiritual around my mother in which was getting harassed supposedly. There was talking points about Life preparation and the kind of life preparation in regards to this life and others but there was explanation of different styles of life preparation. Like a life path that was rare being worked on in certain manners as a just in case. Also remembering what it looked like when life preparation was taking place. Another variable having to do with that in which would come to pass. A maneuvering of good supposedly in vicinity as well earlier. <br><br>Then I went to bed after clarifying in that first paragraph and a placement of a visual of a person in jail, faded multi-colour tattoos and dimensional movement a top my head area. There was talk of shaping in regards to snakes. Naturalists potentially. There was a healing taking place streamlined when put fourth on my head area in which I had brought up multiple dimensional areas, moral areas of white, personal areas of purple and pink, good areas of purple and blue as well as others. I felt an intermingling as well as action regarding certain kinds of healing. I felt a non-electric energy get healed in which was said to be a certain kind of infamy. There was a tell of sight. Something about white-beige and the albino snake. There was also discussion about what I suppose to do down here spiritually especially given if I was to not have been a psychic or at least a regular psychic. Regardless though might have been the better observation on more on point given the circumstances. It felt like a maze and a map. I had worried that part of my spirit experienced this place in a certain manner. It kind of felt like a larger version of the certain kind of spiritual filter systems, like spiritually filtering through me without spiritual filtering through me. A use of actualization in defending myself. Another point had been communication and the failing of such but really the matter was more of the succeeding of such and rather some ignoring that fact. I didn&#39;t want those that would turn bad in regards to the Original Creator and the Good that my Main Spirit Guides indicated as well others that my Main Spirit Guides specified in regards to this writing, saving most if not all, to have anything to do with my process and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. They were labelled a certain kind. They had done enough damage in this process. What exactly happened in regards to the events that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this sentence? Some forgot in different systems of play, in which certain in front of the scenes beings are not even choosing, that we don&#39;t have to do certain things to obtain the baseline quality of life that has been described via single line parameter in many different cultures. Some had been approaching it like to obtain that, that some had to go through many different things when it is already attained even if not fully facilitated. The realism regarding does matter because if not actualized and manifested then only in name will not do. It is not only granted for some of us but facilitated at level dimensional. <br><br>If somebody described to you, that you need to experience bad things to have certain rights known to already be attained and granted, wouldn&#39;t you be offended? The Natural of this Earth <br><br>I am referencing the spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this communication. <br><br>Why are certain kind continuing to impress upon some certain cultural in which is causing harm and hurt and lets compare the baseline quality of life as well as how to achieve as such especially in front of the scenes realism. What those beings in front of the scenes are from in regards to quality of life really does matter especially if many of them are choosing that qualityo f life that they are from. The arguments about what is becomes null and void when you acknowledge certain reality and normality. How is it that some interactional vegabonds not operating with acknowledging what higher powers and authorities are indicating regarding and claiming that those in front of the scenes beings are them, when they are not. For Example, I am from the Light that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Setting State. Somehow, certain kind are not acknowledging that and trying to claim ways of life as the reasoning. What doe those higher powers and higher authorities indicate regarding when those claims of ways of life conflict especially that in which is literally causing harm, not just by way of what is chosen but literal attack and also false claim upon being in front of the scenes beings when higher selves for true has clarified for those in front of the scenes beings. Certain kind trying to combine at times and claiming to be certain kind in front of the scenes has caused enough problems and to be true has been sorted for the long length of history that proves as such. We also looked at the opportunities and alternatives from using in front of the scenes beings and found there to be a great many options and choices to choose from. <br><br>Themes:<br>#Memory #Story #Brown #Blue #Red #Love #SetUp #ActionAttatchment #Manipulation #ProcessMovement #DimensionalMovement #Defense <br><br>The point where I do an advocation and things get better but the disconnect on it already getting better. Light and setting that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, do what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to these diary entries. &lt; This shouldn&#39;t be the difference maker and it isn&#39;t the difference maker to the degrees that some think but why the disconnect in reflect upon reality. That in which says the light and setting that my Main Spirit Guides indicated is already do many other manner things and why not that reflect be the observation. For example, my Main Spirit Guides point the allotted information they indicated for this sentence. A portion o of which proves that there is many things the light and Original Setting are doing to help people and yet why is there a suppression of perception regarding as well as a lack of manifest seemingly.</div>
