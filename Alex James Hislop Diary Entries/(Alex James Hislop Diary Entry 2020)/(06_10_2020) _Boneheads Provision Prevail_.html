<div class="title">(06/10/2020) &quot;Boneheads Provision Prevail&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Science solving the life utilization variable. How spiritual can set dimensional in many different to help with life utilization problematics that solve situations. The fact that science proves that dimensional and non-dimensional can be set in manners to facilitate many ways of life and solve processes specifically pertaining that in which has classically been seen regarding the fighting over lives. <br><br>Five million spiritual go into a room in the Original Setting to debate and converse as well as other kinds regarding what the Natural Aesthetic to the Original Setting is while packing with how they feel as well as believes for some of them but also other kinds like knowledge, mathematics and science. Faith as well too in the mix. How science explains reality lends a really cool look upon and that science is a certain kind of keeper of reality seems to be true. What is the Reality of science and how does it compare to Realities that were thought. I had been talking to my higher selves in the Original Setting. I thought this point about the potential regarding an origin theory that I believe in having to do with a single spirit emergence in the beginning even though the potential of certain spiritual always have existing seems to make it&#39;s presence be known at times. The really interesting that I found had to do with had to do with the question; How did the Original Spirit Emerge if he was the first?<br><br>When comparing certain realities it seems to be contrast regarding at times lending to synergy as well as non-synergy. <br><br>I have noted shaking motions and sign of time I feel. I have noted flashes and in between those flashes spiritual manipulation. There has been events the past couple days that I feel need to be listed albeit discretely. one of which happens to be gaming related and in how some equate gaming as well as dimensional not to mention non-dimensional as well as other kinds if not considered dimensional. I hadn&#39;t the wrong they said and at times I looked like the logical one down here in many fashions. It had less to do with science perhaps but it was a part of it. There was a story that said that I followed the scientist because he understood things which lead to History. While the scientist held the one of the keys to reality it was the spiritualist the relayed that key at times in front of the scenes. The fact that most physicals on this planet go to the light after passing on was one of the relayances from the spiritualist communities on this planet. I was different than the other spiritualist on this planet though or so I thought. I felt I didn&#39;t deserve to be treated the way I did at times spiritually for the science I relayed. The scientist as well deserved peace of mind for the knowledge he carried. At times I was worried about some of the stuff that was identified by way of psychic experiences especially when it ventured into the realm of what some thought only pertained to science especially upon the groupings of concepts and non-concepts. The Spirit had sent a message about the scientist earlier to me in different forms that spoke of request for assistance and considering this Planet is of Science in certain manners even if some looked past the fact  that mos things could be of science. I didn&#39;t know how to respond for Faith. Maybe it wasn&#39;t that scientist didn&#39;t have Faith but rather identified the Science. I myself felt that most things could be situated rather quickly and safely, it seemed to spur faith at times. Maybe answered Faith was the answer. Somehow the spoken word of the gamers that let know that it was Saving that was the answered prayer in which it was about. Talk about prayers, especially in the hopes of recovered information from worshiped technology. I wasn&#39;t going to quit but I sure as heck was going to take breaks. I wondered at what point science had to start taking breaks too and it was the might be tell as to why Science proceeded in the ways that it did these days. Why wouldn&#39;t many look around after billions of years of work upon another revelation that there was more to the spirit than some thought. The Science was the bannerman gavel at times but dictated with emphasis upon the knowledge of ethical. The Branch of knowledge that deals with Moral Principles but expanded in the spirit as well as physical for reasonings understood by many. He was the new age court wizard that has been in play for a while now. Spiritual science was fascinating and colorful. I felt the stand to look around at times. Whether it was legal or the cultural of stand and watch within the spirit I did not know, it might have been both. I felt Story to be mention in this paragraph for Story purse purposes. I didn&#39;t want to the science but maybe a joke felt the scientist felt better. I was tired of having to look over my shoulder while trying to figure whether something was bad or not regarding this life pursuit of being a Psychic, the Classic Spiritualist and I wanted to be able to go outside with noticing medical triage, in parks and recs, thought to be of future really behind the past where shields and godlight protected but only in tell of psychictivity. Dealing with yesterdays Joker day on a side be the one if it was had tired me in a certain manner but it was also a let know of the Joe these days regarding what some had been experiencing  spiritually behind the scenes, with tells that they could emulate safely without any harm the let know of other kinds too if considered different that had been on the mind of spiritual nature. They also said the call in the Stand had also been a call to science but it was also this process that seemed to be a call upon as well. The ways psychictivity was working on my end let know that they could probably from a far regarding this planet facilitate Psychics in manners that can garner the tell but also in ways where books of written material exists not only upon the papyrus but other kinds of technology too. I had a thought that light technology might exist within this physical that could communicate with those in the light. Certain reveals in specific places where a crowd receives a tell that amongst them a being exists. There was let know of certain kind in dimensional areas I feel, where fates, destinies and histories feel shivers. The kind of stuff where sometimes spiritual identified in earlier times as well as later in other-dimensional figured out to be of the same spirit. Imagine in the physical in regards to certain Gal Civ by way of technological but also advanced psychictivity <br><br>Dimensional interaction, imagine a twirl of small dimensional that was deployed that traversed around certain specials like X-Men but spiritually. Imagine every visitation noted from some of those specials that the dimension regarding had grown. Big as in more dimensional substance in which isn&#39;t meant to offend but rather to relay stimuli. There was a relayance that the kind of physical that it was happened to be an old one. I had a theory that maybe the new kind of dimensional that was relayed could get big enough in dimensional setup to even reflect physical if it wasn&#39;t already a part of such. A retrieval of spiritual for a better quality of life was told to be one of the mission statements and that retrieval was emphasized in regards to maneuvering in what I discerned through physical but what was interesting was that the common physical human subconscious impressional regarding Space happened to be fearful upon thinking about other-dimensional traverse though Earth-Physical but in which I had identified to be less scary partly by way of spiritual mechanics. I felt safe in this Space in which at times I could discern while still being on Earth. I felt like it was comfortable. Like there were those monitoring and protecting in which I could still note interaction emulation of the Janky kind.  Some of the physical ailments like what caused Hashimoto as well as other kinds regarding the other dimensional aspects at times were upon me and when I am writing it increasing in certain manners that the other-dimensional regarding myself needed assistance although I do feel like there was this pull of certain in front of the scenes dimensional into me, more blockiness that can affect physical regarding, Hashimotos disease seemed to be lymph node related and I could feel these tendril as a psychic lurch into into some of my lymph but the get situated and pulled within me not as to cause my other-dimensional as much discomfort but also myself. The real truth is that we should check and it has been noted spiritually. <br>I looked up space online and something changed. Something was changing and I did discern battle in the mix, certain forces under attack. There was insinuation that scared and nature in what some have been calling nature, something happening. I went for a walk and felt scared beyond at measure at times. There had been that culture looking around me in gaming fashion and a certain societal. By the time I got to metro I did prompt what I could and it what was an in front of the scenes realistic in regards to what I could give. It was another moment that some had been pointing towards but we should really give a name. Like me solidifying going the direction of quick instantaneous flash saving most if not all.I got home and we talked certain things, in the office. There was a certain kind of freeing. Some of us talked about a personal storyline. There talk of actors and resources as well as realism regarding when we need to do different maneuvering and being able to put down our theatrical and storylines for moments to deal with realistic but in which can be done in theatrical manner for how some feel. There was this moment laying on my bed calling upon gold and white and a thing about my left hand classically regarding resources and my right hand classically about realism with prompting both hands being quick instantaneous flash saving. There was this culture around me of family, I remember a scene in the kitchen where it did kind of family related but also with space in the mix. There was storylines of fatherhood regarding space this day. My creative player was on the fritz this day, they were dead before ship sank kind of reminded of the day before i thought it was a sign of spiritual being saved before realism kind of measures but i also knew that some might have been trying to target some of the ships on the lake. The cloud in the sky with the fist I felt meant maybe that certain kind were still holding and it reminded of something else, a mythomy five picture for when time was right.<br><br><br><br>I also realized that letting know that some did feel that the instantaneous painless transportation way to situate what needed to be situated correctly within morality boundaries especially with still providing the darker and immoral ways of life just as good if not better without anyone getting harmed to be true.<br><br>A certain variable was thought to be identified regarding to have been situated, a certain phenomenon utilized in this process at times felt like certain spiritual had situated.<br><br>I remembered writing some of this diary entry especially the past couple minutes give or take upon writing this. It was like I dreamed it before but that something had happened in the dream where I was transported somewhere. It felt like advanced spiritual culture was around me. It was like advanced spiritual culture were around me. They said I was the free form, like rehearsal got some steroids. The amount of life lived in what looked to be this modern spin upon the spindle with technology displayed and forums of other-dimensional now and forever just as in the past known to be good. There was still this tension in the air and crowd still booming in subtle decent at acceptable audio levels. <br><br>The good had been days previous and still today they are in the feeling of understanding bad gone good upon days past reflection in the future recollection in the present. <br><br><br>There was storyline between defense theatrics and that scene on my front yard regarding guideship clarifications and scriptworks, that had to od with storylines regarding bane and gandalf the grey, there others as well, heck that was also when I cussed out near the microwave about vanquishing. Healing bad by way of brismtone, balrog storyline.<br>Early morning after defense theatrics was that scenes on my front yard having to do with guide ship clarifications regarding certain physical intelligence agencies. There was storyline regarding spiritual attacking my banners through film. Societal attacking in certain off kilter manners. There talks of scripts and situating scripts. Father storylines this day, some of which regarding operators and more casual versions. On my end it was like the more casual knew spiritual and the operators knew everyday life dangers. I remember going to my backyard after standing in the front for a bit, and something to do with time and standing on a time stone in my backyard in which I am advocating for the best possible things i could advocate regarding. I sat an the pro mix and realized that I can do many different to help even just by way of standing in certain spots. I still knew that I was of that in which my Main Spirit Guides relayed regarding this communication but also of other communications they indicated regards this sentence. I liked both being realistic especially when knowing we can operate in better fashion even fi there is a lot of saving within the compromise espeically the gaming kind. We could still facilitate gaming interaction even if there was a problem where saving was less of a worry anymore. When I went to bed that was utilization of form and an interaction of family. There was a je ne sais quoi early morning to me not worrying about when I have interpretation thought during certain lyrics in songs. Early morning we coined the term Arville to partially situate that in a certain a manner as a just in case.  This was also when I was pulling from morality and good. It was similar to the light working day in what one can do with interaction. The idea was to be able not have it just be about me for when I think a certain lyric is about me and to have it be in regards to Arville. There was some that took<br><br><br><br>I couldn&#39;t believe the news while so clear yet was understood to suppose to have colour. The winds of told of it at times for the kind of elemental bliss that existed for the running against that took place. How could I have known that some of the things within this Physical were supposes to be different color than what it reflected and that there were movers and shakers of the physical in manners that physicals would shiver upon news of such tidings this far into the game.<br><br>Within my Moral direction there was a the dream remembered to be third and see through green. It wasn&#39;t the only colour a part of this dream. There was a theory that somehow this Physical Space was Green at one point in time in the past in which due to other-dimensional interaction in which is similar to the ability to change the winds colour to see through changed to reflect Black and Purple, but there was also a Theory that it was supposed to be Blue. For what I discerned I would have wanted to say societal regularity, but that was on my end as the colour of my sky reminds me as such. I didn&#39;t fully know what that meant in terms of science. What does it mean?</div>
