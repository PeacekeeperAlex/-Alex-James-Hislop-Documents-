<div class="title">(17/11/2020) &quot;That Realism after Christmas Soiree might have had something to do with today&quot;</div>
<div class="content">\<br>\<br>Activity: <br>Early morning it looked like some sort of police sting for a reasoning not really understood. There was Christmas party impressional and then all of a sudden alarms were going off in the body and smalls being maneuvered quick times to have some sort of special forces group and other kinds of law enforcement moving in through interaction as well as other means. I was shocked to be true at the kind of event unfoldment on this one. I cooked hotdogs afterwards because I was hungry and it wasn&#39;t meant out of disrespect in the kinds of life lost regarding such change of pace. There was a clarity of my own kind of morality making it through but it wasn&#39;t the only kind and it was partially in the form from some by certain authorities. Why the hell would the interaction change so durastically from that earth-based orientated kind of clear energy feng shui seen earlier. Somehow there was powder keg that some wanted to put fourthin blame upon me for one mention but maybe it was a let know of certain kinds of action tetherment and action attatchment. We had worked through certain earth-based thematics having to do with on my end as well as others and got to a point where if I couldn&#39;t not say a certain single phrasing as well as remembrance that it just wasn&#39;t go to do. Segway to some sort of minute christmas party on my end for a what if this is some 80s action film turnaround sc-fi attempt of no god damn way for when one mentions the Original Creator, one is saved. Why would it be that certain kind were trying to get past intervals and the why the hell not the reasonings that my kind of Morality provided. I didn&#39;t doubt that certain kinds of hollywood were involved in this and the question as to what happened to some of the othr dimensional regarding really does matter. it connect back in a certain manner to the heavenly morning kind of interaction that happened days previous either on the 14th or the 15th, the former thought to be the one.<br><br>Christmas impressions kind of reminding earlier times. It was like they were trying to say something, I didn&#39;t know which was more interesting, the fact that it wasnt what some said it was going to be or that it wasn&#39;t what some think it to be. They I feel are mostly good but there was a a variable that kind of let me know that something was happening as to inn which wasn&#39;t being portrayed, that maybe a warfare had something  to do with it or some sort of line building? i didn&#39;t discern to be that to be true. I got into a fight again upon while out for a walk for a portion where it seemed like some didn&#39;t go for a walk and the distressing variable that certain bad were being forced to have to do crazy antics as well as other kinds to survive but it might have been a compromise decent instead of something worse. Was there multiple kinds in the mix though where it wasn&#39;t that. <br><br>Today my Dog kind of reminded me of younger days, like last year when he was a puppy. The snow on the ground lamented in a fashion and I felt great to be able to see him more happy especially regarding the kind of interaction set. He seemed more care free and it reminded me of winter last year near when I first got him. <br><br>Th fact that Original Setting Beings have Battery Life in regards to saving and healing by way of ignoring of below the scenes for a portion but also other kinds of reasonings as well too. Two ideas really good though, Police as well as other kinds of style data points upon my Diary Entries, like an audio clip to be played in regards to a sentence that is created upon the alex James hislop diary entries obviously within moral reason and given context. There is a a map with red pins and things of that nature with stings. <br><br>My grandfather I brought up but there was multiple kinds of impressional reminding of past interactions as well as my physicals family. Some were trying to say there was disability and older involved regarding some of the other dimensional involved for some of the older impressional but also some trying to potentially mix up certain impressions. I didn&#39;t fuly know why they were around but one of the thoughts had been that they were not given the fair share of interaction needed to a certain degree, maybe it was a relayance regarding certain things with some utilizing emulation in a certain sense to mimick some of these impressions but i think that to be not true in this instance given the length of time since some of these impressional resurgence, they were there here and there before I became more of a psychic beyond being able to see karmic colours. Some of these impressions reminded me of out west. I dont know why there was some trying to label these spiritual as to blame for certain things to a certain degree for what I discerned in immediate on my end. <br><br>There was a moment where I clarified who I was via beige skin colour, Physical Human Psychic who&#39;s name is Alex James Hislop. I had communicated this via impressional in the mentality area. This lent further vindication in regards to something that I already felt was vindicated. There was a moment of high clarity upon the road via communication simplicity that exists. How simple it can be to reach out and get the attention of the spirit without having to harm. If you feel under duress, visit a website, take a bath or wear a suit because all three matter and lend as well as subtract to your interaction. You dont have to do any of that and it could better life path for what you do instead. <br><br>Trying to find a certain kind of holdings area physically in regards to my personal documents to have had upon my death and beforehand if need be, I thought of town archives or historical holdings, trusts in which is a good modifier for the idea of a time capsule, couple that with digitizing a portion of my physicals documents, the analogue diary entries as well as other kinds but <br><br>Ice blue white Blonde skin colour that reminds of elves brought up again but it seemed like there was a lower class depiction let know to actually be middle class and potentially higher. There had been multiple kinds of let knows regarding and morality seemed to be one of the talking points regarding but maybe it was actually cold instead. <br><br>There was a let know of certain kinds of culture where a certain playing out of scenes and acts where we see spiritual do certain actions.\<br>\<br>A certain kind of bad guy classic on this planet requesting what needed to not have to use certain means sometimes more than frowned upon. Expand, What exactly can my kind of morality provide and what can the light provide to be able to facilitate certain kinds of darker without them going to other kinds especially setting up in manners that are harming my kind of morality. What is the answer.<br><br>Editors Note: Hardline context and explanational prowess. research other words if need be.*\<br>\<br><br><br>Themes:<br>#Christmas #War #Peace #Walks #Awareness #Thankyou #remembrance #Radio #Communication #HitHome #PastTells #Serious #Detectives #Comedy #OlderTechnology #TechnologyThatWorks #Debate #Interaction #RelationshipSnafu #GazillionsUponGazillionsOfYears #WhatTheDeuce #TheOriginalCreatorCanSave #TheGoodCanSave #TheOtherMatters #LinesOfTheSituations #LawEnforcement #UnderstandingWhatisMyMorality<br></div>
