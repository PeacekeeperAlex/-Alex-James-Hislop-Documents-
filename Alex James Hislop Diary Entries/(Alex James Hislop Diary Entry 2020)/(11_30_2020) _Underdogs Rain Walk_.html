<div class="title">(11/30/2020) &quot;Underdogs Rain Walk&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br> Early morning manipulation that reminded of a grouping of past process trying to hold it down when higher battles taking place. There was attack discerned as a psychic medium in multiple manners, I even listed off a list with my hands and it did feel to me a certain form of attack, I am not trying to berate to certain degree but rather list my experiences and if the experiences themselves got better than so would a reflection upon some of these diary entries. The real truth is that it has gotten better as well as in certain manners but in other manners less so. At what point do I not realize certain interaction snafus and discernment of attack as well as ill utilization of this process and what point do I not recognize the better my process has arrived in stellar fashion. But at what point do I not wonder especially given psychic tells that are still existent as to what some of the others in regards to my process as well as allpersonal are experiencing. Some pointed to something and said leadership in certain areas needs to invoke and create the change that needs to exists for morality emergence sustaining in regards to some of those areas but how are they supposed to if there is not enough support to invoke that change? Other had said how the heck is that their problem? Truth but what if some of us are experiencing things from that area that needs support to change. That creates a certain look. Also though it goes to someone eventually higher up who needs to intervene because that viewpoint of past in most if not all family exists. Doesn&#39;t it matter?<br>There had been more turbulence to add to the list for which I wasn&#39;t excited for in manners that other spiritual at times throughout my process had been for why would I be in regards to the kind of damage that had happened within my process. That didn&#39;t mean I wasn&#39;t thankful for the good times but I also knew that those in the light as to where I came from as well as good dimensional for a certain amount could facilitate similar without anyone getting harmed. It reminded how some didn&#39;t have a monopoly on certain aesthetic that had happened within my process for true. Was I suppose to get over a utilization of from in regards to loved ones? What was the difference comparison for how I utilized and for how others had utilized in the kind of bad taking advantage of certain points made. Even with a certain respect for certain kinds of gaming there had been some that equated that what I had done outside that respect to be similar compared to what they had done. There was a difference. A difference completely understood in the kind of lines that had spoken about for eons upon eons. My kind of correct interject in the winnings already won and what I speak on when spoken on that for the kinds of facilitation the good for some of them have access too. Maybe the understanding as to what kind of areas this kind of good resided in facilitating this prowess was what was warranted but again that in which was already understood for the kinds of clarifications that have happened? What are the point of those clarifications if they didn&#39;t clarify what was needed and what&#39;s the point of saying it&#39;s clarifications that is needed if it be excuses less to do with need be clarifications. What was truly needed then? I didn&#39;t fully have the answer, but I understood that the answer was paramount. It seemed that a part of the answer in observation of the Good especially from higher up above in looking ones own self seem to be prudent for the kinds of clocks ticking and blood spilling often times regarding the lower downs and the middle rift. There was groups that had said it had less to do with certain spiritual, certain systems and even went to the kind of labellment of higher, middle and lower areas. The Higher for not intervening with the power they wield, for the middle in and of itself and for the lower downs for the harm. I thought at what point as another sheet be seen, in which did remind of famous movie in seething upon the eyes, in the kind of symbolism seen for yet another overturn move on within certain legal even with obvious reasonings that spoke of natural barriers as well as other kinds at times, that acquitted some of the bad and good as well as neutral at fault. I know in the mix had been those trying to spare some of the bad given the unfair in punishment at times. I know I wasn&#39;t looking for harm or hurt in regards to said punishment. Spiritual Legal Systems mattered even if full truth for some of them was not fully known but the scary thing for me was that in which didn&#39;t accept scientific fact and at what point does certain accept certain fact upon something that can&#39;t be acceptable. Something some didn&#39;t want to accept. It was one thing to acquit to save as well as even other means even though the importance could very well be just as important as the next point in that another thing for certain kind to try good as well as innocent partially because some wouldn&#39;t accept scientific fact. A control variable exists within a certain dimensional area, in which another dimensional is controlling residents of that previous dimension and the legal within trying to deny. So the good that were controlled to do bad things at times unfairly tried. That is one of them and when it involved in front of the scenes dimensional at times for the ill utilization and use, I had wondered at times how much more complicated it became. You can imagine a position of a certain nation in trying to defend itself by not accepting certain things. At what point does that touch legal. Maybe the better question for in front of the scenes dimensional was why were they even overlapping that area given the prowess of the good to situate. Another reasoning for certain looking past was certain positions given to bad for the kind of wrong anti-camp decent in the mix in which shaking heads and banging fists spoke of not wanting to hear about implosion. It was an obvious that certain bad spiritual shouldn&#39;t be allowed into vicinity and specifically when it&#39;s been told tell through history that the good coming to the rescue and the kind of morality more reflected naturally upon some of the Good Physical for true and maybe some of it unnaturally for what need be for moral purposes saves the day and maneuvers in some changing of era that might not have ever been seen before if it wasn&#39;t for the other terminologies of history and wouldn&#39;t it be history in and of itself that would know of those terminologies. The point isn&#39;t lost. Except that reality and realism exists for a reason and if it was, maybe it should be found and somehow I don&#39;t feel that I need to say something about it to have it have happen as had been seen by way of some of the events early morning today as well as other timeframes. What really should be understood too by now is that the larger societal normality variable was that in which I spoke on and many other have spoken on that includes a baseline quality of life defined as to how those old emblems that my Main Spirit Guides specified defined baseline quality of life. That was normal. That was freedom. Somehow some thought that by ignoring things down below in the kind of interaction being set upon certain kind at times would be the answer to the kind of shakedown evident and lies told through such interaction that didn&#39;t speak of history but rather some trying to label a garnering of those rights in need be of crawling through a pile of rubbish to attain such rights. This was the incorrect that some of the good these days had been re-correcting but they had been clarifying this point already to such degrees seen on such scales that spoke gave less of an excuse for the bad, even those pretending to be good. It was interesting that it might have had something to with what was happening on my end. A certain kind that had been utilizing physical in certain manner and other kinds of spiritual that didn&#39;t want their quality of life impacted. Some would ask for why they would side with physical at least for what my direction indicated and the truth as to ways of life facilitation existent, not only at higher levels but also middle mass and lower down, was probably a big indicator as to why. They didn&#39;t need to do what some were saying to in front of the scenes and physical to obtain that quality of life and ways of life facilitation for the good providing the outlets and alternatives proven that it might have had to do more with power for some that didn&#39;t side with physical. Maybe that&#39;s jumping the gun but it might be close. <br><br>Early morning this day had seen multiple kinds of past impressional remembrance indicating groups that had been within my process in the past. 2018, 2019 and even 2020 in indicating some of the groups that had been around. I had been talking about conversation having to do with too many cooks in the kitchen and too many cooks within the kitchens. It had to do thought with a certain video game level that I thought amazing in concept and non-concept. Certain attacks happened then right when I started recorded things cleaned up really quickly, trying to do a line building having to do with recordings being more important potentially to defend. At what point does certain compromising of ones own morality get in the way of that though. When I had mentioned earlier, about those that would move to certain interaction areas seemed to near when I had been moved spiritually in which then reflected more past process related supposedly in ending certain kinds of storylines but also updates that ended up saving as well. Again though, in the kinds of attacks happening, some of it not the kind dimensional that some think in regards to certain interaction but some of it is. Sectioned off spiritual of ones own self, labelled bad and forced to attack ones own self is a big issue if that has been happening spiritually. What I had discerned is that the good were battling this night and there was a tell of battle in higher up areas and certain kind having to form up yes again. Except that what kind of normality has that been. Multiple moments in let know of certain infrastructure behind the scenes in regards to me in anguish and I dont want to be used against me in the future which was also another calling out today in the kind of wanting to run the show in regards to my life when I pass on. Of course some of this isn&#39;t just in regards to me but there is a line of acceptability in regards to what kind of other dimensional information I as well as others find acceptable being put fourth in these diary entries and that statement shouldn&#39;t be used against by the bad to not allow through informational sanctioned from my Main Spirit Guides. The insinuation at times in this process probably gets clarified in such manners as to let know of clarificational prowess for what really is going on but at what point do I not see and feel attack to let me know that there is something darker taking place at times. The good have an answer for that too and understanding what kind of good that I am referencing really does let know of importance. I stood outside on my deck after discussions of gaming and then there was what seemed to attack upon me with ships in the sky. <br><br>I walked back inside and multiple moments letting know of something happening, a variable let itself be known that some of this kind of stuff had been happening without me fully feeling it and there is a prowess and line cover from certain styles of play in the kind of not feel and didn&#39;t happen for true. It should be taken as serious as the let know of good spiritual on this planet and what the Spiritualist communities on this planet are saying as to the truth in the kind of good spiritual that exists on this planet. Salem, Lilydale, Jerusalem, Babylon and Mt. Shasta are some of the indicators regarding Earth-Based Spirituality spoken of and my content shouldn&#39;t cause disruption in fashions not intended by Earth-Based unity in the light. The Near Death Experience Research on this physical earth-based lets know of it for some of it. My writings at times hasn&#39;t done justice regarding but the kinds of informational placement I have chosen for some of it does do justice regarding. <br><br>There had been a let know of turbulence so said having to do with physical in which might have had less to do with it than previously thought. It wasn&#39;t just physical it might have had less to do with. One of the variables that some forget, was that people and spiritual were trying to live their lives and it is an interesting contrast with the kind of maneuvering that it takes to keep safe. Understanding that if there was conflict in the spirit, especially regarding Earth-Based as well as Space, who the Agressors were and who the defendors were. For there are many trying to live their lives and at what point upon attack does some take up arms to defend themselves. I am glad I spoke of the Societal Normality variable earlier in which does let know that many defense posture at times to defend themselves upon attack. <br><br>I went for a walk. <br><br>&quot;Early Morning December Snow&quot;<br>&quot;The Google Ads Snafu w. Story, Android and Control&quot;<br>&quot;To the Full Extent of Your Power With Ease&quot; (Called Upon my highest Authority, Construction east interplay inside house walk outside, The French Remind, My mother and let knows of some of the other dimensional aspects, Breakdowns of certain baddies pretending to be good, Further Google Ads in account suspension understanding, The story of why that 500 dollars mattered as well as the others, that there are those sanctioned from my main spirit guides regarding brand and life utilization, Gaming with tablets, lay in bed gaming day, Good presence strong, the continued harassment of my a certain variable of my kind in that spiritualist labellment, those that speak out, https://youtu.be/tobuWKhJaRk , Later on the fight with my parents where it looked like there was a good group trying to help upon them and the thought that it had been the past 10 years not the past five that I had been more aware as a psychic medium. <br>&quot;Remainder Workload&quot;<br>&quot;The Comparison&quot;<br>&quot;No Chance&quot;<br><br>Good/moral Hangout facilities upon wait for if the call is made for a need.<br><br>Themes:</div>
