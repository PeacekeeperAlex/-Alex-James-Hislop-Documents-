<div class="title">(12/11/2020) &quot;Military and Personal&quot;</div>
<div class="content">That moment of smoke and mirror with military and banners operating through me from the jankier kind and different than my own morality in a certain manner even given debate about a collection of circumstances and variables as to what one is truly beyond. There was a moment of clarity during the night after some prophet holy many soft spoken energies. God talking about a painting as well as an arabian tune where before hand there was even higher powers trying to relay a story. There was a pine for civilization in the sense of less grating and argumentative as well as yelling with the ability to focus on the arts. Peace culture looking to the stars while war screams in the background. I had laid down on the other side of my bed and it seemed to me that a connotation had been taken too far especially for the other kinds of perception that exist. That people and spiritual are protected in many different sense but of course the wonderment for some had been not to talk about whether some were protected or not. Beams of saving and miracles transcending for the kind of personal looks that happen to exist even upon small sentiment of the past in which still reigns today. The kind of normality of helping someone in need. The look of defending loved ones. There was biblical connotations and a certain kind of look of life processes in comparison. I was still having difficulty carrying on and there still was jargon more hard pressed upon the original Creator for the kind of saving with ease that exists and I didn&#39;t know fully what to say at times other than I knew that he had safeguarded his moral perspective even if a non interventionist portion had emerged since the third. What was amazing about this was that it was way longer lengths of time in comparison of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd with the 4th, meaning that there were larger lengths of time where he didn&#39;t operate with the more stringent non interventionist viewpoint given it was thought of near the end of the third where he decided to live and let be for a portion of creation. Meaning that it might be remembered why he operated the way he did before more prominately and in normality given the time comparison, I feel the fourth is quite smaller than the other three, it&#39;s what I discern with the third smaller than the second. Anyhow, when it got to that point where yelly scream my as well as protst upon whatever reasoning it might have been that the Original Creator did what he did and why he wouldn&#39;t turn back to what it was before especially given the fact of reality in that he can save most if not all including himself, safely and instantly, that there didn&#39;t even have to be some sort of sacrifice in any given sense of the word and that that would be poetic justice especially in the face of some trying to claim that we needed to go out with a bang. There was already a big bang in the beginning in wonderment if there was a metaphor in the mix for some earlier conflict be done upon the enders game. I think what he did was more gradual and natural in regards to relationships having more to do than some thought. I had thoughts of remembrance regarding my process past couple days and I do note my consciousness and perspective under duress at times, near blacking out kind of stuff in what has been happening at times but what like other dimensional energies near my eyes area being maneuvered. It was noted hat I should write it down upon writing as there has been a small harass and harangue in regards to the drive and will to continue to write given some of the events that happened within my process. I still noted that in reference to safe buffer works that my Main Spirit Guides intended for this writing regarding my authorship that it was a safeguard to keep readership safe but then I also realized there are natural buffer works that keep people safe in regards to referencing history and events as well as utilization of language and the power that exists naturally for what augmentation reliance extends. <br><br>I had seen video game metaphorical on a certain visual partially reminiscent of a video game currently playing in the kind of visual style. It kind of seemed like certain kind were done I had wondered what the life parameters had been for some in what experienced for some of what was being depicted even if it&#39;s a visual that isn&#39;t necessarily what I am sending psychically for safety purposes. At what point does a certain kind not be upset in regards to not being able read certain experiences especially for an accuracy, historical and entertainment perspective in which I feel my Main Spirit Guides have set it manners in which facilitate certain remedy to that worry. In fact many different.<br><br>I worked on the google ads snafu again trying to contact google in an attempt for them to void what need be on my account in the unauthorized activity but there was also the account suspension which upset me as well given the kind of ads I want to create to support my gaming channel. I had wondered what Google was going through spiritually on their end at times in which I feel spiritually they gave me the answer that they wanted to reflect on this Diary Entry Page potential to be published. It&#39;s one of the primes on this planet in terms of largest companies but also internet and digital presence as well that doesn&#39;t fully reflect the spiritual prime that google happens to be on this planet. Positivity and creativity as well as learning and teaching seems to be more in the direction of the spiritual impressional that I see but it is also a technology and magic development organization. <br><br>Later on today moments of certain kinds of reality and microscope reminiscent in what seemed be gaming related and simulation related. I have seen spiriitualityity cultural masked as gaming impressions and iu know there are a decent many good by I also know that I can look towards any of them and know there is more good in regards to them and that the good off our earth-based morality has created similar impressional in the light and other kind of areas that we can look towards in safeguard and actualization.  Heck you can do thee same in regards to life energies and impressional around oneself in knowing there are many good regarding.<br><br>Ghost in the machine phenomenon as a type this, a seemingly frantic Spirit, good that my Main Spirit Guides indicated intervene. Photo and Resurrection impressional upon my tablet. <br><br>kinds of interactions that I have created for this life and the pinging and reasoning it should around me more prominent during this life.<br><br>A moment of celebration. looked like the good winning. <br><br>Past process coming around me afterwards. <br><br>Allbeing kind of iinteractions. as well. <br><br>certain kind of family counseling moments near the end of the day. <br><br>Also a certain kind of phenomenon where in one kind of dimensional a certain dimensional group working on similar things to another group in another kind of dimensional meeting. Forming up of some sorts and deliberate dimensional barriers meeting points in which the dimensional barriers unfold in safe manner and intended manner. <br><br>did any of this have to do with resources?^ lol Funny enough maybe less of the motivation.</div>
