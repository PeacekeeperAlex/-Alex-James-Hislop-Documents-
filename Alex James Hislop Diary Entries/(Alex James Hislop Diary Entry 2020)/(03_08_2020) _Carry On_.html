<div class="title">(03/08/2020) &quot;Carry On&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>I situated yesterday before leaving the house, created a personal video recounting the events of early morning today and late last night. I created advocations, testifications and disclaimers as well in regards to March 6th and March 7th of 2020. There was a recounting within my Diary Entry too as to the events that took place explained in detail and I also created the (AJHD) Earth-Based Night Shift document as well as the (AJHD) The best possible Things Myself and Others(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) could create a disclaimer for in regards to the pinnacles that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to our lives information as well. When I went for a walk it turned into a certain kind of cleaning culture and I recounted what had happened outside on the way into town. It changed into this weird interaction where I could discern certain kind of spiritual anatomy and dimensional overlap impacted and maneuvered. Knowledge and knowing on my end affected and dimensionally maneuvered. Another interaction in regards to the interplay about certain kind of powers that my Main Spirit Guides intervening. Another kind of science group around me as well and a different higher dimensional interaction as well too. There was reveal of good around too, some made their presence be known when I was nearing home and other made themselves let known when I was in my home. A group that reminded of a certain kind of expression identified to be a certain kind of spiritual. It reminds of a certain monotone innocent and having to do with expression and tone of seriousness that is sometimes mistaken for dry comedy. <br><br>Spiritual Channeling through, combining and showing up in regards to gameplay and the adaptive regarding upon actions and non-actions. You play a board game and certain spiritual maneuver to experience that with you given certain perimeters in play. Then I play a sadness content experience in which changes the spiritual setup that I experience and spiritual maneuver outwards and inwards potentially depending on the variables. <br><br>Signals for from the organs in upon certain variables manifesting. A pinging vibration, whistle and/or energy tone changing upon drinking too much water in rapid succession. Two glasses pinging a certain kind of tone and vibration. Physical Human not fulling noting or understanding this frequency change but my psychictivity can sense that and I recognized.<br><br>Eyes and the stacking and happening before crying, the pupils energies seem to get angry at the washing away. <br><br>The tones and vibrations of our lives. Lines of life and the vibrational health they emit. <br><br>One of the things understood has been lens within my process and how there is such a thing as spiritual overlap and dimensional existences in which only certain people can sense, this is  emphasized more than some think in regards to certain ways of life but shouldn&#39;t be over emphasized as some think within the confines of the dimensional existences that my Main Spriit Guides indicated in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. In regards to physicals when they look towards something physically the realistic and truth espouses that for most given the circumstances and variables in regards to this physical, they all see the same thing physically in a certain sense. Spiritually they might be sensing different overlaps at times but there is a commonality that exists within the confines of the other dimensional natural of this physical in which at times has been manipulated to be different and as of late I have noticed some trying to do within the guise of being a certain kind of dimensional. There was another moment about different kinds of inflection, tone and expression in which can be sensed that not many physicals are aware of at times in which other dimensionals are sensing, like some thinking a physical is trying to do something or a spiritual component of a physical is trying to do something in which not everyone can see and in which whether that physical was trying to do that is not as under dispute as some think by way of higher light analyzation. <br><br>The utilization of knowledge to claim that someone did something wrong, a non-acknowledge from some lower down in regards to circumstances that seem suspect pertaining to self manipulation. IE: A spirit higher up above that is not acknowledged from lower down authorities and not acknowledged to be the ones manipulating certain events blame an innocent that had been influenced, strong armed, coerced and controlled to perpetuate something nefarious below the scenes in an area that doesn&#39;t acknowledge the ones truly at fault&#39;s existence. <br><br>Magic commencement yesterday and early morning in which looked to be a certain style riffing off of realism. It speaks of the bonds in which the magic on this planet has within the confines of cultural society in which can be seen through some of them most popular earth-based content. Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones and Stranger Things to name a few as an example to the kind of Magic Realism style approachment in which does impact magic communities and realism communities at times. <br><br>It switched up to a certain kind of deployment style interaction extension of the day before and the blowout that had happened. In which I saw multiple kinds seem to have attacked myself and other by way of other dimensional anatomy and psychological attack. <br><br>One of the questions asked is what is normality in regards to that amount of work and effort in regards to what is deemed as a normal life in regards to Earth-Based Physical and Earth-Based Other dimensional pertaining to a life lived. I though about a physical normality on my end and a couple of years in afterlife and/or beforelife and/or currentlife seemed to be decent in regards to working on interaction aspects of ones life. Some said that another normality might be the amount of time you lived in your life to put towards overall time spent pertaining to situating ones life. There are many different ways to go about doing it but one of the ways I though about was informational placement in which there are many different kinds of other ways as well. There is a variable in regards to quality of life lived as well in which might be factored in by some. There is a range for some in regards to total time put fourth in regards to ones life in situating, IE: You killed 27 insects throughout your life, and putting fourth certain kind of efforts to help those insects as well as programs in regards to insectoids, given consent for a portion. The events that took place throughout your life shaping your preparation for some but as well as your afterlife endeavors in regards to situating ones life. In regards to many on this planet there are those that have helped preparation and life situating as well as life path in many different manners in which has accumulated in regards to a large portion of Energy, Time and Manpower in which at times has not been acknowledge by certain kind at times. It should be understood that there has been enough work put fourth to cover lives on Earth-Based in certain manners in which doesn&#39;t mean that there isn&#39;t work to be done partially in regards to when some pass on and the endeavors pursued to situate ones life as well as other variables as well. <br><br>In regards to myself there is a lot of Spirit that have put things into play in regards to my life in certain capacities in which should be understood to not to be utilized in manners not intended by myself and those that my Main Spriit Guides indicated that have put work in regards to my life as well as other variables. With this being said, I pursued endeavors and have done a decent amount of work in regards to my life probably more than the average human on this planet in which is understandable considering my situation and how I am not the average person in a certain sense although while still retaining an average person label by way of how I proceed within my life at times in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br><br>Family getting angry that certain family as being attacked and the defending regarding certain family members clashing with certain systems of play.<br><br>A labellment in regards to certain kind in which might correspond with what happened on my end during a certain moment of shaping that labelled me that I was getting attacked in a certain manner, stuff like labelment in regards to certain kind that supposedly supposed to be getting attacked when they are not suppose to be getting attacked and it extending high up enough where it is a certain concept that is not suppose to be getting attacked. Some have tried to label a certain number at times like a part of certain groups that take the hit at times in which has been associated with a certain kind of look.
