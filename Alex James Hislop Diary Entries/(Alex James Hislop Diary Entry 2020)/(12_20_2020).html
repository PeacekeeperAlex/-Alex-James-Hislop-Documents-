<div class="title">(12/20/2020)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>I went to the light. The natural original setting state. I had a psychic flash of something large with twirling light around it. Felt like something as dragged down from the light but there was also spiritual moving upwards potentially. I had went towards it. I felt to have went within it but I feel I rather went towards what my Main Spirit Guides indicated instead. There was a moment of cartoon bliss with some trying to save my dumbass, a battle of mentality in what deserved with notions of right and wrong against realism that some understand for how a lack of care regarding antiquities of the past would respond. There was these moments of love and compassion, but also another kind of get the shit out the way realism. <br><br>I had asked what exactly was the reason for not intervening and waiting on some higher up to clean up his mess in a hopefully not related to attacking earlier on to not be a decent enough reason. With future watching upon the point evident emphasized that I do not find this kind of thing happening in front of my eyes especially some of the setup upon partial reasoning for having strong reason to be justified especially given some of the answers not only in the future but the present for the kind of nonsense as to why some of the conflict took place behind the scenes in putting me in harms way. Somehow some wanted to just skip fact about what it was within history before I was born. Wanted to blame me for writing down some of my experiences but I read history books at times if I ever decide to pick one up at times. The fact that media covers warfare daily and the kind of efforts in regards to spiritual info placement was two good observations as to why it had less to do of a reasoning for me creating content. Maybe the manipulating factor controlled by the original creator technically speaking by way of safeguarding actions in the first, second and third also made me super upon some of controlling of other selves and other kinds that had happened ignored by revulsion. It was brought up again that it was ways of life and love for creation but also other reasonings that also might not have been good enough for the reasoning.<br><br>A story about red warfare and white peace was bout up with remembrance of me standing on my bed. I felt squabbling of warfare and nonsense of peace was infuriating for a personal trying to live his life. Wonderment as to whether it was the black and white with red all over of my birth year that reminded. Maybe it was the multi colour of this planets spiritual that reminded that white had been here the entire time. There was even a reveal as such after a conversation of beaking the ice upon looking like the bad guys from die hard upon maneuvering upwards, just with starfox uniforms and containment areas of what the heck. Seriously thought how the hell am I suppose to be the one in containment especially with sentiment of instead of the bad. The real true though spoke that they were in prisons. It was one of he things I had pointed towards. Average citizens and innocence as well as other kinds listed by high authorities trying to love their life, upon the original creator having to defensive maneuver to protect should be understood to not be the agressor but if higher spiritual aiding and abetting bad that are doing as such should go to prison. I don&#39;t know what sentiment stupid had creeped into the non-interventionist viewpoint of the original creator for real to think that somehow if attacks are happening spiritual upon people for what they consider themselves to be in feeling acceptable to not intervene because the real truth of this space is less baddie related especially given how it is suppose to be even with transcending such matter by way of older creeds and laws that would situate anyhow still left me shaking my head upon pointing out the obvious in that he can save most if not all safely and instantly. <br><br>There was classic storyline regarding colour in regards to my process. Pink, purple and magenta reflecting personal. Pink and Purple also indicating Spiritualist. Red and Brown reflecting ri culture, sometimes dry but scrappy saviours. Blue reminded of alliance and societal clouth. White the elder and Brown the younger. Green reminded of gaming and protected red. Yellow looked out for green and had a positivity streak. Orange were a certain kind of special, chill wizards. Pink reminded of healing. There was a good storyline about pink healing black. There was many other cool storylines and synergies as well as styles of play in regards to colour/color within my life process and process. <br><br>There is a person that was attacked spiritually. He defended himself. In order to fully defend himself certain spiritually said that he needed to do more. Coalitions of certain spiritual protecting their personal exists. Those coalitions work closely at times with those of that choose to save most if not all. Their is those a part of those coalitions that do choose to save most if not all in certain moments. There are those who also do rights activism as well. There are those a part of those coalitions that do rights activism work. Sometimes they talk about. This person would not through his psychictivty certain attack and harm as well as conflict taking place. Continued insinuations of his family getting attacked also happened. When you factor in the knowledge that some of his higher selves have as to what happened then it started to make sense. Why would he defend himself is not a good enough question given the normality of defending oneself. Of course, he knew within his inner knowing, of course which was truth, that there was a father and creator in the Original Creator who was more than just a part of the Original Creator but also a prime driver that had the power to save most if not all. Safely and instantly. Talking about rights activism and this kind of truth, in which is some of those communicated truth ever, in ones own home and property, regardless of whether considered his parents home and property, was less of the problem. There was a reason why he continued to say, regardless and either way. Breakthrough. It had to do with the societal normality variable that he was from but also that many if not most from his planet were from. In fact, he had surmised that there was a large amount of population variable in regards to the Space that his planet resided in which was from that Societal Normality variable that said that getting attacked was not normal. That defense systems where defenders where defendors didn&#39;t have to defend was normal. He looked at a map in the light and it spoke of what it was supposed look like in regards to the  spiritual overlaps in regards to his dimensional live. Everywhere he looked told of leeway as to how and why the light, as to where he was from, should be able to intervene. Another inner truth had to do with the fact that there was spiritual in many different areas that could facilitate way of life without anyone getting harmed, near as good, if not better than the real thing. The difference was a negligible not worth dying over. He wasn&#39;t curious as to think that the Original Creator was holding it down for that difference. He understood that it wasn&#39;t worth. This paragraph translated in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. This was more understood in regards to how I and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated were proceeding in regards to stance. <br><br>Another moment where I had woken up and a certain kind of intimacy, on edge in a certain manner and kind of reminding me of a certain kind of intimate. There was battle in the mix as to how it felt but it might have been a certain aggressive intimacy in regards to spiritual. Another thing that changed on my end happened to do with life path direction and interactional changes that seemed a bit wonky upon certain actions that happened to be situated. I had reminded again that I am of personal in a certain context. The above paragraph relays some of the context in a certain manner. <br><br>I had noted good around me trying to help, they are a certain kind of good that reminds of Homes and Hearth but also the Original Creator. There had been some feeling that there was more of a rift than what it actually between myself as well as certain groups and the Original in which was not true. This good came out of the wood work to help and relay, again some mistaking multiple interactions similar for the same group in which ultimately different. Quick and smooth interactional changes that some are not noting.
