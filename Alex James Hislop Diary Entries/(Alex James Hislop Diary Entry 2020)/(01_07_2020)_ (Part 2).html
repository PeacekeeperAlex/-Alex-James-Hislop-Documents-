<div class="title">(01/07/2020)* (Part 2)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>Throughout the night battle ensued and interestingly enough the Channel seemed situated and back to how it was before a while ago like years ago. Talked to some spirit that were in my process trying to Help. There is noted many different kinds of spiritual that are trying to help me.<br><br>There was maybe a connection to game of thrones this day in some of the other dimension discerned in the finale but I think what needs to be understood is that some of the dimensional cascade regarding was done on purpose to alleviate a potential that was going to take place but there was also dimensional in the mix regarding in which was considered to be a tragedy. <br><br>Attacked at times throughout the night but to be true some of the dimensional stimuli regarding attack has been common enough at times to be considered a normality.<br><br>Informational Placement<br><br>I don&#39;t know how to tell the world about some of the things I have been through and witnessed. I am sometimes scared and worried about writing some of the things down that had happened in my process, that happened in others processes. I don&#39;t know how to let know of the continued insinuations of spiritual turmoil and battle, as well as the discernment regarding. I don&#39;t know how to explain fully the kind of details needed to fully grasp what some of these past couple years have fully been but there are spiritual that can in which even that seems to be a difficult thing to write down at times because of some of things witnessed and spoken about. I don&#39;t how to apologize to God for the handful of things I said that were out of line let alone the spiritual aspects of such for shame. I don&#39;t know how some of it fully works, like how some of my other selves in other dimensional were targeted when they weren&#39;t suppose to be or how life I had been living in the spiritual disrupted partially upon my mistakes. <br><br>It&#39;&#39;s one of the God send that I can see most spiritual and people on this planet to be to understand that just because I argued with some in the spirit, just because I created informational placement to help, and that I mapped down certain events and happenings within my life as well as others in these books, that I don&#39;t deserve to be raped or harmed. I don&#39;t fully know how to explain how a spirit channeling through commented once that maybe a beat down and rape would suffice. At the time I thought it was absurd and as time went on in regards to the kinds of things discerned at times I got to a point where I would actually feel that that might be the better route upon some of the insinuations from the darker kind and then I got to a place where if what they insinuated to be true would be the end of me in a certain sense but down here I am still standing. Actually sitting on my ass most of the time to be true and even then some of them still wouldn&#39;t back off and it might have had to do with the hard working to the bone spiritual or the fact that some of them had already seen the terrors emphasized through my own voiceworks via channeling. If you take a look though at what happened spiritually to me in regards to events that I have continued to write about and the psychictivity discerned, you would see that it can&#39;t ever be good enough if even a small fraction of what was said happened to me actually happened. I can see the changes happening on earth at times from a certain perspective. There was this other dimensional awareness and perspective attached to my scalp area where it looked like I was looking upwards from the head area, earlier someone had awoken from the same area and was said to be bad but within the turmoil I had wondered if he was good and being labelled as such. Why do the good need to continue to cover their asses? Who is pursuing them and why isn&#39;t their more covering them so they can do their jobs. <br><br>The good don&#39;t channel through because of these Diary Entries? ...<br><br>Truth, Which had more impact, my physical publishing of these three books or the impact of the Event that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this writing. I don&#39;t understand why some of you can&#39;t save us now. Why continue to lay down reasons for when these books get released as to why certain spiritual haven&#39;t protected me. I am not the bad guy, I am not the bad spirit, they got it wrong, I am telling you. Why does trying to turn me dark continue and why do I continue to hit home in not going dark. With the good arriving everyday and continued proof regarding, why does their continue to be needed some of the excuses that seem to be given more resources and energy instead of saving people. We know their are going to be good arrivals these next ten years. The stacking on the release of this novel by way of having me take the hit when I release my book hasn&#39;t been fully working out to the degree that some had let know of and their are some playing it that way but some of the material regarding was already released years ago in some trying to play that direction in an Earth-Based History Good vs Bad kind of style of play but not even as it looked less to do with the bad and more to do with something else. The area placement they utilized this day was said to be a temporary situation in what I have discerned as some sort of race against each other between releases of certain content and those situating Earth-Based. If this really does have shitting less to do with me then I don&#39;t understand precursor maneuvers to cover butts upon this books release. Corresponding with each different grouping of dimensions, how many spiritual have died in my defense? It shouldn&#39;t mean you have to harm me or others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. It doesn&#39;t make any sense in how to vindicate such numbers by hurting me. <br><br>Vindication to the movers of dimensional trying to move me to the areas that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. More importantly my other selves that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and allpersonal that my Main Spirit Guides indicated to the areas that my Main Spirit Guides listed for this sentence. <br><br>The fact that I might one of those people on Earth in which is considered a certain kind of big and has a presence often times at least for me facilitated in a certain manner to protect content and art as well as other kinds on this planet. Ones where I might have a recurring form and/or character seen within certain film but other ways facilitate in the direction adaptability. This done sometimes to alleviate certain impact and in my case at<br><br>The tell that there is spiritual that facilitate my interaction both good and bad in which there is spiritual teams impacting and being utilized as buffer between myself and content. So there is times when I am not necessarily impacting content and art as well as other kinds in the ways that some think. <br><br>The more they move and situate in regards to certain kind utilize my dimensional infrastructure to try and impact, the more I am wondering if what used to be higher especially regards some of the content and art as well as other kinds are being covered and protected. Because the other dimensional aspects of the art itself and other kinds matter as well. I do realize that some need to make decisions at times but one of the key things in regards to this idea that there dimensional buffer and content to take hit is that some are mistaking these kinds of dimensional with other kinds that are not that. Some of the reasoning is quality of life, resources and other kinds and the situations that some get put in to go dark routes or bad routes regarding this kind of topic and theme matters greatly as well, sometimes it&#39;s not just that someone is being bad but that they are being threatened and potentially in which makes an unfairness manifest regarding the look that it doesn&#39;t their circumstances why certain things were done and that doesn&#39;t that we shouldn&#39;t realistic in a certain sense pertaining to understanding if it has less to do with circumstantial and more to d with something else. <br><br>Dimensional Creation and Dimensional placement.<br><br>Rural prophets and the normality in regards to going to higher power in the light and other dimensional, acts as check and balance. What is a classic direction regarding rural prophets and things of that nature.
