<div class="title">(25/11/2020) &quot;Datapads of Vindication&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Late last night it kind of felt to be yet another spiritual maneuver in the kinds of still holding onto to this process mentality. Forming up of moral and immoral to a certain degree and battles taking place. I took a certain kind of action. Advocationals and voiceworks as well as the use of thought. <br><br>Literal machinisms in regards to thinking has been described before in some of these Journals, physicals on this planet have the power to use thought in many different capacity for how certain machinisms are labelled.  Run-on thoughts, contemplation, speaking in the mind, math equation type of thinking, and even holding points of conversation as well as other kinds even though they have different spiritual machinisms and anatomical still have been labelled at times to be of thought. Impressional invoked by way of thought and even perception upon thinking on certain subjects. Impressional thought exists. It lead me to understand that some of the machinisms of spiritual anatomical were more than what they seemed. Experiencers in regards to science were important. They gave a tell and direction for science to prove. That I knew that there was other kinds of thought not fully known by some of the physicals on this physical planet earth seemed to be evident. The fact that I could think with emotional body had been experienced and even enacted as I was writing some this paragraph. That there were other kinds of thought machinisms and adaptability regarding anatomical especially regarding seemed to be true at least for what I experienced. There is one that I am aware of in manners and degrees through experience in which denotes the ability to be able to think on a subject by way of using memory thought in which I have noted that even by way of explanational to the kinds of degrees and ability that spiritual are able to change anatomical explains how the use of thinking on memory can be utilized in different capacities other than just memory. <br><br>I had utilized this thought capacity to pull from what my Main Spirit Guides relayed for me to pull from and it changed direction, had I not done so, again I had wondered what sort of interaction I would be missing out on but its interesting that it coinciding or correlating as well as potentially creating another variable having to do with regardless and either way as well as breakthrough having to do with event manifestation different than that in which has been classically seen within certain systems of play having to do with interaction. It was a part of taking action I feel but I think there was kinds of this lending towards more than just interaction. Event listings might have something to do with it in the kinds of things taking place. Spiritual Evolution? I looked at a map that said similar events in certain fashions, some of which playing again in exact fashion as well as other kinds with different embellishment and nuance differences that said we had already evolved. There were those from past karmic discussions that had a theory in which might be more than that, that we were already a certain kind of evolved in the past in which we were working to maintain against a grain that somehow reminded of scares of Halloween. Different though in what some saw and equated to one of the most important issues ever. It seemed to speak at times of events that were taking place seemingly unrelated in the kind of tongue and cheek that many knew to exist. Even in understanding the need for the understanding of identifying the difference between the aggressors and defenders let know of a problem. In a normal societal viewpoint in how I saw it in certain manner, let know that we shouldn&#39;t have that kind of problem. Someone might say context would suffice to understand if inflection be misunderstood in actions and non-actions as well as the pretenders of such, like if it be a normal civilian did not know the difference might be not the problem but somehow if it happened to be defenders who didn&#39;t understand such a difference, then would be a problem. What if it was related to keeping civilian and citizens safe? That would be why some might emphasize defenders understanding such difference more astutely. Though even the thought that somehow civilians not knowing the difference between defendor and aggressor brings fourth a disconcerting look at times in which shouldn&#39;t used to belittle or slander given certain contextual circumstance awareness. Maybe also understanding the circumstances as to the five Ws and H of why some could not discern the difference in the spirit regarding such important sense of understanding. <br><br>Somehow with all of the understanding, there seemed to be some who had forgotten that I was defending myself. Maybe the identification of non-deaf, non-dumb and non-stupid in the meticulous and deliberate of those that were trying to create harm in the mislabellment of actual defenders was a part of the problem. The remedy of understanding circumstance as to why some were doing that seemed to be decent and really was a part of the answer but a lack of response and rectification upon those being mislabelled that were actually good and for some neutral was not acceptable nor a part of the answer. You start to take a look around at those slipping through the cracks in the kinds of vindication day around the corner for what the truth really espoused was that the power of now really did include action at times for the kind of sight upon and legal proceedings for those slipping through the cracks. At one point I looked at myself and asked, how the heck was I able to say I wasn&#39;t one of the ones given remedy for such slipping. Literally the kind of things that had happened not only to myself but aspects of other spiritual through my incarnation let alone my aspects of my own soul group as well as the kinds of mislabellment regarding seemed to bring fourth another kinds of stigma and rights issue of experiencers experiencing portions of what they do not want to experience. The kind of unclouth of clouth society in viewpoint and understanding. You have a homeless who is sleeping in the middle of town square and that seemed to ruffle some feathers. A brethren of the great unwashed upsetting the day of sunshine. It&#39;s the kind of look and stare of certain situations. There was other kinds told to me though which did garner bigger brother kind of look from that societal clouth in manners that told of way worse things bumping in the daylight in the kind of true uglies that some want to deny that not exist for societal clouth reasons even beyond some of which we are speaking in the kind of get of town kind of look. It wasn&#39;t just about how it upset the daylight. It was kind of stuff that at times would upset the night times if there wasn&#39;t something else that someone else was denying. That kind of spiritual understanding as to why was the next explanational partially for that it also had to do with safeguarding. Maybe the real look had to do with why it was that some had to safeguard in such manner. Wouldn&#39;t interesting as well if that bum was suppose to be rocking certain interaction systems that his Main Spirit Guides indicated. What if he wasn&#39;t homeless? What if God had been requesting for better interaction systems even before the emergence of Christ. Scripture of vindication. Interaction was tired of being the bad guy. There was a similar colouring regarding perception on my end for when I thought of vindication and interaction. Even vindicated balked at the daunt of such a task at that in which garnered guffaws from some at the easy that such a mask as that was in the kinds of objectives completed. Interaction was already vindicated. It would be a simpletons request for advanced to provide context to what was needed and one of them happened to be explanational of certain culture. Understanding that certain culture was not necessarily good or bad in the kind of relief seen but that there was a natural regarding discernment of difference between moral and immoral. Regardless of whether either considered themselves bad or good. Wouldn&#39;t the control variable of certain spiritual be vindicated for a portion of such a storyline chit as the naming scheme upon this Diary Entry as well as other kinds listed by Angels be the remedy that some seek. For I knew there were those in the spirit that were being controlled in literal to do acts they did not wish or intend and that certain baddies had tried to use this excuse to escape empty handed as well as supposed good using both as an excuse to look away. What was the best I could ask question I could ask at the end of this writing block?<br><br>I knew there was spiritual that were trying pigeon hold me into a spot where it looked like I was on offensive, I knew there was multiple kinds and I also knew that saving most if not all was correct but debate with my past self in why there was more rigid lines defining family told me why I had chosen what I did. It didn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t choose to save most if not all in certain moments. I knew there was other circumstances as to why I chose the way I did in the kinds of expanded beyond family I chose to save. Me doing advocations of saving, advocations of defense as well as other kinds of protection maneuverings wasn&#39;t the only kinds of advocations and maneuverings I was doing. Some of it had to do with regular societal kinds of actions and by way of me being from the Societal that my Main Spirit Guides indicated, denoted that being attacked wasn&#39;t a part of that regular societal normality variable nor was it a part of the Rights granted to we that my Main Spirit Guides indicated from the Original Creator, the Good and the Authorities that my Main Spirit Guides listed for this sentence. But the Baseline Quality of Life sure as shit was and it didn&#39;t include getting attacked. Considering I was from the light and I would go back to the light when I passed on, as well as the kind of support decent from the good authorities that protected me especially with vindication of information protecting them, lead me to believe and feel that the light had the leeway to intervene in my defense. I was from the Natural Original Setting State but I was also from the Light just as I was from Earth. I didn&#39;t want certain kind to take my words out of context in immoral ways. I knew there was more good light than bad. <br><br>The kinds of interaction around me this day and even late last night especially upon the gearing up before hand had let me know that certain gig and jig was up. Something had changed. Certain kind of vagabonds that would hang around me trying to set interaction in krumb ways were now located at lower levels as to not have certain interaction be a problem. It was a hopefully and I knew it wasn&#39;t fully as that former relayed but it was getting close to that. Feeling large amount of scripts in regards to certain things, hit a marker which didn&#39;t necessarily mean bad in the kind work the good had done to vindicate. There was a spiritual right when some of the events regarding this unfolding that had been shaken and maneuvered in certain manners holding it down for a drive to continue writing. There was another scene where a certain clear silver had got hit partially from my actions in what seemed to be and something situated. I had called out though the real truth that had been the manipulation in tell through word and perception that it might have been manipulated in certain manners as to have been the bad guy or even brought questionings as to whether good or bad. I am not saying it wasn&#39;t more than that because it might have been. There was an area beforehand where it was smooth and a certaink ind mediation streamline was supposedly happening and there was that theory that somehow some were living their lives as a mediation unfolded, it was told that was less of the theory these days, I had talked about 3 looks as to how I proceed in regards to facilitation of ways of life specific to a certain kind of <br><br>Spiritually I was shown something in which I felt thematics and notes throughout my life regarding similar themes having to do something bad. I felt a certain kind of drive and will impacted. It scared me in the kind of thing certain kind were trying to continue to tell me that I wouldn&#39;t fully accept. I looked at something in which I had spoken of before having to do with the fact that I have chosen for the Original Creator and the Good that my Main Spirit Guides indicated to instantly transport me as well as others already specified the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br><br>#Escalation #Delibrate #SmokeAndMirrors #TheKindsOfThingsThatHappenedThough #LargePresenceOfGood #MediationStrreamline #TimeInterplay #OriginalSetting #Light #Physical #KingsOfThePast #WillToLive #NotBrokenSpirit #AlthoughSeemsToBe #AlternativesToUtilizingPhysicalsForWork #RealAlternatives #ThoseThatWontAbidePointReasoningForOnTheChoppingBlock #QUickFlashInstantSaving #InstantInstantaneous #Situated #GoodFormingUp #UnderstandingStance #UnderstandingOurStances  #It&#39;sNotJustARuse #It&#39;sNotJustActing #WeChoose #WhatOurMainSpiritGuidesIndicated #ForUsToChoose #Intelectual #Interaction #Vindication </div>
