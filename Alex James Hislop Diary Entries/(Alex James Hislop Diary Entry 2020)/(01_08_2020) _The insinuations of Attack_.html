<div class="title">(01/08/2020) &quot;The insinuations of Attack&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Quote:<br><br>Activity: <br>I can feel a certain kind of spirit still staying to hold on to this process and depending on how they go about it, it could end up doing more damage than not. I have noticed things change in this place, in my life and in my process. I have felt cleaner energies, I have felt myself be located in different areas that have seemingly been more safe. In the mix though has been multiple kinds of spirit, on one hand one trying to say and potentially have happen that those safe interaction areas are getting attacked spiritually. Another spirit trying to let know that those interaction areas area times masking certain conflict and turbulence taking place. <br><br>- (There was a group of spirits and Gods that emerged in my living room around me and there was a strange silence about it but it seemed to be ok and kosher in a certain manner as to what was taking place at least i what portrayed in the energies and channel. )<br>- ( I felt another kind of spirit later on harass and harangue upon me trying to go to bed. I woke up and decided to read a bit. Then tried to get back to bed. Certain spirit trying to invoke argumentatives and conversation as well as talking about big lines in which it looked to be partially a peak into some of the interaction that has been taking place in certain areas. They had been insinuating all day that somehow I was under attack spiritually but I am not certain if that&#39;s the case and to be honest I feel it might have been an aspect trying to hang on to this process in a certain manner. Spirit have been playing this place at times without knowing or understanding some of the events that have taken place. I kind of felt like there was a true aspect of myself under attack spiritually but I am wondering at what point has that been happening anyhow for a portion of it within the past eight days, what is the truth on this and how does it merit understanding in the ways that my Main Spriit Guides indicated, I don&#39;t want to continue to talk about myself and my defense in a certain context and I would like to speak on others subjects but when it comes back around and the interaction reflects these things, how I am I suppose to stay positive or work on other subjects? If I get attacked spiritually and write it down as a relaying, it shouldn&#39;t snowball and exacerbate interaction. It shouldn&#39;t cause other peoples defensives to be put in jeopardy in which I feel at times has been insinuated.) <br>- ( Some were saying some of the event relaying and the attack were just a joke or some sort elaborate prank. For a portion I think that might be true. But I have felt spiritual and psychic stimuli in which tell me that I am getting attacked at times. If the channel reflects something that is happening n a certain manner and lamented upon others as well that something is taking place it sometimes lends validity and credence in regards to some of the things espoused specifically with some of the history in this process to be true. Two people and processes brought up in a certain manner in which was said to have been vindicated. Large higher up energies and shaping upon some of these people have made me feel that something had been situated and talked about. )<br>- (Some have been trying to create certain lines about me being angry with God to a certain extent. Trying to create certain reasonings why some of us cant be in certain areas or why certain stealing is taking place in which is complete hogwash especially when you flip perspectives in thinking of it in regards to yourselves but factor in quality of life and you start to get the understanding on either side.)<br>- (Baselines were spoken about in this process and spiritual stealing defensives to continue to do a worse job in the context of some not wanting certain defensives to get better but also those lines talked about it in a certain context of certain kind trying to make people and spirit fail to garner more defensive resources. Another so said had and prompting from myself had been to vindicate my Main Spirit Guides in which I feel there was a portion in which had been vindicated.) <br>- There was also a deployment of certain kinds of information around me in my living room in which spoke of certain defensives information and another topic of discussion was that in which spoke about rooms and the interaction between the rooms of this house)<br>- (I had discerned a certain kind of rape impression in which on my end has been labelled as a white glowing energy in which some had said was God being attacked in a certain moment.)<br>- (Another big topic warranting of discussion had been the utilization of Dimensional overlap deployment in regards to certain life and endeavors in which has been utilized and taken advantage in certain manners. I have discerned certain dimensional overlaps to be utilized in decent manners but at times I have also noted indecent utilization and exploitation in regards to certain dimensional overlaps.)<br>- (There were also big events streamlined days previous which I am wondering what the impact on today was in a certain context as well) <br>- ( Another topic discerned in the mix in a subtle fashion is that in which speaks about certain kind of spirits that attack and then take a certain line of defense and community service by taking the hit in regards to certain defensives in which then claiming that somehow they own a portion of the life. Even those in which take a portion of the hit in regards to certain life and claiming they own a portion by way of defense doesn&#39;t fly with my in the ways that my Main Spriit Guides indicated, there is a difference between those sanctioned to have a portion of my life by my main Spriit Guides and there is a difference between that in which is not sanctioned. There is unofficial ones that my Main Spirit Guides point towards in the capacities that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light.)<br><br>Daily Mantra:<br>#Positive #Care #Compassion #Kindness #Happiness #Wonder #Magic #Brilliant #Fantastic #Charming #Classic #Creative #Courageous #Chivalry #Cool #Clean #Cheery #Beautiful #Dazzling #Divine #Effective #Elegant #Ecstatic #Electrifying #Energetic #Ethical #Exquisite #Efficient #Fair #Fabulous #Free #Friendly #Funny #Healing #Honest #Heavenly #Ideal #Imaginative #Independent #Innovative #Instantaneous #Intuitive #Inventive #Jovial #Jubilant #Joy #Legendary #Lucid #Lucky #Lovely #Light #Lively #Marvelous #Meaningful #Merit #Miraculous #Natural #Novel #Nice #Nurturing #Phenomenal #Paradise #Resources #Supplies #Amenities #Support #Pretty #Prominent #Proud #Perfect #Progress #Prosperity #Protected #Truth #Honesty #Poised #Quiet #Quality #Quick #Refined #Reassuring #Robust #Rewarding #Restored #Resounding #Reliable #Remarkable #Respected #Reward #Reasonings #Rejoice #Right #Left  #Skillful #Sunny $Success #Spiritual #Stunning #Special #Soulful #Simple #Secure #Safe #Super #Stupendous #Spirited #Sparkling #Smiles #Rainbows #Gold #Stars #Whimsical #Tranquil #Terrific #Thrilling #Tops #Transformative  #Thriving #Trusting #Valued #Victorious #Wealthy #Sponsors #Elite #Worthy #Vital #Vigorous #Willing #Wow #Restored #Love #Armor #Choice #Consent #SubjectMatterSafety<br><br>#ThoseThatHaveDefendedMePastMySafeZonesFromUpAbove #ThoseThatAreDone #LosingHoldsOnThisProcess #Cleaners #SubjectChanging #BigLines #Conversations #ProxiesVindicated #ThosThatTakeTheHit</div>
