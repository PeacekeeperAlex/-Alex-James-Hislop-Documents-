<div class="title">(21/08/2020)</div>
<div class="content">Smooth and calming energies in the morning on my end. Although there was a let know regarding that there might be turbulence outside certain areas. I remembered the soothsaying from yesterday, really spoke of some of the storylines that have been unfolding at times especially regarding Nature and Creation but this time in sync with what I had been noting yesterday having to do with Creation and Nature working together in which is more acceptable in certain societies, I think Earth-Based might be one of them. Not only that but within certain culture there being creeds in protecting eachother regarding certain Concepts. We have seen the Son storyline and the Sun storyline and I do feel it&#39;s been a bit of a focus at times. The revelation that by way of choosing love can mean choosing family and friends not just loving energies or those you have intimate relationships with but can include platonic love inclusion of Mothers and Fathers, Sons and Daughters and a wide range of other kinds of relationships. There was these scenes in my process at times where some were trying to depict that Love and Sons storyline in clash but really I think it was less so. It might have been the Sons that pointed this out for some of them and the Concept. Maybe it was the other relationships of Mother, Father and Daughter as well as the other kinds that made some of the me feel that way and of all four they might understand most of what was explained regarding Love in what it can pertain towards. Another noting though is relationships that have less to do with love in other cultures and within certain situations there is specific choices, I am not saying there isn&#39;t because there is but I looked at it from a certain perspective that said love can encapsulate many things expanded beyond that in which Romantic relationships sometimes remind. It doesn&#39;t denote the many that would choose their own, not just portions but at what point does that choice become limited and what are the alleviation for such need for remedy. A certain kind of spiritual has been coming around me. An older kind to be true, one in which might be many times older than what some think and not necessarily in regards to literal age for some but rather remembrance and understanding of the situations. In the mix has been another kind trying to limit true anti-camp decent measures on my end but I think this one is different. Choices like protecting ones own family in certain instances let known to be a clear choice and a normal one at that that has been explained at length in this process. There was moments yesterday where it felt like choices were made and I needed to leave certain areas and/or certain spiritual needed to leave my space and area in proximity as well as other kinds. I was saddened because I knew there was some that are supposed to be moving upwards and I know some are supposed to be in this process but the amount taking advantage and the kind of antics seen not a day later from of the Authority discussions upset but a working through kinks is what was said. Still there was this feeling of wanting to record gaming content intermingled with wanting to watch a movie. It was a recreational day at least on my end physically for certain aspects of myself. I think it&#39;s starting to be understood the kind of direction that some want to go. There kind of version of Anti-Camp decent for some and on my end I looked at some of the ones working from up top downwards and I remembered there is that kind of spiritual, a large amount, some of which in interaction with this space and some of the planets, a portion of which natural. The coexistence question is interesting because there is those not working from that angle in certain sense and how would it be that both those kinds of groups manage interaction with eachother and with others choosing either direction in certain proximities close to one another makes that question of vitality in a certain sense. The understanding that Earth-Based is of many and multiple cultures doesn&#39;t denote that it can&#39;t form up and yesterday on my end there was discussions of forming up in certain senses. Is this a Red Haring? I knew that there were those that proceed in fashions that most on this planet earth physically would find in their physical lives to past what they find acceptable and I knew that even given certain circumstances and variables understood that some of them would still have difficulty accepting. I feel I know the kinds of Anti-Camp decent variables that this planet is looking for spiritually by way of what my Main Spirit Guides and the Spiritual Guideships that my Main Spirit Guides indicated discerned. I feel that not all of them want to have anything to do with that kind of style too, I don&#39;t think it should be a problem because the real true and partial revelation is that there is good good on this planet that don&#39;t go anti-camp decent routes and shouldn&#39;t be aggravated for such ways of operating but that there was also those that have been Anti-Camp decent as well. It&#39;s not just an emergence that happened with me speaking on content and to the spirit regarding but rather something in which has existed for a while now. At what point cross line? As I would learn there is different thresholds regarding Anti-Camp decent and things of that nature, also other kinds decent. At what point though does what need to be understood for what this planet and culture hold to be true. Yesterday there was moments where it looked like some were letting know that there was certain Earth-Based Authorities cut off from certain areas in which needed movement and communication. This might be smoke and mirrors. <br><br>The dry supposedly coming around or a certain culture regarding. Has reminded of earlier times to be true specifically during 2018. Reminds of a certain kind of Audience dig regarding the simplistic jabs upon some of baselines upon Rights Activism down here. Reminds similarly of another work room culture too. That there is dimensional setup in which eventually goes dry again to be refilled with the resources needed exists in certain areas. Some don&#39;t operate as such but others do. They also remind me of realism, some of those staying behind in certain moments that still need resources. There seems to be something about resources but there always seems to be. Like a decision to be made though or in certain areas a decision to be revealed. There is a certain dry that like trickle and stream but others that would rather lump sum to be true. <br><br>Earth-Based Authority that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and Earth-Based updates let known multiple times throughout the day that Earth-Based has received resources spiritually and in other-dimensional. I have continued to feel a certain presence, and other kinds throughout the day of the past. Let knows about some that have been in this process in decent manner is what I discerned. <br><br>Another tell today has been retrieval in regards to certain aspects of spiritual especially upon certain physicals passing on and Spiritual being left behind. Retrieval regarding supposedly today. I felt military presence upon me researching physical firearms. Did some advocations on the Veterans board as well as other Boards as well but also the (AJHD) Earth-Based Military disclaimers and (AJHD) Earth-Based Non-Authority disclaimers as well as. <br><br>There was this subtle silent and distancing from certain this day but also these days maybe. I am not certain what the recourse but the United Nations I think are going the correct direction but I am worried about the slipping through the cracks. I know there are good spiritual and spiritual that have been through and I am really hoping for Remedy. It&#39;s not just about Earth-Based, it never was for some of it but I feel there is good Authorities and peoples, spiritual and other-dimensional that are figuring it out. You can see some of the Changes and it&#39;s been done in stellar fashion at times regardless of some of the experiences that some think I have garnered. I have seen this evolution take place in my process and it is being done so in logical fashion for a large portion if not all of it but that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t compassion, it also doesn&#39;t mean that the hit is a certain kind of acceptable. I can only do so much and the distancing today again I felt needed but for some other spirit not so. At what point does saving not take precedence and at what point does the balance maintain especially regardless. <br><br>Something flipped on my end in regards to life sustenance energies regarding family where I feel like I am not getting what I need without having family presence within vicinity. I am wondering. I don&#39;t know why it has to be such as t o what some have tried to make it here. It needs to be understood that having family in vicinity is not the problem that some are labeling, it doesn&#39;t mean that there isn&#39;t supposed to be ways to proceed regarding Family in keeping them safe. What needs to be understood is that on this Planet Physically and Spiritually, Family is an important one. The understanding that when some choose love, that they are also choosing family. Love can be a part of Family just as Family can be a part of Love.<br><br>Writing and hints of that story spindle making it&#39;s presence be known by way of the sadness upon the regularities of life at times and sometimes this aint no regularity. The power of sadness yesterday seen on my lawn was a kind that scared me. Literally where spiritual trying to calm me down so I didn&#39;t do damage to some. I cry at times, I would want cry regarding but I can&#39;t at times. The suppression regarding sadness has been ill placed at times, but maybe there was more of a reason than some thought and it makes despair in regards to the unfair of some of the economics of emotion entangled with some of the unfair of the situation. The sadness could be used to heal. The sadness could heal itself for some by way of being able to be sad.<br><br>There was tense at times this day. I wondered about the early morning tell that some wanted me to write here and I didn&#39;t want to believe it but I also to believe that the previous nights were worse either. Talk about crossroads in the past.<br></div>
