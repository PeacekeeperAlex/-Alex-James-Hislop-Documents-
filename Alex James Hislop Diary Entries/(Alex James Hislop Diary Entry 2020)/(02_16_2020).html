<div class="title">(02/16/2020)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>Dream: The barman from lord of the rings scene, where he was scared after searching for someone. Horseman from the wild hunt kind of vision. Severed head in which when looked towards had what some did not want to see off kilter. So said to be the dark in which then the dark left and it was actually the good bad left holding the bag but it might not have been the dark to be true but rather someone trying to set them up. kind of reminded of death eater stuff but got foiled quickly and known to be for what it was. There was an insinuation that it was good-bad setting up good that were labelled good bad. After the above I put some awareness in regards to certain things, I put the media on and did SEO as put CNN on and a certain kind of happening in this process, again the rounds of trying to make it seem like certain peoples that are not at fault seem to be the reasoning for certain bad things happening. I went to sleep. Kind of reminded <br><br>Dream: About a certain kind of spirit working against me, it looked to be a certain musician and actress archetype. One in which some are trying to say is bad but is actually good. Within the dream itself I remembered experiencing pain and suffering from psychological. Like extreme pain in head area in which some spirit wanted me to label on fire psychologically maybe to let now that I have experienced ones like that and that others have experienced things like that. Trying to insinuate certain physicals are of a group potentially thousands in which emerged having to do with bad spirit working against in which there is a portion of them that just want to live their lives and don&#39;t believe that they are the bad ones. <br><br>My dreams should be about what my Main Spirit Guides indicated not about what route the bad spirit pretending to be good are going. <br><br>One of the key points in regards to all of this is ripple affect and how certain kind in the past borrowed from other moments to extend a certain kind of presence as ell as the amount of positively and morality that has prompted and prompted in vicinity. I woke up and felt there to be psychological infrastructure around in which I was shifted to a new spot inwards from the damage. I was not affected in regards to live dimensional supposedly but spiritual psychologists might disagree. Either way some are trying to affect , manipulate and influence behind the screens for something in which has been caught already when it happens in the moment and considered to be for what it is. They wanted to use such things partially to employ a certain kind of truth telling serum in regards to myself behind the scenes again in which was already played out weeks ago. Some want to utilize the psychological as the reasoning. They also wanted to utilize this as a reasoning to say somehow I am crazier than I seem in which there is already a large portion of the spirit that understand what is happening in this process. <br><br>Office room got slammed in a certain manner not really for a portion of them, maybe more than not having to do with some of the events taking place. I am wondering if there is places in the world that got hit not really a part of some of the things understood within the portion of the spirit that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>I decided to put Earth-Based disclaimers and family disclaimers on my computer screen next to live coverage of Earth from space. There has been this thing about watching live coverage of Earth, a visual especially when doing energy placement in regards to Earth. This was after riding a high of an Alex James Hislop Diary Entry Content in which I read the (AJHD) Earth-Based Authorities disclaimers in physical Earth-Based online digital. I followed it up by going for a walk into town which there was this really cool synergy with listening to music. A moment where prompting good in regards to a certain spiritual group, some of which colossalank which turned into a wild ride of transportation repair when I took a bus for Newmarket. There was at the same time that spiritual in my office for a portion healing earth. On the way there has been movement of more in from of the scenes perspective twisting and turning almost like getting dragged off but I feel they were protected. <br><br>I felt sadness and loneliness even though the spirit was around me in a huge way. I felt more human that I had been previous in ways in which reminded of innocence and kindness, who I am had been more revealed when I had been in Newmarket this day but doesn&#39;t negate the things I have said and done in the past partially by way of life utilization difficulties and stealing. I recorded my content, I had my discussions and what I said in the physical throughout my life as Alex James Hislop born November 22nd, 1991. I have said in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and it&#39;s not to say spirit didn&#39;t say it with me and in different ways. There were certain moments in new market where it felt a fame extension and movement of dimensions were around me. Potentially in part by way of the 92nd Academy Awards watched in which I could again feel riffing from certain spirit. A movement of large dimensional touched down where I used to work and some said it was where story Brook began but to be true I think it might have been near trees.<br><br>An other dimensional change that had occured yesterday, less awareness on my end, energy discernment emphasis on the physical. Certain spiritual in the sky and weather, higher up and I discern to be in regards to setting dimensional as well at times. Like the spiritual that IH lave been able to sense at times is either more in the ground or higher up. There are still certain energy discernments in regards to impressional regarding signs and decals as well as things similar but definitely more dimensional inwards in regards to physicals. Energies from the sky and weather more prominent. Important information.<br><br>Certain kind trying to insinuate that the look sense in regards to myself in other dimensional ahs been affected and change to do different kinds of things upon the utilization of look. It was insinuated at first to have been about interaction in the spirit regarding look especially a certain kind of look but then segwayed to just me looking. <br><br><br>Themes: #Gaming #Travel #Awareness #Updates #Communication #Fame #Film #Music #Love #Promptings #Advocations #Soldiers  #Movement #LifeUtilization #Healing #Earth <br></div>
