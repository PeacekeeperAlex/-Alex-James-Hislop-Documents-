<div class="content">Meeting points within this office room and moments of god and Higher up spiritual interacting but also other kinds. It looked like the Good had looked at multiple angles this process and others , I could feel fixes happening and remedies not only in regards to myself but there was also subtle line that potentially other as well as done in a contained manner inside the room. There was dimensional conversation about dimensional moving. There was this direction talked and it seems to facilitate and get by regarding why certain dimensional placement happened on this planet. We looked at the reasons why some said to have placed certain dimensional in regards to my life and there is a certain kind of merit but also not so in certain manners. Some of the bad stuff talked about coupled with other variables was not sufficient reasoning for what was seen for what I have done within my physical life and the fact that I have talked about other selves and allpersonal in the manipulation and influencing that has happened should make it plain that what the kind of things that have happened in other dimensional regarding myself should matter and that further creation of reasonings as to why myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides are to blame is being noted prominently and there is stellar defense regarding. <br><br>Felt like some were trying to go a certain direction regarding travel not necessarily the bad guys but rather something else. <br><br>Certain landing pad physical impressional on head area that has been noted before to impact other dimensional psychological. On my end I discerned certain spiritual at times let know of certain spiritual interactions unclouth upon what I am choosing and how I am operating in other-dimensional and today there seem to be something told that certain spiritual are working through some of the kinks regarding past timesframes. It was said to be that certain spiritual see happenings within their dimensional. Th<br>Some of the happenings seem to be partially based upon resources being garnered for art on this planet earth. <br><br>I have felt off these days since yesterday. A part of me is being suppressed but another aspect seems to be in the thick of some of the things taking place. I don&#39;t know what exactly dimensional movement took place but there seems to be another point where goodbyes and not reallys evident upon the interaction. It&#39;s like I feel uneasy. Scared. <br><br>A certain kind of good arrived but with certain spiritual. Some trying to clean up memories that were viewed yesterday having to do with whatever the hell happened. Contrasting with yesterday which looked at times to be <br><br>Something happened regarding personal yesterday said to be some sort of emergence either yesterday or today. There was guardians of personal and love as well as certain personnel regarding<br><br>Those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated regarding that I refer to when regarding when I am sometimes talking towards certain vent area spiritual and other kinds. <br><br>Supposedly setting up this process interaction to be interacting with certain light existences upon interaction unless it be another kind dimensional but I feel there are multiple to be true in interaction technically speaking and that <br><br>bloods about love crips about banners. I had wondered the kind of meaning and had seen symbolism regarding through colour. The power of blood has been noted at times and there seems to be powerful majic regarding. I also see the Alliance blue at times upon the colour crips. I feel though what shouldn&#39;t be lost is the what it meant to those of the gangs it represented. There was a song one that reminds me of what I feel it might have meant to some. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r2ySEWeU5o<br><br>Great vibes during some play of music turning a bit of downer day when I had felt certain inner knowing infrastructure updates that seemed to slack jaw my direction but also change certain personality and behavior to the point of subtle depression. It was like something was known and it kind of turned into me not really wanting to do much of anything today to be honest. It wasn&#39;t the heightened of yesterday. Some trying to label the dimensional traversed towards which seemed to be good area albeit with contained red flags in which the process went beautifully for the most part although I don&#39;t fully know if some of the spiritual back and fourth created some eye brows raised and if more than that it should be understood discretely. <br><br>There was some powerful good around this day. I discerned movement at one point where they came around, hectic a bit, gathering bearings out the gate of some sort of entrance area to the process, multiple groupings at once, discerned good in the mix and did get bearings enough to understand a few of the situations. One in which had to do with this process direction in which interesting that the monotone deadpan and lack of luster for life energies at times in which had been discerned the night previous to be terrible feeling, almost as if there is an energy, similar to life force in which has been discerned at times although in different manner sustenance for certain kinds of living on this planet. It&#39;s distressing because I have felt these energies and if it isn&#39;t how I am feeling them and rather something else as has been uncovered as has been felt than it is scary especially given the strength that the spiritual through me can feel. It seemed <br><br>Regular energies within life on earth-based and some of the spiritual regarding. one of the groups around today.<br><br>Antics and small dimensional upheaval with machinisms of spiritual maneuvering to different infrastructure. Some of this is not normal and to the degree it has been happening is not ok for me. At a certain point I felt maybe it was just too far but it wasn&#39;t today to be truth but rather within the past year or two and 2015 being forgotten for the kind of stuff pulled on that year in this process might have trumped too be true for incredulity of scenes playing out at times. As well as the amount of spiritual involved. I would sense different cultures during that year in which I would reemerge during later timeframes every so often with many kinds in the mix. <br><br>The problematic of certain spiritual only seeing certain aspects of this process has been seen but it remains illusive whether or not it is for the better or worse. At times regarding understanding of channel albeit situated at times has been problematic and it&#39;s interesting to have happened upon some of the events talked about regarding<br><br>Dimensional movement of certain infrastructure yet again in being able to feel stimuli regarding in many ways, springing motions upwards, thrown spiritual machinisms.<br><br>One of the other topics that has been is the monitoring of what I am experiencing by others experiencing my life.<br><br>Shoehorning Earth-Based in regards to the category of Physical Earth-Based especially upon interaction rules of the road. Seems to have been with the emphasis coming out of this process at times. <br><br>Something going on with memories as well.<br><br>Some of the spiritual that take over for me in working on my life as well as other kinds for a certain portion especially those in front of the scenes.<br><br>Music making certain physicals feel a part of something.<br><br><br>Advocationals:<br>Storybrook disclaimer possibilities at least to provide safety and the date of creation will be on there.<br>The spiritual within the voice works. defense adaptations possibly<br></div>
