<div class="title">(19/11/2020) &quot;Real Cool&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>This kind of realism brown knocked at my door in the early morning in which looked like they were to say something, like scrapping for parts, they reminded of certain kinds of mech areas as well as Artificial Intelligence. The Blade Runner synergy to be true, but it wasn&#39;t the only kind of thing noted. There is multiple different kinds of realism noted but there is also multiple kinds of connotation regarding, not just a mech and advanced technology interplay. What was this group about in the kind of good they promoted?<br><br>I had wondered when those interaction systems that were crafted in the second and third age would make it through already, especially that in which is just sitting on the side. It&#39;s a shoutout to yesterday when it was understood of confrontation via words in that we that my Main Spirit Guides indicated have been granted the rights from the Original Creator that he indicated in regards to this writing in which didn&#39;t include getting attacked. It wasn&#39;t just ignoring communication from the light but also ignoring the fact of resources that were piled high on the side. Imagine getting attacked for resources one didn&#39;t want upon them while the resources they did want sitting in some area not too far by. There had been a misunderstanding and lens that made no sense, it wasn&#39;t going the normal routes of baseline quality of life that was the reason for turbulence. It was something else that was the problem. I shouldn&#39;t have to speak up and say that I am choosing quality of life interactions and atmospherics especially the kinds that can facilitate multiple cultural in the kinds of violent video games manifested to stave as alternative to real violence and the kind they had in gaming fashion could look just as real without anyone getting harmed. Since certain kind were already supposed to have the quality of life understood, we could look at it like certain vagabond attacking had less to do with choosing quality of life but there those that approached it differently that supposedly was a big enough to deal to not be provided the quality of life that was already granted by higher spiritual. Having good quality of life behind the scenes spiritually was a normality and was talking about the same thing as having good quality of life at level. Because someones behind the scenes was another at level. Where was the defense from certain actions attachment as well as tethering in regards to going justified and regular routes in attaining quality of life seemed prudent and decent to write down here given realistic purposes but the way some viewed seemed to be lending credence to a morality type that deserved credence in operating with stops and flows upon moral meaning. Now I dare not think of what would happen if that moral type had been told lies upon when to stop as well as when to flow. I do know that there was another type though that I was of even if I too was of that moral type in certain capacities. In some trying to get some to believe that they needed to be granted quality of life rather than that quality of life already granted, there had been a certain kind of thing happen in middle capacity between that somehow said warranting of immoral action in which was wrong on multiple counts. That somehow when one goes the route of actually facilitating and being facilitated of good life that that meant something that wasn&#39;t true n capacities that were unacceptable and partial reasoning as to why more support for the save most if not all emergence seemed to be more thriving than it already was regardless. I was from that culture that believed in many, if not most, if not all being saved, regardless of whether they chose as such. If everyone believed as such than what was the problem. It was that kind of many are good grouped up in believing in something that realistically because supposedly higher direction didn&#39;t reflect what needed that realistic choices in front of the scenes needed to be made but realism also dictated that it was in front of the scenes that could save many, if not most as well as too and that moment of so many good agreeing gets a real cool hand. <br><br>The walk this day felt to be related to that day having to do with maneuvering of knowing and knowledge infrastructures for what I could discern to be happening. This time kind of felt to be a certain kind of distraction but I kind of feel that the movement of dimensional be too large to be for distraction purposes. There was open air energies emphasized and it felt like there was not many spiritual on the street kind of feeling but understanding what is overlapping physical for a portion decent for what I am viewing but still important to understand that there was clear street on one of the areas i was sensing as a psychic medium even though understood that there was other dimensional and spiritual in movement and non-movement overlapping what i was viewing physically.<br><br>Societal clouth types freaking out supposedly this day but it&#39;s not the real truth I feel. I had a tell earlier about it but I didn&#39;t fully know what it meant. What the hell was happening out there on earth based when whatever the hell happened on my end? A line of awareness making it through to earth-based as well as connection and convergence. Unity taking place and maybe a note of anxiety regarding organizational. Vindication from some regarding utilization of societal types. What were they pining about? Did certain kind fall off the wagon?<br><br>There was another note of certain kind slandering my family. Not sure what it meant. Again insinuations of certain kinds of things unsavoury and there had been this focal having to do with other dimensional and spiritual at times but an ignoring variable if it had to do with me.<br><br>What the heck was why certain good came around me after reading a chapter in it<br><br>Who should be more powerful, light being or a physical being? I had at times in certain mock debates sided with physical on opposite side of what one believes in kind of way depending on what kind of physical, I am a physical down here and would want <br>Mock debates and real debates, what is the difference?<br><br>What is the difference between caring about ones personal, especially work and power level compared to another that cares about their personal in which is supposedly getting in the way of defense? <br><br>Another psychic attack via headaches but it might have been a good thing in the kind of realization of what headaches and migraines are doing in the kind of protecting the body kind of way but I am wondering if the smalls and other dimensional are safe regarding, it reminded of eating mustard saving the body like some average joe medical. There was cranium pressure at one point and it felt like certain duress but at a certain point it seemed like quick situating regarding and it got to a point where the questions for some after the fact was the kind of specialists over here as well as in others and the use regarding. I think there was some farther away able to traverse to this process quickly for some but others not so. <br><br>Appreciation in regards to freedom of the press within moral framework naturally understood. To be able to write appreciation regarding.<br><br>That within casettes there might be communication through skips and boops. I have felt audio levels become impacted, like low modifier voice stuff. We had seen paranormal in regards to music, quick feng shui regarding as well. When for some did paranormal become some side job upon being saved.<br><br>Remembrance day, the kinds of things that were done in regards to this life. <br><br>Themes:<br>#MechCulture #BladeRunner #RealismDiscussions #Converse #GuardiansOfTheGalaxy #GoodReasonings #WrongReasonings #Intimacy #WorkedOut #PhysicalMonetariesDiscussionWalk #ManeuveringDimensional #Blame #Emaulb #SavingTheBullHeaded #SelfInterestsMotivated #TheDifferenceBetweenMoralityAndPragmatism #Balancing #Self #Non-Self #Identity #Stash #Searching #TreasureMaps #GamesOfOrientation #PsychicSupression #CommunitySupression #SafeThough #RightConflict #LessOfAnInternalStruggle #RealConflictsHavingToDoWithMoralityTypes #DoneWithCertainTypes #MyMorality #WhoDidIChooseToBeInMySpiritualInteraction #WhyTheFocusOnRiCurrently? #EnergySituated #Energy #LovingTheEnergiesToday #RealityOfRealism  #StickToThePlanWhichDoesIncludeRealisticChoicesInFrontOfTheScenes</div>
