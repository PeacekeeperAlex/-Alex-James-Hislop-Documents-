<div class="title">(26/07/2020)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>Talk of the past. <br><br>The thoughts of being a gangster. I looked at a moment of an archetype. Reminds of The Game. The things I had experienced or that they said that I experienced made me look around, I saw gangsters on corners protecting neighborhoods. At what point do you see some spiritual move through trying to attack until you finally realize that they might not be the bad guys and understand that they aren&#39;t always the good guys. Maybe that&#39;s the point in a shout out to banner culture way in what they recognize to be. Where the Good vs Bad is more grey than the smoke blown in those rooms of operation. <br><br>The realization that many of this style of play can actually be good and have less to do with Good. Has to do with their own. Safety and quality of life provided and still holding it down for being tough. Some might find the latter to be strange upon my explanation but ways of life regarding to be important upon the noting. This partially made me see Anti-Camp in a certain light in which already existed but provided context to some of the culture that exists especially upon following societal style. It was just this line of morality upon myself that made me feel that I am not a Gangster and to be true in my physical life and the live regarding I am not that but spiritually and dimensionally I asked myself at what point do I not care about being that especially if it&#39;s because I feel that I am not one of those strong gangster types, that I don&#39;t have the street cred and that I am middle aged white dude still living with his parents. Nonetheless the breaking bad look of it all kind of made me feel that that route is not only viable but valid and justified. Did it look that way anyhow at times was another observation. <br><br>I know myself. I am one of that kind of spiritual of some of the spiritual that those physical spiritualists talk about, Enlightenment and Love, but the truth is that many physicals on this physical planet are of that too in a certain style. So when I thought of being in some other dimensional selve as an other self living that life while I live my physical life brought me back to reality at the beginning of the month. It was one of those epiphanies that said that somehow if I was trying to protect my home and my own, that I might look at situations that if I turned into something different whether it be Bannerman or gangster, that it wouldn&#39;t be too out of context and is not necessarily a bad thing given emphasis of Love and Self Defense of myself and my own as well as others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated because I am one of those kinds of spiritual that does try to save and does care. I only go so far though. I don&#39;t feel that&#39;s a bad thing but sometimes it can feel that way. <br><br>Spoke about different historicals. Japan and the personal seen at times but also the business culture in the elders and the youth culture that is getting older now that reminds of positivity and eccentricity but also an outlandish acceptance that I always identified with gratitude and something North American Culture at times has not provided at times. Someone who does something different seemingly made fun of easier in North American Culture. Like staying at home with your parents past due not necessarily considered to be a bad thing to degrees seen through certain pop culture or coming out with fashion and Art that is vibrant to degrees in which even accents Asian Culture. I thought about the British and where American Culture come from and they can seem grey at times in which I wondered if had to do with the perception comparison of acceptance and culture specifically having to do with bright expression. Earl Grey good sir but the English also remind of a specific with Modern in youth culture and Elder Legal Culture. There is also the normal folk which remind of my Fathers generation born in the 50s and 60s. It&#39;s interesting to look upon National and the Cultural difference but also some of the messages and meanings. <br><br>One of the discussions that happened after had maneuvered to different kinds of film culture and the discussions pertaining in the kinds of revelation seen throughout film but also the safety regarding in being able to do such things with filmaking. A scene reflecting concepts seen within spiritual culture, spiritual culture consulted beforehand and you might see a reveal on screen of that culture within the context of the film and the Artist&#39;s Vision. Some of it was said to be accidental for some of the scenes of the films that emerged on this planet. Vampires in the spiritual consulted upon Vampiric depictions. There are many different kinds of things regarding movies like that in certain manners but there are movies as well that go different paths, still the depictions seen within film and the understanding that there is spiritual and other-dimensional areas that house some of the Species depicted within film is still not fully understood physically on Earth. Some of the depictions within film might have lend towards portions of creation of such but there is a chance that it existed before as well as. Filmmakers try to care about the sensitivity of such nature but they are also creating story and art and for many of them are of Entertainment in a certain context and it doesn&#39;t mean there hasn&#39;t been compromise through certain productions regarding depictions of certain species and culture that exist spiritually behind the scenes. <br><br>Genghis Khan spoken about again within this process as he has been brought up before here and there. I did an advocation for his Main Spirit Guideship information to be seen as the importance of such a figure on this planet is important. There has been advocations I have done in regards to Earth-Based Historicals and given the context of how my life has played out and some of the informational discernment from my psychictivity given situations, the thought that it might be the better of it remains and I feel Earth-Based Authorities that my Main Spriit Guides indicated do monitor such actions from myself and that they do sanction advocations from myself regarding certain Historicals of Earth-Based Past. <br><br>Something fixed and figured out in regards to my communication, expanded communication in regards to what I talk. Another way to play it seen to be good alternative and when timing strikes happens to be about when I don&#39;t talk about subject wanting to be talked about or was going to be talked about being spoken of spiritually and explained in even better fashion. <br><br>Another discussion had been about whether I would Emerge or not but actually being connected to life path direction in the past regarding physical humans and other kinds that would have a different life path for some of them if I was to incarnate regarding my current as well as generational that my Main Spirit Guides relayed for some of them. One of the points as to why some of the past looks different than what it might should have been upon my emergence and others that my Main Spirit Guides relayed having to do with future discernment and present frameworks set for the future in that if that a certain spiritual relied upon in regards to the frameworks being set and the complications it can cause by way of that spiritual does not incarnate in. Of course there might have been a decent amount of frameworks put into play regarding my emergence and the emergence certain generational * Expand put fourth gravity in regards process and informational placement explaining. Then again not all operate in a certain capacity pertaining to if certain kind emerge in the future and I feel we have a certain kind upon some of us these days in which is giving leeway, we are lucky in how some have helped Earth-Based past upon my emergence and the emergence of others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. <br><br>Near the end of the day movement of dimensional around me where I felt very heightened and placement of dimensional around some of things I came into contact but also happening in a proximity potentially. I felt I was higher up and in some sort of Authority area by way of how some view it. Some were trying to get spiritually to go to this place and I think there was false perception in some saying that it was a certain kind of expensive. I discerned a king. There was a single leaders yesterday during some of the events. My Authorities were brought up earlier in the day and there had been times when I have reflected that single leadership can be beneficial and I saw the end for that upon some of Earth-Based. I did have a conflict when I looked upon that manifest because I didn&#39;t want to disappoint but I still knew I had to go with what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I felt I could go there or at least I think I was supposed to be able to feel that way. <br><br>There was a bit of a blowout at the end of the day. Multiple tells of spiritual under duress but also tells of saving in which made me happy but there was still moments of disgruntled and upsetness in certain direction gone. Had to do with gaming I think but also something else. There was moments where I prompted what my Main Spirit Guides relayed regarding cops and some of things that I had been through.There has been times where I had been screaming not necessarily in argumentative manner for some of it where physicals Cops were called and I did create golden energies overlapping me and upon and the switched to white and it was done with truth impressions, some of it was truth energies and/or supposed to be. I think it was clarified and I think I did make it through to them spiritually and other-dimensionally but there was also a decent amount of healers and reassures regarding some of the interaction yesterday. Spiritual keeping things calm even though there was those needed calming energies. There some haranguing and harassing in this area, in multiple areas almost like a look of moving upwards and some trying to antagonize by way of being upwards. I still discern a large portion to be good. Some were saying Anti-Camps under duress but what I discerned was a cleaning up and refreshing of memory for some of them and also given opportunities to a certain degree, done decent in multiple kinds of manners for some to still remember that they want to be bad in certain manners. (Explain yourself)<br><br>Myself and others that my Main Spriit Guides indicated have seen how some are playing it, letting know that argumentatives, conversation and even upsetting tone of voice is not warranting what some are trying to warrant. We that my Main Spriit Guides indicated still would like this process to reflect calming and reassuring because it can help. It doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t be realistic and it is understood that we still talk about defense and things of that nature but also other topics. With that calm and reassurance, it creates something. It doesn&#39;t we can&#39;t be honest as well especially if under duress. The facilitation regarding Argumentatives, Conversation, Inflection and even other kinds in regards to this process, like life utilization I feel is still being facilitated in regards to this process and other processes and should be recognized as such.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if I got attacked spiritually yesterday but I certainly want the spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides indicated n regards to this writing to check up exactly what my Main Spriit Guides in regards to sentence. <br><br>Expand upon shapings of people in regards to interactions with other people later on. Expand other bodies deployed for updates for a certain spiritual, sight, sense and memory. (EXPAND)<br><br>The hand signs in the room, a storyline moved quick? a storyline brought up? Was it about gaming?<br><br>Try to Write Upon style writings. <br><br>Supposedly certain kind of safeguard catch in regards to some of the informational placement spiritually and other-dimensionally behind the scenes in which looked to have maneuvered a sizable portion of some of the informational placement in which not just the bad was upset about. Mark it down. <br><br>I ended up doing an advocation to cover my work load for July 26th, 2020 but I also did a specific advocation in regards to those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated to write what my Main Spriit Guides relayed to help those that my Main Spriit Guides listed in regards to this sentence. <br><br>ArgumentativesRights<br>OverreactionRights<br>LessOverreaction in regards to this process though. </div>
