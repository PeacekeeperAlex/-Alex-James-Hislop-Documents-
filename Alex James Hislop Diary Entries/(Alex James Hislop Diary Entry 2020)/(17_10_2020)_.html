<div class="title">(17/10/2020) </div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Bird feathers at the end of the road, Stellar Jay and/or Blue Jay, some didn&#39;t me to offend, some didn&#39;t know and some of it had less to do with me or the information I was writing for a portion. It might have bee a natural occurring thing where a cat caught a bird and the fact that that might have been the more interesting specifically for some where it had less to do with the synchronicity but rather the normality gives a tell. I had spoken about birds yesterday on my diary entry page but I thought it might have been informational passed down. There are certain spiritual that don&#39;t know or understand that something might offend, they something nice but how they go about doing it might seem aggressive or terrible but are trying to help, some of which handicap and don&#39;t deserve attack. There are also those using this as an excuse to hide behind. There is all manners of other variables even just looking upon he scenes of single feathers and chunks of feathers at the end of my road in which some of the detectives have been trying to relay this past week along with other kinds of Citizens, Pedestrians and other kinds including army but also darker kinds too not at fault. <br>                                           <br>The quick instantaneous flash saving, those in front of the scenes focusing on the parts that are a certain kind of Janky, with all of the amount of reed tape and how it works, there is pockets that need saving specifically when events taking place and the kind of overblown upon the rumor mill and truth has put spiritual in a tough spot. Saying those old names are choosing what their guideships indicated for them to choose.<br><br>I feel the markings in what I have been noting physically is partially being done by multiple collaborations, one of which is the bigger I feel in a certain capacity even if some say there might be less markings from them in which currently I dont feel that to be the case. The real of it though in what some need to realize is that a lot of it is good. There is a compromise in which exists due to some not wanting to have to battle it out in fashions previous, out of energy, maybe something else, which might have to do with shoring up warfare mediation and how big mend culture can be specifically if there going the same with with different paths that sees a successful mediation. This has less to do with certain mediation being the bad guy. One of the subtle that had less to do with certain things had been about a smoke and mirrors utilization of some of the things happening physically regarding other dimensional and spiritual matters in which I feel both matter because some f the physical changes have reflected spiritual and other dimensional decent but also involves other dimensional and spiritual matters in a certain context. Where when we saw all the kind of utilization and maneuverings from certain kind, going to where it starts for true and if there is a disconnect, remedying the disconnect in certain manner, because the lower downs dealing with it have seen too much pretend and utilization as well as realism regarding multiple kinds of issues, like where one person says that a certain group is actually good but then  certain kind use that as an excuse as well as pointing out that there is good version and different versions regarding, the numbers for some of it are continuing to seem endless for some regarding certain areas which the resources to be used on dealing with manually are unrealistic but I dont see how just leaving them behind is not the unrealistic and it would have been viewed as unrealistic back then to what it is becoming again.<br><br>There was a metaphor regarding the the It storyline, It at times remindes of a mouse but also a Cat, there has been a thing about Cat and Mouse and maybe its a metaphor for what some are dealing with in which they dont want to deal with but there is also a utilization of both at times to scare the mouse and the elephant while also using cats against birds in which was not supposed to be. The Cat and the Mouse get along more than one some think especially when the Cat is a lion but the Mouse might not be what some think either. The rigidity in regards to certain archetypal shaping and how some have been using as such constitutes for need for being able to be flexible in ways that some are clamoring for. There needs to be the flexibility that the good relay regarding this paragraph. Purple speaks. It&#39;s not just good and bad except that for a certain amount it is. It&#39;s also about different directions except that the one direction will suffice. The One direction was always clarified, correct? That auxiliary where spiritual adhere to parameters from certain Authorities where they can be a part of certain direction but also banners as well as other kind in certain capacity. What does that look like regarding the one direction. I figured close to the One direction would be saving most if not all in 100% safe ways instantaneously. The thing about defense in the moment and always being protected in which is a part of many directions can be a part of that one direction and is a part of that one direction. Fin. We can facilitate the decent as parts of the one direction indicated and dont you think there is a holding it down for that in which needs forming up at times? There does but its less of a worry by way of modern moral direction and that doesn&#39;t mean there isn&#39;t stringent moral in charge. What did Arion indicate regarding this paragraph. What did the Good relay regarding this Diary Entry.<br><br>There has been moments of battle that I hadn&#39;t written down, one of which had to do with me wearing head phones next to a marker board, that was a pretty bad one so said and it felt like dimensional kind of warfare , like bermuda triangle kind of stuff. I believe the same night that first stone appeared in my mouth, flashing redish magenta but I felt it was more good than what some said even with aesthetics where then used but there was also action attachment potentially, it looked and felt like a genie came out of it and enveloped me. Similar to ears energies expanding outwards in a circle regarding when i take off my headphones and also similar to the eyes energies moving outwards and upwards in curve today when not wearing sunglasess something about solar star system star as well. The Stone appearing might have been after or even on another day but something tells me it was after, I had started talking about Gods that are physical and I know there are regular people that are gods and I know that Spirit can be and God Spirit but there is something there in regards to power level that I explained in this process earlier on. The perception of what one considers at times has been in association with certain kind of powerful with abilities in which isn&#39;t always an indicator of Godhood but for in front of the scenes purposes at times has been the indicator because how would we know otherwise and maybe the point is that we dont know. Heroes and Gods. There is sometimes a fine line in between but a line nonetheless. Imagine if heroes even with abilities were considered the average Joe to Gods. Realistically though there is an overlap regarding heroes and Gods and I find it strange that it would be the hero more akin to saving especially upon the white energy, again though many Gods do save and some are tired of such a way of life and classification having to be about saving. Heroes open their eyes. <br><br>The fact that the good as well as other kinds can facilitate certain darker kind and other kinds in ways near as good if not better than the real thing exists. What is the expanded information regarding this.<br><br>Late at night after a suppressed point to the conversation and pretty much the entire conversation for some in which I then turned off one of my recordings midway through. I was upset and it had to do with more than just the import that some are arguing over regarding my recordings in which both are correct in certain manners. Some how I felt older in the morning upon waking up and there was a sleep sickness that set in after some realistic dreams of Jurassic park. I knew that I was that kind of person that didn&#39;t want to disrupt certain things upon some mishap on my end and that when I walk away I wanted there to be somebody better than me that takes over, I knew that that was probably not as much of a difficult task as to what some gave me credit for but maybe being late to the party had its benefits. The Kind of party though was a long time ago, in fact some would say that it was in the Land before time, even though Natural Time existed in the Original Setting. I did explain though some of this yesterday in my kitchen.<br><br><br><br><br>Updates thus far 6:01pm, October 17th, 2020.<br>Updates thus far 10:13pm, October 17th, 2020.</div>
