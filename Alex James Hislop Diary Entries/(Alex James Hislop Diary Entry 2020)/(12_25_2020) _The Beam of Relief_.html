<div class="title">(12/25/2020) &quot;The Beam of Relief&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I had noted beams of light and energy from the crown chakra emerge at times within my own life process. Like one of those beams on the cover of star wars. Shooting upwards from my head area, more to do with the light than some would admit. I had noted at times movement of machinisms that provided a sense of relief in the correct and right of things. Like watching a television show where a character that hadn&#39;t gotten just dues finally received. There is literally body energies in regards to right and wrong as well as fair and unfair. Somehow this beam this day felt correct in the kind of normality donzo obviously that existed with good reasonings. Some of those machinisms that I had seen with the maneuvering that have happened was kaiju related, like peering into a window sighting dimensional where monsters are pulled from people. It was interesting that I had worked on monster rights and where these kinds of monsters observed were more cute and cuddly than other kinds could ever be. Reality though told of terror beyond measure in how some would view such beasts. Anger some through some of them but it wasn&#39;t always so. There were ones born of love and kindness for the kind of vent and relief that some instructed. Anger and Love spoke of personal at times. The beam out of Godzilla&#39;s mouth never seemed more justified when aimed in the correct direction. The fact that I could look at those movies and be reasurred that the beam was aimed correctly gave me hope. It was an interesting synergy of partial reasoning for the kind of chakra beam that had emerged on my head area in the kind of things done to my mentality area. Mazes of soft discomfort for me and different kinds of horrors for others spoke of the kinds of symbiotic decent, who knew if I was experiencing more than just petty discomforts more in line with what others were experiencing. Science some of Godzilla and so did nature. It was interesting that Kong and Godzilla both had similar qualities more similar than what some wanted to admit. Both didn&#39;t want to be bothered anymore and it was reflecting in symbolism at times in how some felt spiritually on this planet if their had been spiritual harassment whether be considered worse or not. People had a special power too and many had their own anima for what they considered their own anima to be. The dark underlying frighten of what ifs in unison with that classic loving and caring spirituality. Birds seemed to have a classic power depicted on the animism totem pole for a reason. Defense in the moment so natural that even the circle of life soft way of explaining different ways of life wasn&#39;t going to sooth and maybe even the animal kingdom agreed in a certain manner given the ways of life facilitation that could exist. They could still hunt and feed without any harm taking place and the true blood esque so close to the real thing truth happened to exist and did cater to those that were seeking something more. To explain that harm could still exist without it actually existing, that no one had t that didn&#39;t want to experience such, didn&#39;t have too at the same time while those that wanted to create such could still do so with stimuli near as good if not better and without having to get harmed. Some needed to understand that this needed to be done in certain dimensional sometimes beyond but that the beyond could traverse past natural barriers of shitty politics behind the scenes to achieve as such. The good have more power than the bad. It was the good to shake our fists towards for the higher true good with most power to achieve such logical proceedings. Maybe it was those two points that such proceedings could be achieved and that the good could save most if not all that invoked a side ways stare agressional from some of my anima at times.<br><br>When I woke up today after seeing a certain kind of bad guys under house arrest and certain kind of accord potentially masked as caught and cry well might have been with a certain kind of magical prowess and realism prowess from some catching the bad throughout the day. There had been a maneuvering and told of being quiet quick transportation and see what would happen as well as talking points about the natural original setting state and the original creator. Specific emphasis opin regards to that good programs of shadowing actions by the good that was created by original creator probably in the first. There was also a quick movement for some of that in which has been labelled realism brown. Earlier morning there had been lazer shows of certain kind who had enough. How much had been put into play to smoke and mirrors some of the things that had happened as well as maneuvering on regards to some of the life on earth. I had fallen asleep today again and upon waking feeling like I had digested myself in a certain, being put more in front of the scenes with an emphasis of sight upon me in which might be a smoke and mirrors to what happened 12 hours previous or it might be a part of it. They say there had been more it to than that regarding this paragraph but to be true there was more to it than what I have been naturally anyhow for the kinds of spiritual history I hadn&#39;t fully depicted with my physical writings. Even stuff I did note physically psychically.</div>
