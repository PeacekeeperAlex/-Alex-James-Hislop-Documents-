<div class="title">(01-09-2020)</div>
<div class="content">Fight in the early morning waking up at 2 AM. Certain battle ensuing. Continued harassment on those lines as to who I am in a certain sense but also continued trying of making this process more erratic. The real truth is that it has less to do with that. There was a stealing variable spoken of and again some trying to distance a certain in association with me in a certain manner. Some of it decent and some of it not. There are those wanting it to be more turbulent and trying to associate me with certain ordinance. More in front of the scenes dimensional compared to light might look to be more like what we have seen in the physical in which some of it is in overlap for a portion. In that context emphasized in self defense and defense of my own as well as the defense of others has created a perception and relayance of truth for a certain kind not being the aggressors but rather the defendors. How much manipulation in the spirit has happened to make a look of certain kind that are of that to not be that. This isn`t solely in regards to certain arcetypes but we have seen the damage regarding for some of it but rather I viewed it similarly in that multiple banners going through and clarifying from up top but also where leaders located. I did  not incarnate for some of the things that some have insinuated and I certainly didn`t incarnate to get spiritually hurt. The continued utilization and turbulence regarding the air channeling should  not fall back on some of the air nations to a degree need be understood. Space seemed more distant yesterday on my end as well in how they can feng shui dimensional and how I sense upon psychictivity. There is two archetypes, a loving caring compassionate kind that does not want to experience harm or hurt ever and another more in line with blue alliance types that make the world go round. Except that the latter hasn`t only been steeped in Blue because of some of the interaction and the former isn`t always pink. The common was out last night is what they said. I don`t know if there was connection with some of the events taking place on my end. It seemed that the desensitization in regards to spiritual and other dimensional in some of the battle and conflict as well as other kinds should not be told to be how some of the physical want to feel towards such things but it should also be noted that some of them if not all of them can only go so far. That doesn`t mean that we cant have discussions about such things and it doesn`t mean that certain societal can`t speak in regards to such topics and themes. There are those who are pissed off at the utilization of this process that somehow says that certain kind can`t even speak of some of the normality understood by science and other means, and when they look at some of the poor bastards in front of the scenes in the look that some of them can`t even talk about some of the baselines. Like small things let known that is common and even considered by some to be elementary. The scary part is the economics regarding another kind more wild and unruly especially upon some saying that somehow if a physical is not suppose to speak about such baselines let alone myself and the kinds of use in regards to other dimensional by way of some of those in which even some of the unruly are not looking for and for some of them are tired of having to deal with some of blowback of the interaction in regards to myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. There had been spiritual through today in which have <br><br>There had been another spiritual letting know of different kinds of factors and circumstance of importance. In subtle fashion they have done really well although there is a look in which says now is not the time to move some of it if not all of it. Multiple kinds doing this days previous in certain fashions and some saying financial in the mix in which I felt was a supporting party indicating something else. Certain kinds of endings in regards to certain ways of proceeding.<br><br>Spiritual that are involved in holds and medical as well as certain regularity stationary in regards to certain kind spoken about and understood to be for what it is but also not fully understood for some of it. The focus from some had been quality of life and fairness upon some of the anti-camp decent actions in which upon further observation and even out in the open explanation reveals that there was other machinisms helping and saving as well as other kinds. This doesn`t denote that their are certain kinds of spiritual in certain situations in which need remedy regardless. <br><br>It spoke of forming up and there has been speaking of forming and I continue to traverse in certain areas while stationary in others but all the while forming continues to feels like it`s happening. <br><br>There have been some soothsayings as of late on my end since I started back up in that direction right before I had to repair my comp. I have continued and the kinds of meaning and card draw have been a bit wild on my end in what I am discerning especially in regards to meaning and symbolism.<br><br>Retrieval Storylines in regards to Lavender.<br><br>Movement of dimensional noted, feelings like less spiritual within my process although an understanding that there still is a lot of spiritual in which for some is a normality. Ways of setting up dimensional around me upon the plans that my Main Spirit Guides relayed for this paragraph prove we can have a lot of spiritual around this process in manners in which is viable. The workers in higher light could have it done instantaneously given the correct measure. Certain spiritual wanted me to talk about legal to a certain degree past couple days and there was noted to be potentially happening regarding. There was a tell days previous, within the past month about my legal under duress as well but I am not certain it was what some thought it was and legal is one of those ones you don`t want to put under duress especially upon subject itself upon caseworks.<br><br>direction in regards to dimensional and how that matters at times. Movement in different directions reflecting different spiritual culture and dimensional setup. Its almost a metaphorical for direction of oneself and the experiences garnered in how it can be different with different direction and how it can be the same regardless for some of it if not all of it.<br><br>Non-Expression<br>Cops<br>Parameter works within the confines of Moral Code<br>The let knows that certain spiritual cops employ non-expression and in ways in which can facilitate multiple law in which fit the Moral Code as well as other Codes.</div>
