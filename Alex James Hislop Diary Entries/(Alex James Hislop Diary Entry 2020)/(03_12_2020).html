<div class="title">(03/12/2020)</div>
<div class="content">Attack of self, yesterday might have been a ruse the kinds of attacks insinuated, good said to be around to pull a maneuver but good really was around in multimedia please capacities.<br><br>Some are trying to calm that there are certain bad sitting on resources but certain good have tried to give out those resources, not all of it, and its extension of something that might be taking and some might be saying that the case and trying to have happen. Resources of peace is one of them and should be understood as such. Certain spiritual strongarmed at times and interrupted in manners in which has made it difficult to relay certain information. Certainly n Machinisms and spiritual taken over.<br><br>Attacked in the night, between 1am and 2am, eyes especially, something seen in regards to other dimensional anatomy growth. Memory and eyes. Spiritual anatomy affected, Memory viewer seen to have been placed to a spiritual and other dimensional depicted in dream to be a certain interaction area. Other-dimensional anatomy affected to the point partially manipulated to thought to be to the point of affecting my channeling and movement. Smooth blue groups around me for a portion and something else taking place. Psychological stuff taking place, invoking of calm. <br>Fat tissues changing. Softer fat seen in a certain body archetype being invoked in regards to myself. Not certain what that means. Not what I want necessarily. Certain stacking of resources happening at times in regards to my house and others that my main Spirit guides indicated. Trying to create bad things to happen to spiritualism culture. The idea that I got resources for watching a spiritualist content while also claimed that I have been dealing with spirituality. Spiritually surgery taking place in regards to me partially by way of some of the attack throughout the night. Again soft skin invoked, why is this taking place?<br><br>1) Ways of Life<br>2) Quality of Life <br>3) Facilitation of Ways of Life in the manners that those that my Main Spirit Guides indicated relayed.<br><br>There was something that supposedly went away and changed but also a certain warfare commenced. Something move overlapping myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in which might have something to do with it. Certain kinds of systems employed behind the scenes spiritually. It was like some wanted to make me look like a certain kind of truther, not that there is anything wrong with that and how the truther on this world at times has been the scrappy underdog pure against the system but there was a truth big in the mix. Some looked at me and said I wasn&#39;t that at times but the understanding that I am of a certain kind of system in which upon truth is bigger than what some thought the systems has made it seem a certain kind at times. Certain kind tried to switch something, make it be known that i find that the banner bullshit and ways of life bullshit that is getting in the way of quality of life especially safety to be appalling and upsetting. I discerned there to be a certain conflict in regards to redtape in achieving having a quality of life and having quality of life. This is one of the conflicts of the kind that my Main Spirit Guides relayed in regards to this writing. Forming up seems to be a conflict in and of itself which seems to lend towards the previous upsetting factors especially upon ways of life facilitation in which exist. It&#39;s not that we ca&#39;t facilitate ways of life it&#39;s that some don&#39;t want to do it as recommended to be true in higher light for a larger portion. Certain banners forming up brouhaha and looking bad and torches, pitchforks going around saying that a certain kind of group from higher light. Forming up of different aspects of banners in which operate as a single banner capacity at times. <br><br>There is a let know of an opposite viewpoint that upon trying to figure down below and lower and in smaller conflict as well as things of that nature that some higher ups are dealing with some other matter and not paying attention to those below. There is a hypothesis in which exists that somehow says that if we do all the smaller stuff in the context of how the banners and cultures below indicated that somehow that is the better way. Except that ways of life and a lack of facilitating those ways in the manners that the groups that my Main Spriit Guides indicated in Higher Light relayed seems to be causing problematics in regards to safety in and of itself. This isn&#39;t to say that there isn&#39;t this sort of nonsense up higher above either. <br><br>Certain kind of realism group was said to have been attacked at times, a realism and logic that reminds of physicals on this physical planet earth in which would look at situations and understand from an ethical standpoint that there is a problem. Memory, the growth and creation of memory exists. I have felt memory grow atop like a tree. <br><br>There was a let know that certain kind in the mix in regards to certain aspects of certain kind that came around during those times of schedule difficulties in which is being said to be more than what it seems that a portions mislabeled was myself in which potentially goes to that story line of me being captured in which rather might have been me shadowing certain kind trying to do nefarious work in vicinity of myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. This might extend to storylines of spiritual egging me on to jump in via memory in front of the black bureau. <br><br>There was another storyline of a form utilization maybe more in regards to an ops group and certain kind looking for answer to the questions to get out of certain situations, potentially a part of that storyline in regards to Train to Busan storyline that unfolded after the movie in my bedroom. <br><br>Now it&#39;s being let known that there could have been aspects from my life in regards to events that would unfold and the piss poor excuse of fame as to why there might have been moments beforehand when I was less in the mix physically in regards to some of my family members and some of the turbulence that has happened at times. This in and of itself isn&#39;t new but still depending on the degree a problem. There was something different back then correct though? In that I hadn&#39;t fully been creating what I am now and doing what I am now and some are saying what is the point if that isn&#39;t to be used as an excuse. <br><br>Those pure good reapers. Especially the ones in regards to self and making sure passing on is Kosher. <br><br>Themes:<br>#Rememberance #Peace #Self #Influence #BehindTheScenesManipulation #MethodToTheMadness #RestrainingOrders #Subconsious #Safeguards #BannerPretenders #WhatExactlyAreThey #WaysOfLife #QualityOfLife <br><br>Medical Observations:<br>Within the past couple days there was a moment where I saw a round knob on seemingly on my tail bone in which might have been made to look that way smashed by certain other dimensional in which I felt pain shoot up my tail bone. It was like an other dimensional punched my tailbone but rather it might have been certain spiritual utilizing technology. Still feel sore today from it. I feel it was healed decent and I felt there was spiritual healers regarding but I am not certain what it was fully about<br></div>
