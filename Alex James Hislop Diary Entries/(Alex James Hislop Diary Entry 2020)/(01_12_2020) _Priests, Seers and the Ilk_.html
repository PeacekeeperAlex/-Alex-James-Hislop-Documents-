<div class="title">(01/12/2020) &quot;Priests, Seers and the Ilk&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Dreams:<br>There was a candle lit dinner atmospheric to the left of me in how I discerned upon waking up. There was dinning room and ballroom atmospherics it was look to be some sort of awards ceremony. There was an interplay of dorm rooms and comedy in what looked to be documentary style following. Another had to do with white and grey in a what looked to be an outdoor prison remembrance of friends with one kicking out to the right with favorites understood. There had been debate in which one was bad but maybe it happened to be that all three were good. There were more visuals in overlap. It felt like there was an interplay about certain spiritual in overlap and potentially an aspect of allpersonal in regards to certain physicals on this planet. I had fallen asleep to a basketball game but I felt there was a utilization of certain hollywood machinisms upon me as well when I woke up. Maybe it was a recharged big of planet Earth lending. There was a morality social media impressional of I told you so. A certain kind of the societal clouth a bit more dry. I hated some of the insinuations at times within this process for the fear and terrific that it instilled. I felt disjointed in the way that I was experiencing certain dream infrastructures and visuals upon waking up this day. <br><br>Activity:<br>It would eventually segway to talking about a character priest and seer as well as authority of morality in what I discerned. Movement of stimuli and impressional upon certain kinds of perception can make one think certain things to be true that could very well be psychic and perception manipulation. Story moments of blue Argonauts and white superman. Of course it would be another segway to sports. I did feel powerful morality this day around in many capacities in which there was a segway last night upon some of the fact and truth of having had enough of being blamed and utilized in ways not intended. Somehow because of my experiences within the past five years there were some under the wrong assumption that there wasnt those borrowing from something different other than my actions and the building of perception in this place and the real true happened to reflect that there was more positive perception in the kinds of point towards truth existent not only in pre-cursor and post cursor of life but the overlap upon me as well. Not to mention actions that I have perpetuated for truth that happens to be way more moral and caring as well as good. If it wasn&#39;t a problem then what was the problem. <br><br>There was a talking point on morality. It had to do with whether or not or brethren of greater morality had safeguarded us. Some of them did it recreationally. I had looked towards the kind of experiences that might have been still taking place and the response was told many times that there was rel reasons. So I had asked what those real reasons were. I had happened to see the interplay of spiritual that knew more than dimensional for true. I didn&#39;t want to be lead on by the in front of the scenes styles of play that were for many supposed to be geared for saving for when I compared what those real reasons were between those two groupings of dimensional and spiritual as well as metaphysical, the comparison left wanting for the kind of run around waste time. When the true good held the control variable in ways that spoke of the beginning in preparation of just in case that would be prevented, the asking point how that worked and why it worked was warranted. The answer to the previous question as to what those real reasons happened to be was not suppose to extend towards evil. We didn&#39;t have to rely on baddies and vagabonds to suppress something in which didn&#39;t exist. When time was such a point towards as well, I didn&#39;t understand why some wanted to waste such a precious resource as that. If on either side of this dimensional physical there happened to be dimensional moving at both quick and slower pace in time comparison then we potentially had the answer for the kind of time that the Original Setting had in comparison. Gazillions upon Gazillions of years per physical second. That was a lot of time. I had seen that somehow there those choosing different than a certain kind of saving taking place. I had wondered why. I didn&#39;t want to hear it from them. I felt the real answer could be given from neutral fact and didn&#39;t they always say that the neutral knew information. They knew both truth and fact, but also knew neutrality. Good and Morality pointed towards the reasons why and it had less to do with work and it obviously had less to do with ability. For some of them they said it had more to do with what one chose. That family didn&#39;t want to do battle with one another so somehow that meant that family elsewhere had to ill benefit. There happened to be more Family that wanted most if not all to be saved for true. I had pointed towards something and there was reasons given in how other had chosen and I felt that I didn&#39;t deserve to ill benefit because of how others chose. The fact that good could intervene and save across the board not pursued in certain moments because of how others chose? I didn&#39;t ask the question who was not choosing most if not all to be saved and for the good to intervene. The answer as to why usually had something to do with threatenings and not being able to choose that. The observation had been seen that the good can transcend that. The terrible thing about some of it was that there was those moments where we looked and saw that there was innocence involved and that this was in regards to defending innocents in moments of need be. We were looking at true good and on such days as these when remembrance reigned a certain free for knowing what it was supposed to be. It&#39;s one thing to choose not to help but then to choose to impede upon certain kind in action to save the innocence. It was that kind of spiritual that wouldn&#39;t know the difference in regards to their own morality and that of true morality while there being a stark difference in the kinds of utilization. The life utilization upon me as well as others at times on this planet for the in the moment famous moments utilized in ways way past acceptability that didn&#39;t speak of morality even in use of such that seemed to be not the true at times for when the foreman wasn&#39;t looking and it was considered a form of attack by those that created those moments for what they considered those moments to be. The good weren&#39;t just behind the scenes, they were also in front of the scenes.  <br><br>The spiritualist was brought up in a certain manner earlier upon waking up after going to sleep with certain kinds of &quot;white Suits&quot; upon me. There happened to be a play upon guideship storyline that had been brought up. <br><br>Themes:<br>#Family #Love #Faith #Gaming #Sports #Spirituality #MovementOfDimensional #QualityOfLife #Interaction #Experiences #Truth <br>#Time #Nature #Areas #Business #Religion #English #Language<br>#Stealing #Bullying #Threats #Strongarming #Power #ConfrontingEthical #WaysOfLifeFacilitation LineUtilization #StanceUtilization #LifeUtilization<br></div>
