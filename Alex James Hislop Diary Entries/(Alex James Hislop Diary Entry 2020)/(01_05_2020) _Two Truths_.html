<div class="title">(01/05/2020) &quot;Two Truths&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Quote:<br>Flexibility comes from having multiple choices; wisdom comes from having multiple perspectives.<br>--Robert Dilts<br><br>Thought:<br><br>Activity:<br>The culture continues to change on my end. A profound reading in regards to NDE Account seemed to change an interaction in which was kind of hanging around. Almost as if it was expected to have happen to change. In the mix of these changes there has been maneuvers in which has been perceived as unclouth from a certain kind seemingly taken away in which at times has been labelled anti-camp culture and immorality culture in that the difficulty has been that I have been wanting to move away from such culture in the manners that my Main Spirit Guides indicated while still being able to facilitate them. we take a look at the amount of spending within the confines of interaction facilitation pertaining to certain physicals and things of that nature. Then the look upon those up top in which says that expense shouldn&#39;t be the the problematic in the mix especially with the amount of resources in play and in stock. We take into account the kind of resources saved and also lost upon the new year in regards to Earth-Based and I feel if we have time on our side as well as dimensional access, that we can facilitate some of the immorality culture and other kinds by way of content experiences and immorality alternatives as well as other kinds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated while still maintaining the ways of life in regards to those that were promoting immorality in other unsavory ways. I am uncertain what the problem is in being able to provide the technology and dimensional overlaps needed to be able to facilitate this alongside that in which has been labelled the event on physical earth-based. How many other questions in the mix in regards to just moving on, upwards to cleaner energies and leaving those behind in a certain manner but it&#39;s not just upwards and onwards but other kinds as well too. If there is enough power within the light and there is, if there is viability, and there is, if there is willingness, and there is, if there is ways to this without any effort at all and there is then what exactly are we waiting for? Look at all of the ways we can facilitate such proceedings without it being utilized and taking advantage of in manners in which would make it difficult to proceed. One of the reasonings I bring this up has to do with quality of life of not only those of immorality culture pertaining to Earth-Based but also the quality of life regarding those that haven&#39;t done anything wrong on earth-based. Yes there are many protected. Yes there are many with quality of life spiritually. Can we say that everyone on earth-based innocent has been protected spiritually or otherwise? The truth on this makes a certain kind in the spirit swirl in dismay at times especially at the possibilities of remedy in regards to such a topic. Two truths. and it&#39;s the many more that might be bigger. <br><br><br>Content Experiences: <br>Watched Gargoyles and beat Mafia II.<br><br>- (I had felt strange today. There was moment where I felt like I had no energy and I do realize that there are spirits in which are utilizing my energy but in a certain capacity in how it happens to translate on my end on this has felt to be like some wanted me to not appreciate my life. There was also here and there antagonistic but for the most part as has been uniform with the past five days, I have been able to discern stellar defense on my end in a certain context. There had been talk though throughout the day here and there about what I and other are actually experiencing behind the scenes. They had been making me feel like my life isn&#39;t worth it and that there is culture in which says that I could be doing a bunch more. That there are others that do it much better than me and of course probably side stepping the fact that I am on my day off but even with that i think some look towards my regular days and say there isn&#39;t enough advocations. I think some looked at hero culture and wanted me to be more. I think there are also some angry that I do not sacrifice to the degree that would some would find acceptable in my live interaction)<br>- (I had read a really interesting NDE Account in which upon me reading a portion I had to step due to the kinds of energies I was feeling. Some negative in the mix and facilitation of jealousy in which I don&#39;t as I am of that culture that wants celebrate success. I went to bed and had a dream. I woke up again and continued reading and to be true throughout the day I had been resting only bed because of body energies. After reading a bit more I got on the subject again of that sort of topic in regards to Nature. The true nature and discussion about such a topic, I pointed towards what my Main Spriit Guides indicated in regards to conversation and debate facilitation. I did what my main Spriit Guides indicated regarding. I felt a certain kind of live, awareness, heightened energies and crowd to a certain extent, I feel some were trying to utilize this as an excuse for certain actions but some also facilitated multiple kinds of conversations as smoke and mirrors and other kinds in which then saw multiple kinds of debate and conversation as well as other kinds take place. I kept focus on what my Main Spirit Guides indicated with emphasis in regards to the conversation and debate that I had asked to facilitate. It was about multiple things but I felt it was needed and it resolved in a certain manner but might still be taking place, there were shortened versions. I continued reading the NDE eventually. Still I felt a culture of Afterlife around me when I started reading again but also at times when I wasn&#39;t at least for the later portion of the article. It felt like I was under review by a certain kind in which interestingly enough I have multiple of reviews monthly. Either way the article spoke to me i a certain manners and the key portion i wanted to take away was the positivity invoked in regards to actions and non-actions of myself. I have felt at times, especially upon noting some of the impact in regards to movie, series and music and specifics in regards to certain NDE account already that it can feel like when I read something that the content itself is sometimes influenced from my process and self. I think it should be understood and even in regards to subject the matter itself the Ripple Affect that we have in regards to our own actions. It had listed multiple kinds of things in which had profound impact and I couldn&#39;t help but take certain moments and look at it in regards to myself as if someone was speaking to me. I think one of the things that is forgotten in the process in which might be the better way of going is the kind of chance and communication that spirit have in relaying information from Near Death Experiences in which I there is the idea of relaying experiences and communication in regards to those that read those NDE Accounts but also the understanding that ones own NDE can be personal at times. I felt though that one of his missions statements in regards to the physical that experienced the NDE was to relay some of the experience with those that would benefit. There was moments where I had difficulty in regards to this upsetting topic as of late anyhow, having to do with NDE facilitation and the fact that there might be different kinds that facilitate such experiences different from what I associate with certain Spirit Groups. I feel I have been positive a decent amount of the time if not more so in regards to reading these NDEs and not being antagonistic.
