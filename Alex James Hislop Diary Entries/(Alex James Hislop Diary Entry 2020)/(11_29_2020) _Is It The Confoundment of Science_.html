<div class="title">(11/29/2020) &quot;Is It The Confoundment of Science?&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>One observation; Either Spiritual life has always existed in the literal sense or there was a beginning to the emergence of Spiritual life in a literal sense. How would science go about explaining both of those theories? One or the other seems to be within most if not all Origin Theories. Understand that I do feel that there is Immortality and that we do live forever but in the observation I am noting, has to do with whether there was beginning to spiritual life or if some of our memories go on forever into the past. Just because we live forever doesn&#39;t mean we have lived forever. There is a natural confoundment in regards to the theory that says that there wasn&#39;t a beginning emergence of spiritual life and that spiritual life has always existed. Where is the beginning, is a natural question upon such a theory. Of course, if it was spiritual emergence that had happened in the beginning, then how did that happen might be another confoundment. If the Natural Original Setting was observed to have existed before the original life, then what does that tell us? How would that emergence have taken place? Wouldn&#39;t it be fascinating if it was miraculous theory that was more predominant in the kind of unexplainable that exists? How would the Original Creator not be able to let know of natural observation of what he didn&#39;t observe even with research into high science beyond most. First memories, live life, learn and then reflection tells us that there is still a chance? Did we expect a book of explanations to pop up into emergence with spiritual life? If there was spiritual life beyond then yes but what we are speaking on is the Origin of Life. Understanding that certain kind have been trying to interject spiritually to claim what they thought was definition of English wasn&#39;t going to hold back the truth. <br><br>There were Authorities and older emblems safeguarding that language as well as other languages on this planet to be true. God reminded of English and English reminded of God but it wasn&#39;t the only language he spoke. White of English was a tell but the multi colour of other languages on this planet was a tell too. God wasn&#39;t only white, he was multi colour. There was different archetypes besides the weathered old white man in the kind of court wizard surprise and there was others beyond the physicians of the past kind of archetype as well which did remind of God as well as other names and terminologies that you could see within the shaping of regular people and spiritual at times. There was God of Earth that understood many of the archetypes seen within shaping and classic Earth-Based Mythology. God of International existed. There was aspects of God that worked with specific shaping though, for example physicians of the past remind of God because God worked with science. He helped shape the emergence of science on this planet. There is an Earth-Based emphasis in regards to the name and terminology as well as word of God. The Good for true in intention had safeguarded that in many different ways and shouldn&#39;t have had to by way of History reflection upon the first, second and even third ages for how I have labelled those sections of Natural Time in regards to the Natural Original Setting reflect mostly positive and moral as well as neutral. <br><br><br><br>I woke up today and it seemed quiet again, I felt a past process impressional upon me in which reminded of my grandfather and history but really is probably from my father in the kinds of impressional west at times upon. It reminded of the moose mountains. It felt interaction situated even though there was anger and I had seen that similar impressions potentially mislabelled as bad but I also realized there had been use of impressional at times in ways not clouth to those in which classically belonged too. There had also been a certain kind trying to change perception in regards to certain archetype as well and wonderment as to how certain archetype infrastructures had arisen as well. <br><br>Early morning I had remembered certain interactions having to do with God and Heaven especially with Earth-Based Emphasis and there was explanational in regards to what Heaven as well as other kinds at times had to deal with in the beyond Earth-Based kind of sight. That there was reasoning for going certain routes in waitingment of higher up good at times. I don&#39;t want to some misunderstand as Heaven was more in line with itself in how I viewed Heaven, a bit of an emphasis on Earth-Based Heavens for a portion of and a portion of my own Heavens in what partially complete when I would reference Heaven. Heaven was one of those terminologies sometimes similar to God, Earth and even Moon in how one could use such terminologies and the power in which incurred upon the names. There was a look of Faith and Science yesterday during moments of Heavenly light created by physical light within proximity of honest communication. I didn&#39;t know why I kept seeing creation of energies through me and my process in large capacities at times to be true. See a physical light interplay create multiple things spiritually and it happening on large scale. Heavenly light in this instance was the tell. <br><br>There was a moment where I segwayed from playing a driving game and then an energy simulation game in which I had then chosen to play a violent video game. I dont know why the word that has been escaping didn&#39;t manifest upon the karmic variables of using such a word similar to cornering the market, but somehow it was known to have done justice anyhow on this subject in which has involved the perception building and interaction setting as well as shakedown regarding some who are playing video games in not only in the spirit but also physically. Maybe later on upon certain we will take a look and realize how important it was to actually have a certain communicational tell and let know but also realize how in hand upon handle the good really did in the strangle hold they had upon some at times even with a certain variable existing letting know that the good truly were the angrier. Can you imagine trying to play a violent video game where certain other dimensional try to shakedown and claim they had a certain corner of the market when that was a bold face lie as well but then tried to poach and arrest people for playing certain violent video game and I know that there is a line but I am not talking traversing past that line in this instance even if I do hold certain creeds for the simple reasoning as to what certain maps look like in a regular societal sort of way. I was under the impression that form utilization was understood in a certain manner and that it was less to do with form utilization and rather how some used form utilization. Why did I get that impression that some from a business standpoint were disgruntled. I didn&#39;t know why. To be true. Because the Good had ways to be able to facilitate even darker kinds of business without their being a problem. I was angry with the most powerful good that had moral intention for the facts on sheet that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Somehow to save ones own and ones self as well as those others had indicated that one needed to go supposedly labelled more extreme in kind of the normality misunderstood. Like somehow there wasn&#39;t large percentages of spirit in All That Is that felt that most if not all should be saved. When that was and is the truth. Just because they felt that way, didn&#39;t mean they chose that way, but whatever the hell politics were getting in the way, didn&#39;t have a good enough reason to get in the way for true if the Good did have the power to save most if not all instantly and safely. If that latter was true than that latter was true too. Except that it was the Moral with good intention that could transcend whatever block it was for true because it was included in Truth. Why would the Good ever let go of that kind of power given the kind of preparation and importance on such an issue especially upon the rise of that importance even though already noted to be of import. Some pointed towards a letting go because of a moving on supposed indicating that it was cared even more so in the beginning but what they forgot was that in which they wanted to ignore and at times that the good wanted to ignore for maddening fact if they did have the power to be able to save, most if not all. You don&#39;t think creation took over for certain machinisms from the Original Creator? You don&#39;t think there would be other kinds of ways? Either way the aiming of my writing only pertained to what my Main Spirit Guides relayed. The good had advanced ways to safeguard many different kinds of viewers, audiences and things of that nature. I have chosen those ways and do note that when I referenced the Good, a large variable included having good intention. It was this kind of interplay that should have be talked about more often in the kinds of psychic interaction and awareness that I held and that others as to why they interjected things within their writing of similar ilk. That I would try to safeguard by way of what I could do on my end existed. Like creating a disclaimer for Earth-Based Internet to try and help. It was not only a bit of a redundancy by way of already creating a physically worded Earth-Based disclaimer but also by way of the spiritual information that my Main Spirit Guides referenced in regards to this writing. </div>
