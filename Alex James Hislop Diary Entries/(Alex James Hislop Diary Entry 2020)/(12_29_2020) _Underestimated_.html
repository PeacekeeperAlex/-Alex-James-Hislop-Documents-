<div class="title">(12/29/2020) &quot;Underestimated&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>There had been godly and holy energies upon during this movie experience. Somehow it was supposed to be a more recreationally experience. I didn&#39;t know if that was the case whether a comparison as to the experience was really the line of the conversation. Titans and Gods interplay upon a movie about monsters and smalls. I felt the light to be a great part about the move and heaven everpresent understood. I had noted there might have been a year of release, filmed and watched interplay at times upon some of the movies I watched. Let alone if historic depiction and the kind of further interplays interjected. I had never seen this film and yet still felt there was an argument as to what this was really all bout. Interesting that life reminds and ow many are trying to live their life. Who wouldn&#39;t want to delve into something different to escape a reality not worth accepting at times. That reality was supposedly changing. The pandora would probably indicate that it was earlier heresy that was the red flag on the play let alone whatever the heck it turned into for what today reflects. I had seen this James bond upload upon the normal person at times to try and excuse actions but it was also their for defense and safety. Why was their some able to influence in certain moments, those kinds of directions when not indicated from spiritual guideship. Why was their reasons for Guideships to go similar and disimilar directions that even our morality at times indicated. There was a difference but maybe not to the degree that some think. What the hell else was thier might not be the question to ask upon descript of experience upon such a film that I had just witnessed. But the excuse that it be my writing as to certain have happens upon asking a question such as that might not be the sight either. For if it wasn&#39;t just James Bond and the I&#39;ll, then at what point found acceptable win the day. It felt like the original creator showed up when I was watching this film. There a moment earlier of Jesus upon and it felt story related especially when God showed up. I had been lightworking throughout the film and a handful of actions memory related for a decent sized portion but their was some voice works as well. It was a bit of sadness of the story supression regarding the film experience on my end which did upset but I also knew spiritual machinisms in regards to movies. I had known spiritual hollywood to be able to make the movies seem realistic in manners that I hadnt fully been able to appreciate. I knew they could craft experiences like some of the best. I knew that the facilitation of experiences to me would fit the bill in being enough especially for certain situational. How was I to explain that there was certain kind of filmmakers spiritual that were police officers and guardians. Imagine a famous guardian loved filmmaking and any chance he got he would create a film. There was certain classifications of ways of life, think of duty and work as well as how sometimes there were those that classified both in a certain sense as work. There is others though too. Honour and chivalry. *Expand. There were those spiritual that understood classification in a certain manner that certain physicals sometimes don&#39;t remember on this planet. But at what point too far where when classified something different than life. <br><br>A bit of a disturbance in regards to moving dimensional and interactional. There has been getting younger at times incregards to spiritual aspects of self as well as getting older. I have felt both at times, getting older one day in personality and then the next day getting younger. A natural pheomenon I have noted but our infrastructures too being able to discern bodies in overlap in spiritual that can get older and younger at times. I had noted an interaction reminding of 2019 and anti camp event advocacy. <br><br>There had been continued talking points on new leafs turned off for new year hopes.<br><br>Subtle interactions around. There had been this look away at times for certain attack spiritual that has happened, guardians trying to live their life. Or maybe dealing with things. Certain kind wanting me to stay away from space interactions but also it having less to do with what some think. The information that my Main Spirit Guides wanted me to list in regards to this sentence.<br><br>There is a beautiful look in regards to life and acting. I had seen people and spiritual argue about being certain characters and a look of wanting to be something. There was this look upon portraying a character when it doesn&#39;t go farther than acceptable to hold this look that is sacred. An actor looking at characters to portray sometime notes interesting while flipping through a catalogue but there was another transcendence noted there too. It is felt that there is a line difference for when we are talking about life and portrayal as well as other lines classifying life to a certain degree. How one that wanted to be a character beforehand of lead and famous and strong or with traits one would want within life and that a desire of portrayalof character doesn&#39;t always correspond with. What was the surpassing of interesting within the confines of for the love of acting? <br><br>There was a let know that at times there had been confusing upon lines having to do with right and wrong ways to proceed regardless of subjective. A person chooses something and grouping in proximity I&#39;ll benefit. What does that extends to when it involves banners and nations. There was a let know that some had been shaking and confusing certain kind when choosing something in a certain way. That baseline of quality of life deemed by most higher authorities. There was different variations but all had similar key components in a certain way. The interaction being put upon some had made it so that a question of whether it be better if choosing more rigidity toward that baseline quality of life in the sense that it be less of a problem regarding certain proximities. The key component I looked at as well as others had to do with the truth that no one deserves to be attacked or I&#39;ll benefit from my actions and non-actions especially my choices. That approach was hitting the soft spot of what needed to naturally by way of where many of us we from and morality IQ, but it was also a long time staple that some thought had made it less of a hit upon that sweet spot. Saying that one didn&#39;t deserve to be attacked or ill benefit from others action and non-actions especially others choices might very well be the better way of saying, either way saying it both ways was decent too andit was that working point of understanding natural morality in that point of right and wrong as well as fair and unfair that did protect. It was also told that some didn&#39;t care about that point which was why realism existed. The shit of it was happened to be that there was already layers of compromise and for if there was the kind of disturbances and attacks happening as had been insinuated then a maneuvering and situated for that maneuvering existed. I was one of those that wanted to choose the either way regardless baseline quality of life across the board similar to the either way regardless defense across the board. It was the board that my Main Spirit Guides indicated as to what I was speaking on. Most physicals on this planet were choosing what their guideships chose for them to choose in which did work with their authorities for what they considered their authorities to be. In what most physicals on this planet were doing only pertained to what their guideships indicated for them to pertain. There was expanded information regarding this in the spiritual, a decent amount around the physicals themselves on this planet earth. Again there was handlers in regards to my process and handlers regarding the physicals on this physical planet earth regarding Space and there was many good regarding Space. *Expand and give context, interaction to certain spiritual from space and how there is a normality for certain good regarding to be around physicals on this planet and that the look that physical humans have regarding fright of the thought of physical space and how spiritual doesn&#39;t have to be as scary and how I do not want some Ill utilize that thought but rather let know of the kind of spirituality talked about by physical Spiritualists on this planet.<br><br>I can look at any topic in regards to my process that was spoken about with my out loud voice as well as other kinds my main Spirit Guides listed and know my morality has safeguarded regarding. Like talking points about programs helping the bad that I had talked about or even ways of life facilitation talking points. All talking points I have spoken on physicaly, I know my morality have safeguarded especially in regards to interaction. Early morning there was a movement having to do with interaction atmospherics and dimensional movement. I realized that what I spoke about and created while incarnate in this life as Alex James Hislop was still important even though some didn&#39;t listen and tried to ignore ways that some had gone more decent for not only myself but others on this planet regarding the impact and power regarding my actions. A baseline ripple effect and impact as well as reaction up to a point in what would have gone over better for stability but others too. I had understood that I had moved past certain barriers of spiritual interaction that other physicals were still within. There was many that was good but there as those in which reminded of interaction maneuvering from vegabonds lying within those interactions for a portion. I also knew there safeguards regarding the passing of information that I obtained from the spirit regardless of whether I wrote it down or not. I can look to a spiritual and labeling thatcsareguards and choose for it to be that but there other kinds of safeguard machinisms as well out of safety. There was a communicational in doing certain things. I had been one of those ones traversed past and said amazement regarding me writing withing Google keep notes compared to having hundreds of thousands of followers reading a public post online. There was a natural regarding though similarly seen in regards to media network archives. There was good spiritual systems of public and safety in regards to those archives. I understood there was spiritual online in many different manners and Earth-Based for a large portion if not all were a part of spiritual that understood morality with good intention for true. The communication understood to be maneuvered through other means at times compared to certain actions that supposedly had to do with creating communication more prominately. There was already natural spiritual communication but at times I have noted taking a walk to create communication. If there happens anatural sight upon the outside not as prominant as within the home then that matters. There was still other actions in the home that was noted to create further communication. Metaphorical utilization I had seen regarding movement of communication through metaphor. Someone cooks something and there because metaphorical utilization to create communication. There was alsoo the fact that good spiritual traverse past physical walls. What was the best questions that I could ask fo this paragraph. The answers to those questions relayed. <br><br>The creating of easier and more rewarding for those that understand priorities listed by higher authorities. What did the past put into play regarding this?<br><br>Multi tasking between the good caring and compassionate as well as dealing with darker subjects like warfare, conflict and even certain immoral types. Like being able to pay attention and even partake in enlightened and classical spiritual activities without having sight and awarenesses regarding battle be impacted to degrees unacceptable.  <br><br>Life utilization and form utilization as well as name utilization I feel was a prime discussion regarding this diary entry but nontheless there is still a lot of good points made.<br><br>Themes:<br>#Godzilla #LifeUtilization #Realism #Recreation #Divide #TruthSetRecord #Straight #MoreAntiDecentThanThought #CanOnlyGoSoFar #Personal #Sports #Cinema #Music #Gaming #ForTheThingsWeLove #ForFamilySaved #SynergyOfLifeAndActing #LCBO #CardBeFound #GymClassHeroes #Air #Airforce #Breakthrough #HigherForces #PriorityUnderstood #EasierInvoked #Sight #</div>
