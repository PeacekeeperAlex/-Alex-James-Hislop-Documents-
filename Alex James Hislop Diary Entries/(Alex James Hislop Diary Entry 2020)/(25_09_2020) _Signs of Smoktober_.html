<div class="title">(25/09/2020) &quot;Signs of Smoktober&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>This morning I woke up sad. I didn&#39;t fully know why or remember why for some of it but it had to do partially with some of the handicapness that has existed through me but also in regards to me. Like there was spiritual under duress in certain manners understood through me but that there was some that had been attacked that had become handicapped and/or malformed in certain ways. Somehow the event that had happened right before I went to sleep a sharp spiritual sword through cartilage and then the kind of repairs and medical followed up the next day seen that cartilage healed, almost a spiritual and other dimensional cartilage implant. I woke up the next day it was like I saw a perspective that somebody had been banging the doors to get me to understand and it wasn&#39;t i didn&#39;t understand but rather was trying to live my life. It had to do with some of the scars and handicappish that had happened through me and to me with other selves hobbling around with less than before. At what point do you live your life if you have debilitating characteristic that makes it difficult to even want to live your life. I saw that and there was a certain kind of metaphorical on my back deck when I finally cried in which the sadness suppression of the past 2 months seemed to ease up and I knew that I did feel like not being here any longer, that I in fact wanted to pass on physically but only in ways that my Main Spirit Guides relayed especially if I passed on before 60. I also knew that I had a lot of potential down here and I also had stuff that I wanted to get done, that I had a lot more to do, like creating my Gaming Channel, publish my book and situate some informational placement that still needed to situating. They thought spilt milk in the face of such a life. They didn&#39;t know enough about it. Maybe it was from another perspective but at what point rings true. The real true is that it had less to do with me and rather a utilization regarding me which some were going to have to answer for in legal and non-legal ways. Where I wouldn&#39;t dying physically any time soon because some wanted to utilize me in good capacity. Some of it decent, some if it not. I dont know if I am trying to make a thing of it because I dont know if the better way is to say that I am not trying to make a thing of it with the kind of ill utilization that might brings at times in which speaks of something similar to previously mentioned.<br><br> Right before yesterday before i felt that spiritual sword upon one of my cartilage areas, there was this moment where certain spiritual were to trying to invoke me to be disrespectful in regards to sacred, I spoke my peace and clarified some of my stances but somehow I still felt there was some trying to harass repour regarding and it wasn&#39;t the only one. Movement of dimensional seem to be evident and I am wondering if there moving certain things away in regards to repour and perception. Another thing had to  do with clarifications on my end in which I have already clarified multiple times in that I am not the extreme that some think in regards to saving. They have tried to jack in the box how I respond in certain moments which was said to have harmed my story if I was to be that silent perfection rather than non-silent bull in the China shop. Maybe it has more to do with something else, like proving that Purple, Lavender, Pink and Red Bull Cyclops archetype has and can withstand the weight of being angry in certain moments without it impacting combat to degrees evident. Somehow today there has been this storyline about certain kind line building and trying to continue to say that certain spiritual are more daft than they actually are. Trying to create this perception of daftness in other processes to excuse certain actions. <br><br>Some have had tried to section off good spiritual from me in regards to certain interactions to again put fourth more power in regards to banners interactions. These interaction have been predominately good but still keeping a certain kind of good away from me in which there is less reasoning to do so these days especially with some of the nonsense seen through and understood to be for what it i, like trying to setup certain moments with certain turbulence happening through me so said to have something to do with me but ultimately having less to do with me by way of how it was setup. This is a clue that it might have been good trying to help through certain direction but what direction is that and why the hell is it around here? Again this speaks of certain things having to do with the suppression of spiritual in which we had just been through these past two weeks but instead of facilitating that good spiritual I think they might have been trying to situate to be able to facilitate that good spiritual in which is being utilized as an excuse to set interaction in different manners. I cant complain too much but imagine family not being able to go to your house cause the government needs to situate. hmm. Spiritually it looks crumb. Also there was a tell in the mix about personality. A really cool interaction days previous in which some keeping trying to say something about specifically in regards to Red, Pink, and Black as well as Brown in which I might be mislablelling by way of not being able to fully identify. It had to do with interesting to a certain degree and some trying to say something about certain interaction systems and the need for maintenance and respect. Another ploy might have been to talk about certain interactions this past couple days too impact interactions. Really what I should talk about was that good moment where I felt spiritual that cared about me in certain manners around me. I feel there was certain deployment in the past couple days maybe right around when some said my story had been playing out in front of me, with the red and black blanket with the power of white and that somehow some were not looking at what needed to be seen rather than the manipulation and/or need to abide according to codes in letting certain baddies deploy. There was others though too and I dont know what it ended up looking like especially with kind of good deploying these past couple days specifically regarding the events that played out days previous. What I still discern is that a a lot of good thing still taking place and are continuing to take place with certain interaction areas not reflecting that in hold down capacity and partially cause bad took a look at some things and found what they saw unacceptable and warranting certain direction. <br><br>Resources lists for those that can de more than I in regards to daily defensives that can take a certain capacity that would want to be a part of what my defensives pertain. Include a line of text within my advocations and testifications as well as disclaimers regarding.<br><br>This was the day where I woke up after early morning with the sword upon the cartilige.</div>
