<div class="title">(16/11/2020) &quot;That Highway of Dark Blue&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>The walk reminded me of both realism elements with a tell about going certain direction before hand as well as reminding of other psychic stimuli letting know of form reminiscent of former acquaintance.  There was a tell of other dimensional especially stimuli that reminds of when I refer to setting, sometimes dark grey in which also reminds of audio in a certain sense. There is these moments where I feel like these walks that have been strong since the past couple months, a resurgence of walking having to do with winter and war but really peace and summer for somebody understand why I would walk in winter and why walk for war when you can run. It had been a build up of different kind of walks these past couple months and the kinds of experiences I had had and that other spirits had had, especially upon the replay with the different aesthetic filters as well as experience filters created something special. Lightworks interaction in manners that I can note canvas creation in the sky. Spiritual floating like walking on air when going for a walk in some Spiritual manner reflecting as such for what some would expect regarding certain perception, like somehow walking this earth wasn&#39;t spiritual enough. *Carry on with writing about the walks. <br><br>Later o it felt like we hit a moment where I had chilled laying on my bed, listening to music but right before it was like I was dropped off on a highway. Previously in this process again, there was a moment where I had went to future memory as well as other kinds that my Main Spirit Guides relayed to the moment of my death physically as well as other kinds, partially to elaborate upon yet another point that has been clarified and should be clarified having to do with metamorphosis and passing on, specific to this process but also others in the mix as well as my own guideship clarifying regarding metamorphosis and passing on. There was this moment where we had identified in this process that potentially upon death that physicals nearest to the moment of death itself skip past whatever bullshit it was that some trying to harm us were trying to propose. There was a scare in which should not be impressed upon spiritual having to do with some trying build perception as well as skipping past reality regarding the trying to make the spiritual metamorphosis regarding when the physical passes on to be a certain kind unacceptable within moral parameter. There was also another scare having to do with passing through multiple realms in which the physical passing on does not want to pass through when dying in which is another term for passing on in a certain sense, there is an overlap. It was one of those things I was scared about, why wouldn&#39;t I be at the thought of certain kinds of experiences garnered and not remembered before going to the light, that light intended. I had felt experiences throughout my life where it felt like smalls a part of my body were passing on and going to different existences. Great, but sarcasm aside, sure as shit not so, big fat notso. Was it part of my spirit that was experiences some of the psychic stimuli that I had noted regarding this and was it a pre cursor to something more ominous or the ominous itself that I was scared about, and do note that other physicals on this physical planet earth are not only innocent in regards to what went on in my process but also are different, in a varying capacities. I was also frightened by what some of the spiritual i had noted in my process wanted to try and do in regards to some of the line building in this process and lack of understanding of ethical and moral reasoning in which not only caused disturbance to themselves but also others that I had reservation to feel hesitation regarding utilization of certain aspects of my process in degrees already understood by a variable component of this process that spoke plainly that I didn&#39;t want others harmed in regards to my writing as well as my other actions, non-actions and etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides). We that my Main Spirit Guides indicated of Earth-Based are advocating for what our Guideships indicated for us to advocate in regards to this sentence. There was already a wide range of different spiritual communications that existed in many different areas protecting physical earth-based and spiritual earth-based. The same could be said in different capacities and similar capacities regarding Space-Based. We are protected. That doesn&#39;t mean being realistic wasn&#39;t needed obviously for even what I experienced as a psychic-medium relayed experiences of nightmare proportion. Stuff that even certain legal in certain other dimensional had been ignoring for sanity sake but also to look past what was needed to understand why it was at times in this process that I operated the way I did. What was it that was needed to fully achieve what the Guardians requested that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this writing. I had got to a point where another story moment in regards to the eight, the seven and the five in a numerology flourish of narrative regarding endings and ceasefire hopefuls as well as cast of new era in what wouldn&#39;t be if not. It was a foreshadowing that existed in explanational prowess as to not lose the point in some run off adventure of better to not look the correct direction. Either way it was becoming understood and it was sure as shit understood already. Previous advocacy lamentish laminated. Another rundown of how I felt beforehand in this moment of arriving at another forsight of my death but this time something a bit different for at least on my end, and I never meant to get anyone else harmed by way of trying to look upon my death but rather was trying to find that light as well as have it be understood that that light is always supposed to be front and center at the end of my death for I am the physical in the mix and I am talking about my death, but it wasn&#39;t just about me, it was also about spiritual that wanted to traverse to that light as well as to the places guideships relayed. Transportation was one of the reasons as I realized life was a highway at times and sure as shit deserved the respect that it&#39;s name entailed but there really was spiritual traversing through lifetime lines to the end in garnering a lift upwards and sometimes downwards in the seemingly that some think in regards to certain lifetime lines. They wouldn&#39;t try to use that perception to try and fan dango an ending upon in which wasn&#39;t supposed to be now would they. I had hoped not, for I was the good. Somehow the piss and moan of not being able to handle a certain inflection upon my writing couldn&#39;t be the piss poor excuse for me letting know of the baselines to some of what I was aware. Some of which pertained to the fact of the kinds of heavenly existences in a can that was actually evermore lasting that it&#39;s name already relayed. Really having to do with not being harmed and not wanting to be harmed. No silent variable for not having spoken deserves to be misunderstood.  <br><br></div>
