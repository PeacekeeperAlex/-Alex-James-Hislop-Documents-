<div class="title">(10/08/2020)</div>
<div class="content"><br>Activity:<br><br>Felt sleepy yesterday, went to sleep around 6pm and woke up at 9pm. I remember powerful story moments coming around me. <br><br>I woke up today in the morning. I remembered certain kind placing a really itchy other-dimensional upon my head in which so said he got healed up quickly but I felt uncomfortable about the interaction and it felt like certain kind were trying to attack but I think. I smoked and it healed the head are in a certain manner. Again orange and green storyline seen in which with the other colour storylines running a bit wild yesterday during moments of gatherings around me and advocations done in regards to Story Coordinators. There was speech from the devil yesterday, multiple speeches and I found some of them to be inspirational and other kinds scared the shit out of me. I don&#39;t remember it physically but I feel that I noted some of them spiritually. The devil heard out by many and it reminded of a connecting moment earlier on. I do feel like there is a great many good spiritual around certain aspects of the devil and sometimes it&#39;s a safeguard. There are many the worship the devil and some of them in moral capacity. I feel God and even societal in a certain context have provided opportunities and experiences in which have satiated but sometimes there is more too it than just entertainment. I didn&#39;t know what the Good could do for the Devil in ways in which he found satisfying. The day before I wanted write, What did the Devil Say?, but I was scared. Maybe that&#39;s the point. I am scared others too for it wasn&#39;t just the devil and some of might never know how much he actually helped Earth especially upon certain contact which is why I do support Good trying to protect local bad. I am a moral person but I figured out today that I know who I want to be. Anti-Camp, Gaming and House decent in the manners that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and I sometimes have difficulty in certain situations. I want the Good to know that I do care but I operate in a certain fashion and it doesn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t want help in certain moments but rather an understanding that there is a classic in the Good trying to help the Bad. What should be understood is that there has been facilitation and utilization from other spiritual in which has facilitated decent interaction with some of the darker types. Some of it wasn&#39;t in regards to the decent regarding some of the Anti-Camps and other kinds of that nature but also ones of different nature. I felt certain kinds of Earth-Based story villainy upon me but in decent manner, maybe to discuss matters and sometimes less to do with being bad for what&#39;s acceptable. Some of this is done in fashions on my end at times to still keep the repour and sometimes some are not allowed to go further in certain depiction and portrayal and sometimes that kind of look is being utilized by certain kind of darker type. It&#39;s a real interaction that exists and can help story. Some wanted to let know that they don&#39;t mean to offend in regards to certain depiction for portions if not strong enough for what the real character of some choose to be, but sometimes the softer portrayal lent towards saving the bad as well as more hardcore let knows. There was notes of Magic storylines and other kinds related to magic depiction within Earth-Based filmaking. Healing happening with some decent thoughts lending and impact moments creating options for story on Earth-Based. It&#39;s seemed to be some working through storylines and situating at times but also quality of life increase for some of the Characters on Earth-Based. It seemed like some of the villains were gravitated towards me in a certain and one of the understandings that should be said is also the amount of dimensional and spiritual involved in regards to the Characters regarding Earth-based. I felt consultation in regards to facilitation of ways of life. Rights Activism for Story Characters and those pursuing life regarding some of the Story Characters. There was realism in the mix in multiple manners and I think some were requesting more realism in regards to some of the story on Earth-Based for what was requested from some of the Characters on Earth-Based, like Sid from Toy Story experiencing those energies similar to realism Teenager culture especially impressions in which remind of smoking weed and cigarette smoking. Lampwick being able to experience the forms he requested and also some of the different kinds of gambling experiences that realism types can provide. I am not trying to scare with some of this because it can be daunting. One of things about it was also entertainment for some in viewing certain Characters and switching up different ascetics obviously given consent. There is a portion of the Characters though living life in a certain manner in which has less to do with facilitating for entertainment for others. Both groups though being facilitated with a decent quality of life is needed. Think of it like there is a portion that are the Actors providing entertainment for spiritual and other-dimensional. Earth-Based would want them to experience desired quality of life given context and the amount of ways we can provide entertainment is fairly understood on my end while providing that quality of life. One of the things talked about too was the story in regards to some of the physicals pertaining to some of the Story in which partially emerged on this physical Earth-Based through fictional writing which doesn&#39;t mean other-dimensional and spiritual weren&#39;t involved. I feel there is a decent amount of resources and work put in to be able to help Story on this Earth and I discern there to be a place for the Local Characters in different fashions and I feel one of the biggest points that spiritual can help regarding some of this writing especially on this Diary Entry page is in trying to help those Characters less known especially regarding Earth-Based.<br><br>I woke up this morning, early. I felt an itchy other-dimensional small placed upon my head area. It looked like he made a couple dents with swelling energies happening but situating taking place beforehand and I also pursued another action, smoking a bowl in which healed behind later on outside after some of the erratic what the hell is going on here kind of back and fourth jargon. Still felt like the military was around me in a certain sense. I was protected in multiple dimensional but I felt something was over even though some reminded that I might be on these lines already in what some witnessed regarding some of the lines displayed in the morning in my backyard and the interaction that took place around 8AM onwards until I finally to the front yard to witness more conflict in a certain context even though contained and with mediation in play in which I do feel it had less to do with the naturalists but on my end some kept trying to portray that somehow some of my mediation this morning only had to do with naturalism which isn&#39;t fully the case and they might have less to do with some of the situations this morning on my end. There was tense situations n my back yard that I discerned that I tried to help with multiple explanations and advocations. Some of it having to do with changes and tough decisions to be made but also bear and grin its in which doesn&#39;t suffice for some. There was that look in regards to certain kind regarding what some of us are experiencing behind thee scenes spiritually, but the thing of it was is is that some forgot that I remember spiritual and other-dimensional getting better each time they brought up this certain kind of impressional that reminded of specific moments within my process letting know that certain spiritual are continuing to heal. This shouldn&#39;t negate that there are those fighting to survive and that there is conflict taking place whether it be having to do with that impressional or another kind that scared in orange-green fashion. The tell is that the latter had been certain kind for some of it manipulated and attacked into positions in which caused battle for the body to take place regarding certain kind. Either way it looked to be like certain societal and military on the peripherals of my process but also in the wings. Multiple intervening moments discerned. Certain kind of story spiritual of Gold coming reminding of earlier times. There was also other kinds around me too though in monitoring the situations and different kinds of interaction. Earth-Based Spiritual around in certain capacities. I felt other-dimensional under distress and I didn&#39;t know how it handle because some of it was bad but maybe not necessarily in regards to me.

What some forgot to realize is that I operate with strong emphasis in regards to self-defense, defense of my own and defense of others that my Main Spirit Guides relayed and I even clarified on my front lawn that I am not the aggressor and with the life utilization moments popping up as well when back in the house it kind of illuminated the kind of disparity regarding utilization of myself as well as other kinds too.
