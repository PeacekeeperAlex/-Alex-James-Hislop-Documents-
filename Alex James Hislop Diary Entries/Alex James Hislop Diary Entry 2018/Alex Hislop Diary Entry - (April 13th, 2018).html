Mine and others verbal and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light)  disclaimers are a part of these documents and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light), the way my Main Camp indicated in Far Away Light. My Main Camp’s Authority in Far Away Light Supersedes that of my Main Camp’s Authority in other parts of the light. My Main Camp’s Authority in the Light supersedes that of my Main Camp’s Authority outside of the light. Far Away Light can be a part of The Light the way my Main Camp indicated. When I say that “with my Main Camp’s information from Far Away Light taking precedence,” I am saying that my Main Camp’s information from Far Away Light supersedes that of my Main Camp’s information outside of Far Away Light. What my Main Camp from Far Away Light chose for me the way my Main Camp indicated from Far Away Light in regards to this paragraph and marking, I am saying and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light), as well as writing and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light)  into these documents and Etc(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light), the way my Main Camp indicated in Far Away Light. My Main Camp’s current information from Far Away Light takes precedence in regards to mine and others(defined by my main camp from Far Away Light) advocations, specifically that in which is considered to be immoral,  the way my Main Camp indicated from Far Away Light. I am advocating for the punishment that happens because of this paragraph and Etc.(defined by my main camp from Far Away Light) to be what my main camp indicated in Far Away Light. There is potentially information I put in after the Diary entry date indicated. Some of the discernment obtained could pertain to past information in which I have had and even written down before but decided to write down again. It could also pertain to new information obtained on the diary entry date. <br><br>Dreams: I remember seeing seeing people around a table, and there being almost this ominous presence of being forced to sign thing, it felt like they had black blindfolds on even though some of the imagery didn&#39;t show that. I got the impression that they were under duress and were being forced to sign things that they did not mean to sign. I also remember seeing an actress in the dream, Actor Polly Walker who I mistakenly thought was called Sarah Polly walker. I researched later on that Sarah Polly Walker was actually someone who has passed away in March of 2018, I wrote an adoration on the guest book in regards to the Obituary on Newton Country Funeral Home and Newton County Memorial Gardens. <br><br>Activity: <br><br>I went for a walk and on the way back I started to feel frequency changes. I spoke at the end of Franklin beach in the spot I have been calling Klin Platform. I have known that certain beings age differently, potentially beings are experiencing prolonged life in what seems like a short span of time to us. There is some sort of change that is happening on this planet. Spirits who have been here are either passing on to a differently life or leaving in a certain way who have been here for a certain while. I note the month to be April of 2018. I am told that it is every 4 years that this coming and going of beings happen, but I do not fully know if that&#39;s the truth. I am advocating for whatever this is to be protected, defended, healed, etc.(defined by my main camp), the way my main camp indicated. Everything happens for a reason. I look to see if these sort of event happen in 2022. I was also told that the weather systems on this planet could be bigger beings presenting how they feel, IE, Rain could be a big being presenting sadness in another dimensions, but there is also a lot of other variables as well in regards to not only weather systems but some of things that work a certain way not only within the physical but also other dimensional. I scratch my head sometimes in regards to how it all works. There is also something I have been wanting to talk about, I feel there is such a thing as certain words being placed with our physical words and symbols, in which looks differently behind the scenes in different dimension. Imagine whole sentences being placed in our words, and whole pages of texts within a single sentence as with whole books potentially being able to be shoehorned in our physical writing as we write not only in the physical by way of ink, pencil, etc. but also in the digital as well. My experiences confirm that this is the case which also corresponds with reading and communication which may also affect those wording behind the words. Imagine have something embedded in written word that when we read it out loud says something when we communicate it. I started a Wikipedia account to be able to edit different pages in the hopes that I could help. I am asking that the mechanisms involved in regards to my writing be raised vibrationally the way my main camp indicated. This doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t think there is good things be written in the lower planes, it just seems to me that it may be more difficult the lower down you go. I think vibration does affect this sort of thing. I figured I could help by way of many different behind the scenes wordings in which I am advocating for what my main camp chose for me to advocate for, the way my main camp indicated in the light. <br><br>My and others(defined by my main camp) defensive List Add-ons:<br><br>Those affected by my lack of appendix<br>Those affected by my appendicitis<br>The generations that pass by around me, those who live shorter life spans than my own. <br>The generations that pass by around me, those who live longer life spans than my own. <br>Polly Walker<br>Sarah Polly Walker (Different person than Polly walker)<br>Lucy Lawless<br>Tia Carrere<br>Steve Pankow<br>Four A miniatures<br><br>I and others(defined by my Main Camp) are playing the cards that my Main Camp indicated in the moments that my Main Camp indicated especially in regards to the Amount of Times I have been stabbed in the Back Defensive Card to Defend behind our Backs, etc.(defined by my Main Camp) the way my Main Camp indicated.
