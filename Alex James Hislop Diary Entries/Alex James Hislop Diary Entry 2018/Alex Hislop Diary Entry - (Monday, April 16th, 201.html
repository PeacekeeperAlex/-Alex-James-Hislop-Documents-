My Main Camp’s current information from Far Away Light for what they chose for the documents and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light) that my Main Camp from Far Away Light indicated takes precedence the way my Main Camp indicated from Far Away Light. Any grammatical and spelling errors in these documents and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light) can be clarified by my Main Camp’s information from far away light and should not deter from the information within these documents and etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light). My Main Camp’s current information from Far Away Light regarding mine and others(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light) documents and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light) takes precedence how my Main Camp indicated from far away light. The documents that are in play in regards to myself and others(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light)  are chosen by my Main Camp from Far Away Light. Mine and others verbal and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light)  disclaimers are a part of these documents and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light), the way my Main Camp indicated in Far Away Light. My Main Camp’s Authority in Far Away Light Supersedes that of my Main Camp’s Authority in other parts of the light. My Main Camp’s Authority in the Light supersedes that of my Main Camp’s Authority outside of the light. Far Away Light can be a part of The Light the way my Main Camp indicated. When I say that “with my Main Camp’s information from Far Away Light taking precedence,” I am saying that my Main Camp’s information from Far Away Light supersedes that of my Main Camp’s information outside of Far Away Light. What my Main Camp from Far Away Light chose for me the way my Main Camp indicated from Far Away Light in regards to this paragraph and marking, I am saying and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light), as well as writing and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light)  into these documents and Etc(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light), the way my Main Camp indicated in Far Away Light. My Main Camp’s current information from Far Away Light takes precedence in regards to mine and others(defined by my main camp from Far Away Light) advocations, specifically that in which is considered to be immoral,  the way my Main Camp indicated from Far Away Light. I am advocating for the punishment that happens because of this paragraph and Etc.(defined by my main camp from Far Away Light) to be what my main camp indicated in Far Away Light. There is potentially information I put in after the Diary entry date indicated. Some of the discernment obtained could pertain to past information in which I have had and even written down before but decided to write down again. It could also pertain to new information obtained on the diary entry date. <br><br>Dreams:<br><br>Activity:  At the strike of midnight I was still chatting with Dice(AKA silver noble). I wrote tstifications in regards to steam, my steam friends, silver noble, sauce, TheHeroBill, Jim Bartus, James Bartus(association first name) , Linda Bartus, Jim Bartus, Lisa Bartus. Alesha Dishneau, JoshDishneau and others(defied by my main camp) as well as writing a testifications for other members of his family. There  was a lot of turbulence that happened. Things escalated a bit and I got upset that my immorality was being brought up yet again, the amount of shit that me, my counterparts, interpersonal, and even allpersonal, as well as their close families and close friends have been through in regards to some of the slander and lies that have been specifically in regards to some of the things that is said in which we didn&#39;t do. I have done al ot of things I feel in the past to make up for the immorality in which I have promoted and I feel that that might be the case for most spirits, but I felt that the time was necessary for me to clarify a lot of things in which I did in regards to my immorality . I am sorry to those I have harmed. I wish I could take it back. I don&#39;t even remember what I did previous to 1991, November 22nd. I have a difficult time identifying some of the immorality I have promoted down here as Alex James Hislop. There was a lot of things said that I did and A lot of things said that I didn&#39;t do and I am advocating for my main camp&#39;s clarifications from far away light regarding this paragraph the way my main camp indicated, specifically in regards to things I have done to make up for in regards to my immorality promotion. There was more turbulence when I woke up today. I was feeling upset and I got angry, I felt like certain spirit and etc.(defined by my main camp), were hurting without any justification in which I still feel is true. Miscellathen, Gamifian, and etc.(defined by my main camp), can you display what my main camp indicated in regards to this paragraph, the way my main camp indicated, which does included when my main camp indicated. My main camp&#39;s information from far away light takes precedence. I said that certain ring leaders working against me were fools because of promoting immorality,  I insinuated to be in a leadership position and promote immorality made certain spirits look foolish. While I also did a bit of a let know to certain spirits that that belief and opinion does exist and  I am saying now that spirits who hold that opinion, or any opinion shouldn&#39;t be harmed, even those who hold no opinion shouldn&#39;t be harmed. I am sorry, I didn&#39;t to insult those who promote immorality and on behalf of my counterparts and others(defined by my main camp), I am sorry, I apologize. I didn&#39;t mean to insult, anger or upset. I don&#39;t believe that those who promote immorality are fools specifically those in a leadership position, specifically those in a leadership position working against me, I love all of you and I don&#39;t understand why you work against me or harm my family and friends.  <br><br>Think of it in regards to yourself. The fact that spirits tried to manipulate and influence spirits into manipulating and influencing me is evident, and the holding me in certain dimensional isolation is not working specifically when it did not achieve the brimstone that was desired, specifically when that brimstone was not desired, not truly. Yet again, there was a lot of spirit who got harmed over this stuff and it shouldn&#39;t have been. You can call it a hissy fit from myself but it becomes difficult to say that when the amount of things that happen behind the scenes, I call someone a name in the physical, a bunch of things by others spirits, specifically when it&#39;s those working against me trying to turn it into something it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s like when I get embarrassed and certain spirits embarrass those in the emotion center(AKA the gallery) to not only illicit an embarrassing emotional response from me but to also mess with other spirits as well , same happens in regards to other actions I and others do in which is destroying us. With that being said, I am not sure it warrants what has been done to me or my close family and close friends, or any who had anything to do with it. All night I played the mass retrogression playlist. it&#39;s been running the entire time and is still playing in my computer.
