The documents that are in play in regards to myself and others(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light)  are chosen by my Main Camp from Far Away Light. Mine and others verbal and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light)  disclaimers are a part of these documents and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light), the way my Main Camp indicated in Far Away Light. My Main Camp’s Authority in Far Away Light Supersedes that of my Main Camp’s Authority in other parts of the light. My Main Camp’s Authority in the Light supersedes that of my Main Camp’s Authority outside of the light. Far Away Light can be a part of The Light the way my Main Camp indicated. When I say that “with my Main Camp’s information from Far Away Light taking precedence,” I am saying that my Main Camp’s information from Far Away Light supersedes that of my Main Camp’s information outside of Far Away Light. What my Main Camp from Far Away Light chose for me the way my Main Camp indicated from Far Away Light in regards to this paragraph and marking, I am saying and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light), as well as writing and Etc.(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light)  into these documents and Etc(defined by my Main Camp from Far Away Light), the way my Main Camp indicated in Far Away Light. My Main Camp’s current information from Far Away Light takes precedence in regards to mine and others(defined by my main camp from Far Away Light) advocations, specifically that in which is considered to be immoral,  the way my Main Camp indicated from Far Away Light. I am advocating for the punishment that happens because of this paragraph and Etc.(defined by my main camp from Far Away Light) to be what my main camp indicated in Far Away Light. There is potentially information I put in after the Diary entry date indicated. Some of the discernment obtained could pertain to past information in which I have had and even written down before but decided to write down again. It could also pertain to new information obtained on the diary entry date. <br><br>Dreams: I remember watching the office(American Version) and it looked like it was a bit after the show stopped in the physical. Dwight was trying to recruit an old man for the office and he looked like he was in charge of the scene. I also saw Jim and Pam as their kids.<br><br>Activity:  I recorded a Channel Session at around midnight. It went well and I talked a bit about the certain changes that are potentially taking currently and in the near future. Specifically in regards to the every 4 - 5 years. When I woke up I had some almond beverage for breakfast. I had a conversation with my mother about some of things that happen behind the scenes, she has a difficult time with both believing that certain promotions of immorality exist and also that we are responsible at times for certain spirits actions behind the scenes, in the latter I somewhat agree depending on the circumstance. I recorded the rest of the mass retrogression issue that I started on the 4th of April, something I was procrastinating and I feel it was a complete success. <br><br>Ideas: That certain dimensional counterparts and Interpersonal, even allpersonal shift and change when certain events within life happen, IE: Birth, Puberty, Death.. I am fairly certain there is dimensional birth when a physical dies, whether that be through a shifting of dimensional counterparts or incarnation, potentially both. Me and certain spirits coined the term &quot;the caterpillar affect.&quot; Spiritual Metamorphosis.  Although this isn&#39;t new the thought did occur to me that I might have  other dimensional connections still alive in certain dimensions from past lives. I am advocating for them to be protected, defended, healed, etc.(defined by my main camp), the way my main camp indicated. <br><br>This is nothing new as well but all of my and my Allpersonal hand promptings and promptings are suppose to be done the way my main camp indicated in the light. This is written in multiple documents in which I plan on putting them online in the physical-digital if they are not already. Not to mention all of the other places this information is placed and reaffirmed on a daily, it might be a bit of a trap to accuse that this information isn&#39;t available and I am advocating for it not to be used as a trap the way my main camp indicated in the light. <br><br>Although not new, The idea occurred to me that the websites in the physical-digital are being used to display information form other dimensions. That certain websites are raised and lowered dimensional for many different purposes. <br><br>The idea occurred to me that when we look at certain places naturally, if you have a spot you look at, or even place you like to go then there might be a reason for that, a spiritual motivation in which exists not only for yourself but for others as well. The more you like that spot, could be potentially be an indicator in regards to the aspects of yourself that like that sort of thing.<br><br>That when spirits defend, the amount of backlash that certain spirits receive in regards to those chirping and otherwise is being done for a reason, maybe there is pressure in regards to certain spirits slandering and addressing those reasons as well as those back lashing. It continues on potentially rippling, also potentially escalating, not to say that there isn&#39;t worse escalations along the way. <br><br>Not a new thought but there is some inherit sadness in certain things that exist, in time differences, change, movement, loss, harm, longing, certain kinds of energy outputs, certain kinds of immorality ceasing to exist, unhappiness, sadness, anger<br><br>The idea, albeit not new, that there s links to us in many different ways, different god sparks around us that are potentially linker to us, also  setting and thing in which we have touched, even parts of ourselves that may have detached to a certain degree. I have these energies that link spirits and setting together.
