<div class="title">(02/03/2021) &quot;First Cuts&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I had seen this Space depicted as a mountain in the kind of interplay with the past that can be even off of bufferworks created in present day brought fourth and seen for the portion allotted in how the Original Creator handled those pivotal moments of first hits upon self in a certain manner. There was a wall of spiritual seen to be standing in the way in what was depicted with whispers and spoken tall true words in docu style of a fact that we had never seen anything like this before. A hardcore history style docu recap of the past where it was potentially noted on my end as to the potential that that was not where it first started. Can you imagine the spiritual realm for what it was during those first three ages for what I labelled it to be and what it looked like with eons of Peace and never any warfare or conflict. Imagine they had been working in secret by many factions before even though some didn&#39;t know in which extended back to whenever it did on situating future resolution of conflict discerned. This was a part some of the Original Creators first moves in when he finally discerned to be conflict in the looking glass and potentially before. They said that ultimately world war could be a metaphorical for stopping that first contact of harm and that the second world war could be a good metaphorical in regards to it becoming a normality. There was other metaphors too though for what was discerned in history for the great wars that it was for liberty and freedom as well as prosperity but also freedom of right not to be harmed. I had seen this mountain metaphorical in regards to this physical space put fourth in certain communicational sent and potential reveal in the past when some of these events were taking place. I felt communication with the past. I brought some of my moments to try and help and it was told that there was already a casework regarding me and I felt like I had remembered certain impressional like I would following days. I spoke about some of the past and there multiple talking points and maneuverings for what taking place. Interactions with the past, especially natural past in which I would multiple kinds of bufferworks come into play not only in present but also past and future in which would be utilized as communicational that I had seen be at times a look for the true communication that need be in which for these days did not like that to me. It looked like clear communication or at least fairly so. The tell was that as much as the circus might have been in town that it also lived up to its name in understanding direction. There was also something.<br>Some of these events were also coupled with having had enough on my end for what it might have been and what it was especially given the lens of legal and this hanging harass around even though the past two and really beforehand things did seem better on my end for what be might what truth reflects. There was moments of insinuation beforehand for years of certain form of psychic attack that was in the kind of bullying and threats as well as literal insinuation of harm upon me and my own. The kinds of insinuation was not acceptable. The scary thing is that for what others were sensing was not necessarily what I was sensing. Certain communications of insinuation masked as something else in which might have been saving me. What happens when past is brought in bright communicational crystal specifically in regards to the beginning maneuvers to prevent immorality. What does it speak of? One of the tells on my end is that I might have maneuvered, that I wasn&#39;t what some thought and that I hadn&#39;t done stuff in the past as of yet until certain moments in regards to this life and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. I had seen the tells and I had reviewed what I had been through. When I looked to the others, I knew they were more protected. They weren&#39;t involved in certain manners physical up to a certain point in regards to some of the events relayed and experienced discerned. What needed to be remembered is that this was a case of self defense, defense of ones own and others that ones own guideship relayed. It wasn&#39;t just about me but I was writing about it physically. It was one of those perception of this physical kind of off to the side. Grimey had been described but the sunshine clean existed and was again another one that was reminding of true good cultural suppression. This wall of spiritual that they showed supposedly from past had been reflected and seen in the present for what it was and the kind of show up I felt to have seen. The look was at that wall I maneuvered. Something was remembered. All Saved. Most if not all saved. 100% Safe. 100% Saved. Then the realization of most if not all saved for the point in the past for whatever it was for hope of situating what need be so it could once again be 100% saved for true if need be. I knew consent. If someone wanted to do gladitorial combat sport then that was their choice. For if harm happened that was a part of the risk. What happened though for if it was never supposed happen? What happened if it started happening for those ludas that consigned for if some did take place that harm would be more introduced safely in regards to said ludas. I had realized while typing this on the 7th, that there might be preventatives in place in the past for if something ever happened a certain realism variable kicks in and for what the Original Creator truly relayed in the first age for my diary entries and books can freely be put fourth in overlap in the way he relayed. I know who I am and it wasn&#39;t about cool. It was about something else, it was about how I felt and chose in this life. It was a marker and communication. I knew that I wanted the Tortuga to be exactly as it was relayed by my Main Spirit Guides in present time. User experience was important. The Original Creator would support me for how he felt necessary. I knew he existed. I knew he held most power. I knew he safeguarded his moral perspective and I knew he existed in present time. They say that when I typed this that there was potentially on bufferworks another first cut emerge. The stutter in regards to my life as to why at times I can&#39;t get things correct might have been involved. The cut were an indicator, it was small and painless but it was a tell and when it emerged it sometimes spoke of what need be done and I wouldn&#39;t want to say that it always told what need be done. <br><br>I didn&#39;t know why it was that the past was truly knocking on my door but I had a hunch about what it might be about given some of the tells within my life. There was bufferwork points in which I felt shouldn&#39;t be a matter of contested but rather a matter of state. <br><br>A looking glass thrown up in talks about what it was supposed to be and going to be. There was a look about it regarding past and why I chose this life. Maybe it had to do with how I found out about this life in which I do feel it might extend beyond first cuts. <br><br>Themes:<br>#WorldWarOne #FirstHits #Situated #Saved #ThreeHitsManeuvered #TheMountain #Reality #ThirdOrFourth #Gladiators #RealismKickIn #OnlyAgreedUponAndSafely #CombatSportsExist #Correct #Honesty #UpToPoint #SaveAll #SaveMost #WellIfIt&#39;sThat #FreeFormSituated #Etiquette </div>
