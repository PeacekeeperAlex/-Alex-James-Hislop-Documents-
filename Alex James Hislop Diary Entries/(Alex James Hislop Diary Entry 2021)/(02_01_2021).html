<div class="title">(02/01/2021)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>I had been learning how to live life. I realized in a moment yesterday that there was training that existed in the spirit that I could emphasize in which didn&#39;t have to do with combat training. There had been a an interplay of pursuing training in perception and mentality and as to whether that reflected in reality or not remains to be a certain scene. It just quieted the mind in a certain manner to know that there was training that didn&#39;t have to be in the direction that some had been looking and thinking. Blue Tattoos and militia clothing of Rakyat. An Ancient Good emergence. It was also in a video game for the kind of pop culture referencing that can exist transcendence. It was for me on my end a day of recreation and peace but also let knows of an archetype of Elder. There was something about living life that some didn&#39;t understand in that it could be the balance as to what I have seen me do within my life in the help it could be but also realizing the help it didn&#39;t need to be for how it manifested. There had been an argument as to whether I needed to do advocations all day with my out loud voice or create written disclaimers in which I feel does help but also the kind of style of applied to those that didn&#39;t do certain kinds of actions supposed through their life in how that could be and has been applied to those do certain actions throughout their lives. I had gotten to a point where I was tired but also the kind of damage that was done for supposedly pursuing some of those actions cross referenced with the fact that the spirit could do it much better both whether I did those actions or not. I was a mouthpiece and communicational as well as anchor at times in which in that sense was decent and important, just not to degrees that some thought. Or at least it shouldn&#39;t be given what true good facilitators of peace should be given. Some were equating me living my life to somehow not doing those actions wen life lived shouldn&#39;t reflect an unacceptability whether discerned psychically or not. Attack upon oneself for what one considers self was not considered a normality by most. There being safety and defense within acceptability made sense and those of reason understood why. It was a baseline. You didn&#39;t have to be an intellectual to understand that. The kind of meditate on your life to improve living conditions creed streamline through many actions was upon. Somehow shoehorning that attainment and given right upon specifics existent could still exist without having to encroach. I was one of those that believed that for what reality reflected and could reflect. It finally felt like a lazy sunday with the kind of healing associated at times. I knew this to be able to exist regardless of whether I did communication work with my out loud voice. I was a psychic-medium in conversation with certain portions of the spirit. I shouldn&#39;t have had to argue that a facilitating variable of peace from my own should be around me more prominently in correct manners chosen. <br><br>Later on I had realized during a basketball game a certain kind of live existed sometimes associated with fame. It was told to be less about me in a certain sense this day for what some were working on and I don&#39;t know if it was the metaphorical sense of referencing me as Earth. Maybe there was subtle inflection up to a point but for the kind of point towards as to what it was supposed to be more reflecting from the 1st age made sense as to why a reminding of peace and life as well as normality of personal actions. I knew that the true good had confronted past so as to lend credence of certain present directions. A movement of certain spiritual pulling forces away from facilitation of peace and life in regards to certain planets and societal lend prompt and reasoning as to why those good heavenly existences also becoming more close, streamlines portions of this space and especially this Earth. I wasn&#39;t the only one prompting that and regardless it was happening anyhow and with credence on the side of the Good and True good in validity of safety and defense as well as quality of life attainment, not to mention common normality made recognize of was supposed to be anyhow with legal and history to prove. I had had enough insinuation of certain kind trying to do damage by way of past interactions and future interactions for when I was a part of bringing up a point that has been brought up daily in which should be I felt way within reason to do so in reminding that the true good remembered in the past and present to safeguard the present and future. It wasn&#39;t just reminded. That was supposedly a part of some of the events these days in identifying a present point to which why as to certain things happened. Imagine present events also impacted past and present for how time can work and did work in the spirit. A famous event in present impacting ways of proceeding in the past for a question as to how that might be the case has a look upon interplay and interaction between past and present in what looks like a regular occurrence. Somehow when it wasn&#39;t just famous events for what was discerned a perceived then did the wonderment as to what was happening lend plot thickens. Imagine that it was already that masked by energies that were now changing. Either way I still noted a battle and suppression as well as clarify about what the physicals on this physical planet earth were from in that Good Spirituality and true good heavens. When I realized that those true good heavens were more a part of our lives and becoming more emphasized even with impressional not classically associated but more thought to be of middle earth and that that was taking place regardless of whether I pitched in or not, brought fourth further sense of security and peace. The Morality of a phyiscal on this planet for most when looking at a suppression of ones own spirituality chosen to be around oneself would see that to be not only an unfair variable but also a bad move. When we had pointed out what was pointed out for what needed to be pointed out, a portion of which on my end was the fact that true good and good had done more than just let know in the past to safeguard present and lend validity in moving past, I feel there were some relieved. It wasn&#39;t new either for the kind of holding it down certain spiritual had done. It extended to where it needed to and some knew if that reflected too far into past that the might be a good thing for many on this planet but also what some didn&#39;t know is that there was a regardless either way for the good and true good were upon the 3rd and the 4th. <br> <br>Late at night movement of dimensional, days before I noted green as well as other kinds forming up through dimensional infrastructure overlapping me. Again it happened last night in a rocking the boat kind of visual manner but also other kinds in the kitch and checkup from watchmen. They told that old ones were maneuvering and even the day before yesterday there was those showing to defend me as well as others supposedly. Guardians being given what they needed in which for some was the go ahead that made sense. <br><br>Movements towards the Original Creator in certain manners reflecting old creation acknowledging that they are also the Original Creator. <br>Past warnings and maneuverings by true good in the past. The way at times this process has worked, myself and others that my Main Spirit Guides indicated brought up fact of history but also that there was potentially movement in past corresponding to not only today but also yesterday and the tomorrow. <br>Changes in the past so said reflecting with correspondence in the present.  11:10, Am and Pm. <br><br> <br><br><br><br><br>Themes:<br>#FarCry3 #Raptors #Story #Recreation #Peace #GuardiansOfPeace #LivingLifeTrainging #Balance #Movement #Action #HowDoesBlueDoIt #DavidTheElder #Sports #StylesOfPlaySituated #RealityExists #HappensToBeMoreMagicRelated </div>
