<div class="title">(01/22/2021) &quot;Don&#39;t Forget&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I had felt a connection to the outside, like somehow my experiences for what I experienced had made me feel a homesick in not going outside today. It intermingled with a desire to play more video games for finally getting back online and computer repaired but it pale compared to goin on a trip outside and it reminded me of missing someone I care about after hanging out for days on end. It would only sound silly if there wasn&#39;t feelings of despair and contemplations of not wanting to be here any more to be true for I know what those feelings can pertain. I both loved being high maintenance and forgotten famous at times but despised it as well for the alienation of work that is put fourth. I wanted to ask why it was the work tat it seemed and what did it mean. Imagine a street getting cleaned up when I walked by and I didn&#39;t what it meant if i didn&#39;t walk past that street again for I thought it should be cleaned up anyway regardless. Most of the streets were already clean anyhow for a different kind of observation that has been noted in the good having been here before moving past. Someone was leaving me I think. I didn&#39;t know why it had to be this way for why it had to be the kind of work that they insinuated at times and why should amount of work dictate quality of life and relationships desired to be true even as far as not being able to change ones mold related. When I realized that wasn&#39;t the everything I thought it to be it made me start to wonder what exactly is? There was an interplay of family and friends yesterday, I should have brough up extreme morality in the kind of attention to detail that seems to naturally exist regarding such kind and I do feel it unfair for the company one wants to experience very well should include and does on many occasions but sometimes a name is referenced out of fear, not of fear of the name but fear of not referencing the name. I felt systems of family be utilized for the know of the feeling that I can discern in regards to when physical family is around more prominent. It also felt like some were distancing me and trying to emphasize non-psychic when I actually happen to be a psychic-medium. I want to be a psychic. I love being a psychic. I would love it more if I could experience the spirit in the ways we intended. Mutual agreement and choice. What was it that we wanted to experience of each other? Have it be cross referenced of acceptability for either side under the overhead of moral parameterworks. I guess I feel the way I do for a reason and how small of one and important one at that for it could be the difference of a satisfactory movement of action. The will to have the bright of eyes not dulled. It&#39;s this sight of detail peripheral that matters greatly in not losing hope. Systems discerned to be smaller and experienced more personally whether they were mine or not once upon a time, used in overhead interactions between larger groups of spiritual, sometimes including myself in interaction with the spirit. I sometimes felt uncomfortable but it was an interesting contrast with who I know myself to be, caring and compassionate, more of a love than a fighter. That common knowledge of respect for what one wants and desires as well as what I wanted and desired. I had a more beautiful physical form that what some thought reality reflected for what reality truly reflected was more in the direction of what I intended. Really from what I can identify it extends to that first day this past week going to Newmarket and whatever the hell happened. I remember there was a partial inner feelings vented in good manner captured by good in letting know of how I felt about female and what I wanted wanted to do as well as chose to do. Some of it was less refined in how I felt and more primal and what was brilliant about it in understanding what female want for many is that I might have been the average in understanding desire. Inner feeling channelings thought to usually be reserved for during acts of sensual intimacy creating a link of energy exchange letting know of how I felt but also other kinds of energy exchanges thought to in the same realm of topic. There was a similar metaphorical that says the love IQ of many was what some had hoped for and in truth reflect didn&#39;t disappoint. <br><br>There was many with a relationship with the spirit. Each person had a relationships with the spirit but there were some who pursued that in different ways. We on this physical planet had a baseline understanding what the opposite sex had desired in a ballpark estimate sort of way for some. For some were different both in what they wanted as well as what they discerned what others had wanted. Imagine billions of spiritual in relationship with a physical and in how it can look and feel be just as profitable spiritually as it is with other dimensional. As has been said spiritual wealth isn&#39;t always about monetaries and classically from certain spiritualists when referencing spiritual wealth it has been equated at times to the success of the pursuit of happiness in which can include contentment. I had wondered if there was programs that helped people and spiritual with that kind of spiritual wealth especially those that have been in conflict specifically in safeguarding others pursuit of happiness. What does the relationship of physicals with the spirit on this planet look like and what is the normality regarding. Some emphasis a relationship more akin to boyfriend and girlfriend as well as husband and wife and only focus on that kind of relationship with the spirit. The way I am looking at it from a certain angle a part of the look has been a single physical in interaction with spirit subconsciously but also through life, an inflection and expression upon the face area of a physical not fully meaning to do that expression and I in knowing there is spiritual implantation of expression upon physical sometimes by that physicals other selves has a certain spiritual facilitate interaction between the a specific relationship with the spirit and that physical. Some of it is certain aspects of that physical operating through that physical in pursuing relationships of the spirit. For some there are those only pursue one relationship with the spirit in a certain sense. When we physical relationships and know there is spiritual interaction regarding and a facilitation of energies regarding relationships physicals are in with physicals knowing that the spirit is very much a part of that is decent and can be set at times to be fully facilitated by those physicals own selves in which remedies the problematic look from some that would want it more personal and private but also understanding that there is family in the spirit of those physicals that facilitate in which those physicals would be comfortable with. For when there is a husband and wife who interact with eachother there happens to be family playing the part of some of those energies but are also a part of that relationship for some should consent be given. Even when the husband goes to work it might be an interaction more reflecting of him speaking to his wife in a certain sense depending on who is even in some of the observations in pop culture does it reflect this, like a boss and an employee fighting like an old married couple maybe more literal to some of the interactions given if both are married as well as regardless in how some of them pursue life and what kind of relationships with the spirit they have. Spiritual Relationships not involving physicals sometimes have physical Conduits as well in which bring fourth spiritual interactions upon physical more reflecting of spirits in a relationship less to do with those physicals has been a part of physical interaction at times as well as. <br><br>I had noted there was spiritually that sometimes manipulated certain kinds of relationships and goaded certain responses especially from male in antagonization and creating alienation with female. I disliked this certain kind of manipulation because it went against the grain as to who I truly was. I could see a part of my anger and compared it to classic earth-based anger archetypes.<br><br>Wokred through older diary entries.<br><br>Teaching, Gaming, Healing, Survival, Music, Film, Media, Sports, Defense, <br><br>Themes:<br>#Hobbits #Physical #Elves #Spiritual #Romance #Form #Aestethic #HowOneWantsToLook #Related #HowOneWantsToFeel #Levels #OfAffect #LighterCompromizes #Focus #StillMatters #QualityOfLifeFacilitationWhileWorking #InTheClouds #Aware #Relationships #</div>
