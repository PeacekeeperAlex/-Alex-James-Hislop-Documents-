<div class="title">(01/13/2021) &quot;Spiritual Guideship&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Gaming experiences early this morning on a segway from yesterday in a certain manner have left me speechless at times. The storylines I had seen in symbolism happened to strike a chord within me. The gaming world of this particular video game did scare me in a certain barbarian kind of manner and the subtle synchronicity made me feel hope in a certain direction. I had loved the movies in which was connected and although there was a heart wrench upon some of my experiences in how I felt some of the symbolism upon certain storylines I would come across, there happened to be a knowledge of truth that existed in which was being seen enacted, constructed and manifested in front of my very sight and live. It wasn&#39;t to take two steps back upon the one. How is it that the unyielding had been so recognized as to why those steps forward were not steps back. In recognizing which ones of unyielding direction were true in not garnering steps back, made it an interesting contrast of those proceeding in different directions that both agreed that most if not all should be able to experience a quality of life. I found there to be poetic symbolism in the pursuit of happiness in understanding that there are strong man lifestyles that exist akin to galdiatorial that some in my physical earth-based would recognize and are even form for some of them. <br><br> There is those that will go far in protecting their own especially their own family and that is a classic way of life trait that exists on Earth.<br>there had been this clarification of other ways of life at times in which some felt the need to continue to let know that there is such a thing as gladiators but other kinds too only up to a point for how the good facilitate in a certain manner in which some looked around and said that would. Combat sports existed and I didn&#39;t want t go into some of the other stuff that exists too and in how the god could facilitate as such was sufficient enough in many different means. What I felt though in what needed to be emphasized as well in what others let know of in which manifested upon me in obvious how did i not feel that way already fashion was that the way of life of family being protected was prime.<br><br>We wanted to thank Guideship on this planet more prominently with our out loud voices and at times we relied on some of the Spiritualists and those involved in Faith upon some of their actions as it was still an important worth noting but it was also understood within some of these ways of life that there was heaven within our daily lives that we didn&#39;t fully know we understood more evidently than what we thought was noted throughout our lives. For what we considered ourselves to be, did have an awareness both conscious and unconsciously in the kind of spiritual selves and overlap in the mix. Upon further understanding another point we made clear is that we wanted them to be experiencing quality of life and it was known that they are experiencing quality of life. There was at times a darker side of this for some in that earlier considerment for the kinds of life being lived and beset of something more against our nature of love and peace even though it was getting better everyday for in the kinds of events this generation partially witnessed. Raising of vibration and rising of frequency did not denote that there were other events a part of what was being labelled as the event. There was a streamline natural belief and feeling that heaven was all powerful and that it maneuvered past politics for true. I think Guideship was a large part of why we were blessed with the culture and spirituality of what we are from more graceful than what it might have been without. Guidance spoke of family and so did loved ones in which upon some of the insinuations of heroism need be involved in some of the conflict discerned regarding Guideship had reminded of old ages that made sense given what history reflected. When it stopped reminding of old, I had wondered if their was those in the past trained in ways better that taught those of today how to maneuver without causing harm within the confines of battle. Angelic streamline that spoke of outclassing any morsel of unwanted experiences classically depicted within conflict. I wanted to ask the past what they would do in scenario if there happened to be a conflict arisen and the answer given I feel would be swift maneuvering of situating that spoke to the creeds that I was employing. My Guideship knew my dream and the dream of many others that synergized way more than what some knew. It was an instant compassion with more focus on remedy afterwards than on the actual movement of saving than some would admit for only if it were true in the kind of wonderment thanks that existed for such maneuvering. It was a worship worth. Maybe it would be the backdrop of such action while healing ourselves with living good life. Guideship spoke of direction and many knew that that answer even if traversed past would always sought so I found it difficult to believe that somehow that way of proceeding only existed up above especially given logic and statistics. Maybe that context of understanding that there was conflict at times that had taken place spiritually and that there was guardians of guideship that for true was some of the strongest. I had pointed something out in the incredulity of some of the situations and experience discernment that there was mostly innocent people on this planet regardless of if some of them had to defensive maneuver or not in which something similar could be said about some of the spiritual aspects too. The look of agents and bondsmen in secret as well as not really only went so far in the kind of matrix uploads and close to forced training in the have to stay fit kind of world it wasn&#39;t supposed to be and even fighting that line trying to make some of us something we were not or didn&#39;t want to be while acknowledgment ringing of some of the events past didn&#39;t change truth in having to maneuver the way some of us did but rather emphasized why some of us maneuvered the way we did. There was groups reminded daily by Guideship that they were considered a certain kind of innocent that would be living their lives maybe more similarly to how physicals on this planet were living had it not been for aggression. Where wonder meant in the cover of night time and wikipage restricted no where nears to be acceptable enough not to form up. We wiki wondered where those quick actional in front of the scenes might have been for the kind of true direction that should be rightfully deployed on this planet. An Old God walks by and situates for if there was something dark behind the scenes but he situates in such a manner as we wouldn&#39;t be able to see for the instant does have a speed back to rights attainment creed. Rights worth salt and encroachment dealt with in ways worth living. <br><br>st symbolism <br><br>I had noted suppression of identity of self in regards to myself as of late, past couple days but really it has been more than that. There has also been a suppression of History in which regarding either points I feel is not as prominent as what perception is leading to believe. <br><br>The Sporting I had watched today kind of felt muted on my and maybe it was a certain style of play. I had felt tones of morality and sports intermingling. Maybe it was uncovering what needed to be uncovered. I had loved one of the moments which might have been a cultural backlash at least from the perspective of the bruiser but it was a sports professionalism in a fight that broke out that I thought amazing and great to see but it was also partly the reason why I had loved to see it was a perception on my end of utilization that had played upon own perception that potentially highlighted a certain kind of culture that scared me and that I felt away from in regards to direction. Even that thought to be true upon reflection felt to be well maneuvered in correct directions and might not have been the problem for what some were trying identify as the problem. I had seen the conversation and changes within the sports in a small manner but I had wondered if there was more too it in moving away from fighting and focusing more on other game mechanics.
