<div class="title">(01/23/2021)</div>
<div class="content">Activity: I went for a walk in the morning and understood that there was moments where going for walks helped certain aspects of the spirit. There had been an interplay noted at times and I had wonder if it reflected in my own home spiritually. A spiritual maneuvering at the end of my street shouldn&#39;t affect my home but I feel at times it has but maybe less than what has been expected given the special circumstances I have seen within my life through the psychic experiences noted. I have known there to be multiple overlaps that i can discern in regards to physical and there had been tells of such earlier in the week when I had taken a bus to the city. I had noted on numerous occasions where the overlap would change, sometimes in what classic perception might label certain dimensional movement and sometimes in a digital manner.  I would note that sometimes it was on my side of the screen per say but sometimes I would note it to be more related to what others would sense more prominently as some of it goes over there head in a fashion. Spiritually speaking there are physicals that are sensing some of the changes as their is more awareness to physical than what some give credit but it only goes so far. I needed to relay some what I needed to relay. Some of it included the dimensional science that I was observing as an experiencer. I knew that the reliance within certain systems of play for a certain portion always fell back on some of the primes even if in and of itself it was a of a prime more shaped in the way that it was perceived. Reality existed. On this walk I had seen some of my own innocence in how I want to operate, the kind of inspiration I remember soul wise for myself to be but another scary along this journey has been not knowing if some of the channel through are other selves, my intuition tells me that portion is in a certain sense. I could still sense certain spiritual in need and to sense that didn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t safety given the kinds of ways the spirit can relay itself. I had noted themes of who I am and what my soul pertains towards within the past week, a coming of age was another theme even though still with my parents at 29, understood that a transcendence of that made clear. What did they experience did ring in my ears at times. I wanted it to be that good spirituality that spoke of new age. <br><br>Good that facilitate a lot of decent to then pull the rug upon certain kind going the way they do. It felt like something was happening regarding this kind of line in a certain sense. <br><br>There was a look that had happened that relays a culture of trying to help and subtle shake the tree but truly trying to help in a certain sports bus kind of way. There is an impressional reminding of the music of toy story but also a certain crowd and famous reminding of tan and beige. The Big Chill. Reminds of a normality and sensible as well as middle aged cool. <br><br>I had noted suppression of actions as well as suppression of interaction this day with notes of a lot of good things supposedly. Interplay between knowing what is happening in a more evident sense as well as seemingly not so but also talks of safety and danger regarding either styles. It wasn&#39;t just the past five days in which I had noted a certain direction of more peaceful interaction but rather a direction that seemed to also have been suppressed after the first week in which might have been making rounds. Imagine a spiritual interaction being place upon someone in which is supposed to be there longer than the first week of the new be maneuvered and then said to have to facilitate certain kind in which wasn&#39;t on the itinerary, I am not certain if that was truth with what happened but I did notice a reemergence of this kind of direction this last week. Which really does have something to do with the battle of interaction on this planet for what the physicals and spiritual want it to reflect for themselves and this planet because there is interactions from the planet observed. Imagine looking up to the sky and seeing earth guardians in maneuver or a nature based interplay taking place. It&#39;s the kind of stuff that exist spiritual for when you look to the sky but sometimes also being seen regardless of looking to the sky and there is many interactions that are understood by way of knowing and learning as well as remembrance of older spiritual languages but their is facilitation of human culture as well as animal culture and plant culture as well as insect culture in many different fashions not only upon the stratosphere of the sky. There is aspects of earth that are involved in regards to conflict that has been reported on in certain areas of earth and processes of earth. This kind of truth extends obviously beyond earth-based as well. <br><br>Physical Human impact on earth and the solar star system. What does the physicals planets in this solar star system and the Sun within this Solar Star System feel about the spiritual that Earth-Based unified indicated in the Light? <br><br>I had noted healing taking place in my process with some trying to utilize my process as some sort of healing staging area in which I somewhat disliked certain aspects as I felt my direction was different in a certain manner. Regardless we saw the merit in regards to certain kind being given what they needed in which healed ways of operating that reflected truth in healing for how much better it can all be. That spiritual respond better when given what they need for true in quality of life desired within moral parameter. There has been discussion in how there is many moral parameters that include 420 inclinations and that for some of them it&#39;s not just in regards to certain aesthetic of 420 inclinations in which can be considered 420 inclinations, like Angels eating where the food was created without any harm upon others. How many times has there been lobbying and choosings from earth-based in directions that reflect a remedy upon some of the bad things in regards to 420 inclinations. Again this kind of truth extends beyond earth-based as well as there are many others that have lobbied and chose in similar directions. Sometimes even criminal element in not wanting to do the things they did by way of having real viable alternatives in ways of life facilitation ways of facilitation without anyone getting harmed, near as good if not better than the real thing. <br><br>Themes:<br>#History #Data #References #Remedy #Truth</div>
