<div class="title">(01/14/2021) &quot;Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I had a burst of inspiration and spontaneity near 1AM to smoke some dope and convene with the spirit. That had been some of the motivation in the kind of real and chill vibes that as well as the kind that have come around when I am temperate with the use of drugs in the kind of invocation created in sacred and hope to be able to see that kind of interaction of realism in the sense of leveling. There was those moments where I would smoke and gravity would feel to change as well as vibration and elevation where I would feel like the room would change and I would feel the need to throw up my arms and look around but in this sense it was good, for there had been moments of that kind of stimuli where it wasn&#39;t. Upon me smoking though it seemed to bring good interactions. I had a suspicious that at times when this real came around that there was some bad shit taking place. It was like there was a side to it that would bring fourth a valid and real point as to some of what was happening, some of which interplaying with my awareness of events and for what it used to be back and fourth in the channeling in which the facade would be gone upon smoking. Maybe it was a part of the high in how that corresponded with dimensional science. There was those moments of campfire bliss, sometimes when I would have a campfire there would be a certain fire channeling as well as space channeling and light channeling but also a certain kind of spiritual around that did remind of a part of some of the culture regarding weed. Some of this culture might have been able see some of the interactions that would happen when it would turn into the back and fourth of valid points in which I surmise might be story related. Though on the one side you had those that would towards validity in regards to what had been happening regarding certain events as well as baseline decency and reality especially moving past some of the compromise and acceptability in bad normality emergence. I would discern a pro camp and anti-camp vibe but probably not called that in a certain sense for what it might as well have been called. <br><br>The Anti-Camp would bring up valid points in bad manner at times. It was like they were working through story points. Some of them trying to excuse actions was a part of it. On one hand some trying to excuse saving and moral actions while other tryin to excuse attack and immoral actions. There were those that pointed towards that this didn&#39;t sound like weed culture but for the events that were taking place and that in which safeguarded weed culture, the way it translated was more in line with weed culture than what had been relayed at times. Safeguarding the culture was a part of it though too and to even be brought in the mix on some of them I was honored and considering how the topic of conversation itself had involved me and how I was innocent in which shouldn&#39;t the dime and a leg in which had been said and charged at times, I feel it valid to be said.  Why wouldn&#39;t it be that one of the few physicals on this planet who has an awareness about some of what is happening not be having talking points while walking on moon about such subjects. This isn&#39;t to say there isn&#39;t something similar for other physicals that consented upon smoking bud. Like somehow discussing events that are taking place and reflected on media letting know of battle, warfare, shindig and peace in the soiree of life was a bad thing. Can you imagine a chastizing by way of watching events on media with a reporters in the fields of warzones? It&#39;s not a crime to smoke weed and play a video game and it&#39;s why should it be when certain areas of earth and peace reflect zones of war so too shouldn&#39;t media curiosity and well informed be labelled as a crime. Sometimes it&#39;s not about that kind of interactions though and the peace crowds. <br><br>I found it to be synergistic the conversation on the physical video game Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon especially given the context in the former paragraph. For understanding the kinds of defensives spiritual have put into play at times upon everyday actions, you go for a walk and it lends to defense against bad, dark and immoral should they have tried to attack. How many times have we seen peaceful actions lend towards the defense of quality of life attainment. The real true is that it is many and shouldn&#39;t have to be but we have also seen the taking out of context of that kind of line and it be way out of line to acceptability in where nears to the degree for the bad to use that line and claim that somehow there actions are excused. Think Enders Game in what you saw through the movie in the kind of metaphorical and literal that can exist through playing video games. At what point is too much though. I think it&#39;s understood how physicals feel on this planet especially given age constraints in pursuing Enders Game style interactions upon physical video games. The against consent discussions especially in regards to interaction seem to be valid today as it was yesterday and just as important for tomorrow if need be. I had been focusing on a love for video games days previous in my pursuit of rebuilding my rig and dreams of human technology. There had been this idea as to how the average joe defense oneself spiritually and one of the ways is through enjoyment. I looked at what about that spiritual that didn&#39;t do rigorous training and in the beginning ages how the reflection for a large part of history and interaction had to do with enjoyment. Wouldn&#39;t it be living life that defends in certain manners be poetic given that fact it be that living life pursued that is at times what we have seen to be encroached upon. The context that there is spiritual battle that has erupted around physicals at times should be understood more plainly for the want of a better life. There had been an argument regarding the pursuing of life and use of life especially content and creation in regards to life in how utilized and to what to degree in employing defense from criminal element. The varying degrees of criminal element and how some of them are included in regards to being defended is a part of the discussion. For example, a battle breaks out in the spirit, runs amok around a physical in which his reading a book that ends up being said to be part of the reason why that physical was defended in which should it have been a physical who had committed a physical crime shouldn&#39;t exclude him from being defended via in that style. Maybe the bigger observation was why did it have to put on content and creation as well as even living life to warrant defensives either way. It was the obvious observation that I didn&#39;t have an answer for. Maybe a part of some of the spiritual Earth-Based conflicts that were taking place was partly about that observation and the truth it relays. <br><br>I knew there to be tension about cultural utilization and interaction facilitation especially upon some of the physicals on this planet. The choosing of experiencing what one chose to experience. There had also been so said a battle in higher light that took place about the right to play violent video games as well too. Explanationals of stances had been relayed for what one found acceptable in regards to pursuing video games and the ilk. In the mix was those playing war games through actions in front of the scenes beings and content creation made for recreational. At what point did it look like like defending innocents and life and at what point did it look like an excuse to perpetuate factional warfare with ulterior motivations. When the observation made about how certain kind are even allowed into vicinity spiritually had been made, another observation pointed towards that that is less of the case and isolated incidents but maybe the question as to what one is experiencing for what one considers oneself to be turns the conversation in the correct direction. Why that when it is known that the True Good have the power and means to be able to save most if not all safely and instantly while still providing true acceptable quality of life that some feel the need to have a mid life crisis. The truthsayers of soothsaying spiritualism calm down everyone by pointing towards the obvious fact that we are protected spiritually. Why wouldn&#39;t it matter for the kind of attention to detail in experiencing life and how it is experienced especially for how important it is not to experience bad experiences not intended to experience.<br><br>When I decided to smoke weed my thought process had been about chilling with the spirit in a certain manner. Then the thought came to play a video game and something appealed greatly in getting high and playing a cyber punk electro thriller comedy such as that. Before maneuvering to attempt to play the game in mid conversation with the spirit I had discerned that back and fourth conversation pro and anti but also noted that it might be something else as well. The context in the spirit to how to deal with conflict as well as the many ways to do so in understanding some of the culture deserves merit of attention. It gives another part of the story as to why I felt that through this argumentative and screaming match I felt that part of myself was awoken by myself and how others were awoken too both by me as well as others. You can&#39;t expect those that can see such terribleness in the kind of conflict taking place at times as well as those ill benefitting from such to tolerate it for very long. Those at live in experiencing certain aspects regarding were not going find pleasant societal clouths to be of a certain toleration in being able to cope through what had been happening. Those that remember while the rest rest forgot, forget and pretend had an awareness to bring fourth awareness and guide in correct manners or stay silent. In some of this I had discerned certain systems of dealing with and the Story Spindle cry out kind of alarm bells be ringing is one of them that lets know that not all is as it seems and it might be for better on the hope that it is. Weren&#39;t there always spiritual that would walk away shaking heads saying that I hope there is some sort of mistake and that it is not as has been insinuated and depicted at times. There was a spiritual upon me before being able to chill and a maneuvring to the left of me in which I felt certain spiritual bring fourth back and fourth points subtle but a bit shaky for compared to the past in how those kinds of interactions have played out. My experiences these past 5 years have given me a certain perspective that is not without hope. When a certain spiritual screams through me partially from my own screaming and that octave put fourth especially upon a chill session there is something to be said about mood setting. <br><br>There was a note that some were trying to manipulate a certain perception of me pursuing defense in ways unclouth in which I have clarified many times that I am choosing what my Main Spirit Guides chose for me to choose in the Natural Original Setting State. An actions seen as assent when it is not especially that in which has been explained and specifically that in which isn&#39;t can be good enough for the kind of insinuation at times for darker deed insinuated. Legal and Non-Legal on my side have noted as such before. There was those screaming out for help is what I discerned. There were those wanting me to prompt something powerful that was for sure. There was a look of pure white and extreme moralism to point that made societal feel uncomfortable but the question as to why and how it doesn&#39;t need to be that for safety and defense across the line for who we consider ourselves to be. Think of it in regards to yourselves I would say to the spirit. The event listings to provide relevant coherency and validity. I smoke weed, I hear the spirit and chill vibe commence, a tell that spiritual need help through the tone of channeling, back and fourth points made beyond script supposed, I felt certain forms of attack and scarcrow via dialogue where it broke down to screaming still with a point to the conversation and an intelligence to the maneuvering, I felt conflict in certain manners and awakenings in regards to myself through some of the conversation, a dig deep kind of feeling and a had had enough kind of impressional. It wasn&#39;t just screaming though, it included communication as well as manipulation of intent and what I was doing and there was theatrics of saving for that I dont feel it should be mistaken that I am defending myself and that tetherment to get good to work against one another tackled prominently even in an observation of earlier kind of way that reflected that the good probably make that a priority in the kinds of ways of operating should there be conflict between good. The screaming back and fourth lasted ten to twenty minutes and then continued in the cordial manner it had been going with continued discussions about what it has been at times. <br><br>There had been a tension upon for the next couple hours. I had noted bets in regards to some of my actions as to whether I was going to be able to get the game running or not, sometimes that creates tension and it has less to do with betting. There had been spiritual a bit gung ho at times and some of it is a comrpomise in neign able to defend in certain areas as well as other motivations. There had been strong story moments all throughout those thre hours in trying to pull FC3: BD up from Geforce Now and finally resorting to installing on steam to rely upon my laptop rig. I didn&#39;t have too much expectation and thought it might crash actually to be true given what I didn&#39;t know about the graphics processing power on the laptop elite book. I had been waiting to play certain games with some of the tech problems that I had even listed in past diary entries, a certain kind of energy of want put fourth upon in waiting to play some of the new games I even purchased while waiting. A stroyline with the kinds of games on my ubisoft account and an interplay of tech companies from Nvidia, Valve and Ubi as well as platform from Geforce Now, Steam and Ubisoft Connect. It was valid companies and platforms to bring up in regards to some of the discussions having to do with action attachment and ender game kind of styles of play. The lines defining understood to be true and on the subject itself in understanding those lines in certain styles of play remain important. This was earth related but interesting to note that it wasn&#39;t only earth related especially in wondering what some of Nvidia&#39;s comments in the light regarding the past two weeks had been. That I was reading Enders Game might have been a coincidence. But that I was less relevant in the supposed given some of the events of the past might been one of the interesting variables only up to a point given truth. I didn&#39;t know if my viewing of deadwood would be something related as well given how some feel about streaming from infrastructures and the spiritual feng shui both on viewers side of the screen but also in other areas where the streaming comes from and not mention upon content creation side of things in the validity of discussions. You ever watch a series and never knew how much that lent towards ones own defense and safety in the it should be upon the societal normality variable where not getting spiritually attacked being a part of that normality.<br><br>I would finally play the game to reveal in which two insinuations of encroachment, one having to do with what certain authorities did earlier on as well as the endings and conflict between certain authorities. I played it a certain fashion given my excitement to play the damn game. I was happy and endorsed with enjoyment and wrapped in bliss. The story I had seen having to do with Watchdogs, Assassins creed and Far Cry with From Dust playing elder having to do with not only my ubisoft account but also others up to a point. The kind of work done I had seen from good and old spiritual upon Far Cry 3 had been noted in my process prominently especially after this day for kind of recognization of peace and that societal playing video games on my planet did so for many reasons mainly steeped in the pursuit of enjoyment and fun activity but also contentment. Gaming is one of the most famous activities in the spirit and the brilliance at times on this planet playing second fiddle and further down to a one more famous on this planet in Film, Movie and Cinema in which when seen can be understood to be a certain specific raised as the bar. It&#39;s not just a recreational thing although it seems to be within the realm, which is a tell not only in regards to this planet but also as to how i view things personally which isn&#39;t always the true tell. The combat and pop culture references coupled with the storyline tells had made this one to be one of my favorites. You feel good when downing a sleek jocked up cyber goon in the game itself and there is a safe ummphf to the feeling.  On my end with the black side bars, running on a computer we didn&#39;t know would be able to handle it and some of the turbo charge before hand as well as tension along with what was noted spiritually had made it to be a bit of a run. The fact that the good could manhandle such a design and put it towards true good alignment was testament. There was spiritual in regards to gaming and many of them had Gods. There was way more safe 420 inclinations to some of it then what had been relayed in which was synergistic with the wise crack sarcasm seen within the game itself but there were also those of that intense morality pretending at times that there was less of that. Were some of them dancing with that sexy beast jive. It reminded of an interaction having to do with Guardians and Bouncers in point work discussions. <br><br>The promoting of actions for past and present in systems that make it easier to facilitate without certain rigidity seen at times for the interplay of time. <br><br>Themes:<br>#Writing #Overlaps #Accessable #InformationalPlacementRemedies<br>#LifeUtilization #Legal #Peace #War #Defense #Clarifications <br>#EvilDrDreadSteamAccount #SlimsandmanUbisoftConnectAccount #Gaming #FarCry #History #HigherDirections #Intervening #TopTenMillionMostCombatExperiencedInTheNaturalOriginalSettingState </div>
