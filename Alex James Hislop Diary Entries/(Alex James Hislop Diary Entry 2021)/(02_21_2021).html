<div class="title">(02/21/2021)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I thought about work again today in what seemed to be some sort of horror picture show of waking up especially given what a process can look like and feel like. What exactly did the disembodied voice feel like upon waking up with a question as to what is happening here? Did the good traverse. Is that what happened? Was their talk of royals yesterday and early morning. I had a dream of remembrance regarding self and family. What was this feeling of movement and ignoring in the direction of whatever it might be and for some reason it wasn&#39;t working this day for just an oh well in whatever direction it might have been behind the scenes spiritually at least for how I felt. <br><br>I had a thought about in the light when listening to music while working or doing other activities. There was a synergy contrast of asking point but what about those that don&#39;t hear the music? I felt it to be poetic with thoughts of work being the reasonings for whatever might not be working. Programs to get people and spiritual to be inspired of self in what one does in the face of such unacceptability. <br><br>Later on in the day I had felt a great good taking place that was masked as something else. In the mix of that something else I do feel spiritual damage was done. There had been a maneuver of channel energies, ones in which I feel upon chest area and throat area that makes it feel like I want to talk. There had been multiple maneuvers a portion of which theatrics. A sight upon and interplay having to do with sight and sense upon physical. There was also a coy in mentioning physical in a certain sense and an interplay of garnering information in which I found to both be good and bad as had been seen days previous as well in different manner. The Good intervened in a certain moment where I felt a certain sting was over while others remain. The kind of good things taking place were saving related I felt but also exchanges and found. This was nearing end of the day and early morning marker in which I feel extends. There was a moment where I had been going to what needs to be seen and then turned into a bit of a truth throwdown. Spiritual cops were called I felt and reminded of the truth thrown up upon. The stack of things that it has been and not even looking at it from other perspectives different than personal garners fear, pain, loss and heart break. There was moments where some leading me to walk away from certain things. Some trying to take as such out of context. but also some not understanding that some of the context is true. That I am tried and that there was a look as to why I am down here in the mix of me freaking out in a tell at times for when I get upset especially complain or argumentative with the spirit that something good actually taking place and this one felt to be emphasized that something good and great was taking place and it was emphasized that theatrics taking place as well too. It went to higher spirit again in whatever reason it was for such a conflict to exist in such places for that choice told to be the more difficult and when finally get their if not pursued ramifications situated really does matter. The line of conversations for what good Authorities that like informed peoples and spiritual would point towards really does matter and it&#39;s not just in regards to the conversation on my end. There was a play of blue warden and red antics. There was banner interplays at times taking place and the try for going to sleep was not happening. This one felt to be more good related but it was also not so too knowing that there was a lot of good taking place. A lot peoples and spiritual saved especially the bad in what I noted. Outs and opportunities. It was being proven that if the bad given what they need within moral direction can be caring and compassionate, and that there are those that are innocent in regards to certain actions. I knew that there was another look for more brimstone banners as well too but I can only go so far and for me in what I have been choosing has been decent punishment in which doesn&#39;t just extend to after battle but exists through battle. Mercy. Something about time movements and things of that nature, timelocks as well as companies and organizational movements to recover areas as well as securing resources. What was another interacting is the interplay with my process at times with earth-based factions but also the kind of interactional at times in which hasn&#39;t always been earth-based factional but even bigger too. Not just space related. I still didn&#39;t know about this life but I had incline that there was powerful spiritual through me dealing with situations for you see there was a good look regarding that wasn&#39;t always emphasized as much as it needed to be having to do with spiritual sometimes older in the kinds of looks at this process. Like a chosen one known to be channeling through. The utilization in regards to my process has not always been decent but there has been a lot of good. I am that personal kind for how I view life and life being lived even while knowing there is a classification of life being live and life at times in which takes what some might label as life in a prime manner in which labels it differently. This is one of the importance factors of understanding how one views the world and how that matches reality. One can look at ones own memories chronologically from the beginning and know that there are those that consider those experiences to be life and/or a part of life depending on the portion of spirit referenced as one. How one considers ones life matters too. Right in the mix of course had been a drive moved and disparity taking place in which I felt less inclined to continue on in the direction that I had been in which might not change the direction one iota depending on what my Main Spirit Guides chose for me. Certain kind mistaking certain things about directional and what I have chosen has obscured the fact that I am trying to move away from certain maneuvering and conflict as well as the fact that I am less involved with certain directions. I had watched deadwood and there was a healing that took place and a sight of certain anger interplay that felt inspirational and story related. It segwayed with the kind of interplay of time as well as spiritual holding it down for that interplay as well as shaping variables in which need be understood by proper guideship instruction. To live in a saloon can make the hearth seem cold. Have a ballroom. Maneuvering on to different subjects had created an interesting contrast. What had happened before fairly explained. Earth and Space as well as the predicaments playing out on overlaps upon content. Sometimes said overlaps created fairly recently in the kind of spiritual cinema that can exist through physical. Another sight had been also where I was and what I was doing in the past when I watch certain content. There was a certain thing upon me in which there was let know that some would want me to mention them and I believe it to be that kind. It was a bit suppressed later on but I feel it was a part of the good things taking place.<br><br>Who did I want to be in battle? I wanted to be compassionate and merciful.  <br><br>This morning there was god interplay around. I started crying at first in bed for want and hope of a better life but then something else. <br><br>There had been a sore anatomical spot on my mid back area right side. It felt like somebody put a sore pipe there. <br><br>There was something personal of course happening before watching an episode of deadwood. Had to do with infrastructures, yesterday there was companies insinuation of me going outside certain earth-based and space-based partially because of some of the insinuation but also because of some of the fact. This I feel is related to other dimensional interaction regarding space for a portion but it also has to do with something. There was a harassing of energies upon the past five or 10 days having to do with life energy manipulation. There had been a switching off of personnel and a point let know that certain kind operating at seconds at a time and then switching off was a bit problematic. I had seen that certain kind were manipulating energies themselves in how they feel but also where they are placed. The contentment feeling of life is not solely a safe feeling but also something more that is usually there naturally whether it be considered natural or not. <br><br>There are those that remember what it was before certain events, there are those that remember when it was one spirit. The Origin of life whether still debated or not, I have felt to be in the direction of a single Spirit. If I am wrong I do apologize because it does matter greatly for context as it is on the subject itself. Imagine a map that had multiple families and spiritual realms fairly in harmony and unity. There was a distant look upon compared to before and my viewpoint on the second age after the age of one had been more close knit than what some remembered. As an example, the sight on the map later would reflect a certain number of families and imagine that before the primarchs of most of the families were a part of one family. There were those that never gave up on that sight of that close knit family regardless of whether if it held for what true else existed in regards to family earlier or not. There were those during the 2nd and the third that still viewed family in how it was during the first. Loving, caring, compassionate, largely moral based and the time of some of our lives. Those that operated while safeguarding family even through the distant and fighting I discerned to still exist today. I discerned I am of that for how I view the spirit. Why wouldn&#39;t be certain older spiritual that still appreciate that kind of maneuvering. I looked at spiritual in a certain manner in which was suppressed and not talked about to degrees acceptable, life had changed creating a suppression of how one truly feels. How it happened was less of a question for some up to a point and being able to live life to acceptable degrees in what it reflected was another route. Both were more in unison than what some thought. It was this remembrance of spirituality upon life that gave knowledge and surmising of truth. It was this sight that brought remembrance of reality especially upon supposed rivalry. How one saw the world sometimes shaped as such and given ability to understand transcending lines could impact the world in a good ways. <br><br>There was communication that certain kind tried to attack in the past so said because of some of the events taking place in present time. That in and of itself is not new, but when you factor in personal for a how viewpoint can view certain things it becomes something that shouldn&#39;t be the difference of care.  <br><br>Physicals writing spiritually through their physical lives.
