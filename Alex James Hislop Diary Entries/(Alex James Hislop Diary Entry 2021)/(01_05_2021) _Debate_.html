<div class="title">(01/05/2021) &quot;Debate&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I didn&#39;t know what the play was in regards to some of the maneuvering spiritually early morning. I had thoughts of being sectioned of from earth-based, a certain group setting the stage as well and possibly good remedying multiple aspects in regards to this process. Societal fit is what some said but at the same time it felt like it was also something else. There had been notes of scare tactics to keep certain good away from here as I had seen the past couple years here and there. A certain good spirituality seemed to scare and it was that sunshine clean and positivity that would have been a lead changing for without the regardless, a good way to remedy process interaction. It was understood though that it had less to do with what some were doing or not doing at times. The Actions and Non-Actions blamed at times for certain interaction changes spiritually didn&#39;t make sense to degrees acceptable. We worked through it in this process many times and got to the point that many already arrived at spiritually for what they could sense and discern as well as what some of them experienced.<br><br>For it wasn&#39;t just my process that there was a regardless. Violent video games were not going to be a good enough reason for some to have ones own interaction reflect interaction that one didn&#39;t want and there was good case made regarding spiritually that violent video games that being violent depiction video games and fictional violence as well as violence where no one is being harmed being perpetuated was actually a stave for some to stay away from violence as well as vent and alternative to real violence as well as what the good have done to safe guard violent video games being good enough to not be a decent reason for certain spiritual to set interaction in ways not intended especially in the direction of real violence. There was the obvious as well in which pointed towards kids and teenagers being a prime group that played video games on this planet in which spiritual interaction should reflect what their Guideships and Parents relayed for them. I had wondered if there was the information and energy that my Main Spirit Guides listed in regards to this sentence that vindicated violent video games.<br><br>It was an interesting contrast to know that some of the maneuvering to put fourth into certain bubbles of awareness and things of that nature upon earth-based at times had not been what the brochure indicated and even the maneuvering in this process seemed to be a bit of a way to impact and influence perception regarding earth-based. I thought I was moving away from that kind of thing and felt that the good were way in the mix. There had been understanding of different kinds of Concepts and Non-Concepts on this planet. A certain Meme that makes headlines in pop culture is a good example of what I am talking about. The kinds of interaction and spiritual understanding regarding that meme but also awareness to be a part of such emergence in pop culture sometimes partially defines that meme. Even if it doesn&#39;t there is still a remembrance and interaction as well as history in regards to that meme. It made me realize the power of pop culture especially in defending ones own societal. I felt that a part of these days had been rooting out bad spiritual that were trying to control and obtain power as well as maintain darker lines through our own pop culture in which comparison to the good was significantly less powerful. *Concepts and Non-Concepts interaction bubbles of History*<br> <br>It made me cringe looking at some of the things physicals on this physical planet earth potentially went through at times even if it happened to be a small percentage. Even within societal normalities and pop culture. It made me wonder about what was happening in regards to Military in a shout out back to 2020 near the end of the year, within the past week to be true. The use of ones own culture and what was happening to ones own culture especially spiritually mattered greatly. There seemed to be a spirit of awareness upon but I also discerned a spirit of legal as well as too. I knew my case in some manners was linked to the caseworks in regards to human culture on this planet and I knew that I could look towards anything on earth-based and know there was more good than bad. I could look towards anything on earth-based and know the good had created energies to safeguard that I could reference instead of if any kind of bad energies made it through persons, places and things as well as actions and non-actions on earth-based. In fact, most on earth physical were looking at it from the ways their Main Spiritual Guideships indicated and there was a physical earth-based unified in the light as well as too for the check and balance in which to be true had more to it than that. I knew there was ways that the good were maneuvering what some of the bad were doing at times, in understanding certain aspects of spiritual mechanics, that crimes on this planet were spiritual motivated at times just as a lot of the kindness and care was motivated spiritually as well in what made it seem to be a struggle. It baffled in composure for the kind of power the good in which didn&#39;t draw a comparison at times for even the Original Creator alone had enough power to save most if not all in the Natural Original Setting State. The real reasons he didn&#39;t weren&#39;t ever going to be a good enough excuse. That Earth-Based Spirituality classic in enlightenment and love, care and compassion, hope and reason spoke more truth than what some knew. That heavens really reflected as such and that people and spiritual could live their lives in ways intended within morality and peace in which did include violent video games for some. Heaven was being brought fourth on Earth in what I could discern and it was partially because of what physicals on this planet wanted. <br><br>There has been Good around the people and spiritual of Earth-Based for a long time now and will be forever but that doesn&#39;t mean there hasn&#39;t been maneuvering of good to this planet not only in the present but also in the past and god willing the future. Many on Earth-Based are grateful. It should be reiterated that people and spiritual living their lives and proceeding in the directions their Guideships indicated. What was Heavens plan for Earth? <br><br>Later on in the day I had interesting in what looked to be a black board learning and intellectual culture. Reminds of excersizing the mind and staying fit mentally upon not only the subjects of help and saving as well as the ilk but all manner other subjects too. I would love to see a book review on my own blackboard to a certain extent. There has been a culture suppressed on my end at times for that kind of work on my own blackboard ailed at times said to have only been perception related upon certain interaction. The real truth though I feel reflects is that there has been multiple kinds in the mix especially regarding saving but again also having to do with other subjects. <br><br>Themes:<br>#Construction #Logic #Green #Naturalists #DarkAestethic #Neutral #Debate #ItWasPersonal #ThenGetOutOfMyWay #SupportThePast #ClaimThePresent #TruthRelays #Awareness #ItsTheSubjectthatMyMainSpiritGuidesIndicated #Fact #GoodSpirituality #Suing #Legal #IAmInThisLifeNowAndWantToLeaveExactlyAsHowMyMainSpiritGuidesIndicated #Earth-Based #SafetyOrStealing #IfAHorrorMovieStickTogether? #Famous </div>
