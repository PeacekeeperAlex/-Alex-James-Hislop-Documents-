<div class="title">(02/02/2021)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>The interplay of dimensional at times spiritually around physicals is really fascinating.  Think of certain kinds of realism groups similar to this physical planetary human cultural that sense what they sense in which for some of them is different compared to what certain physicals sense even what regular physicals sense given anatomical normality. For example, that realism grouping might be able to sense a portion of what is upon a certain physical, but a physical is able to discern other spiritual that that realism grouping is not able to sense, even within regular anatomical like intuition and insinuation machinsisms which might be light-based as well. Why would it be so abnormal to have light in the mix given the prominency in regards to afterlife regarding light. Not only that but you think of it from a dimensional standpoint and it seems ridonkulous that the Light wouldn&#39;t be in the mix diplomatically and internationally so why wouldn&#39;t there be light-based anatomical upon physical at times. As a psychic-medium I have felt anatomical machinisms more minutely at times to gauge from experiencer perspective stimuli that gives more of a tell as to what it might be. Just because science on this planet is just starting to figure it out in ways that remind of gradual pop culture informative even with scientists in the mix, doesn&#39;t mean that the experiencers and faith groups don&#39;t already have a read on what it truly is and it&#39;s that tell of experiencers for knowing in what they experience that sometimes transcends scientific proof and lends towards a pursuit of science for it is the scientists that is the one that sometimes proves that to be true given evidence of fact. How is one to pursue a science without keeping an open mind. That speaks of stagnation in which the wild goose chase might actually be about. Imagine the scientists had to work past that in which he couldn&#39;t see to explain that in which he couldn&#39;t see. He had to be able to ascertain. Open mindedness that there could be science in the unexplainable. It was interesting that it was scientists that spoke that there was science to the unexplainable. Wouldn&#39;t it be interesting that science up above would watch science at times struggle with this. Specifically on those points that it was explained by spiritual science and that when it hadn&#39;t been explained by, often times live dimensional science of proximity, that somehow that meant a pursuit not worth. When it was sensed as a tangible, I had wondered if it that be often times the difference between pursuing. A physical scientist was approached by a physical psychic and told about an experience and at the same time he was watching physical phenomenon not fully explained by science. He walked towards that physical phenomenon and studied, learned and proved what exactly that phenomenon was and wouldn&#39;t it be interesting that there might have been more to it than what was explained in what was not sensed. For if there is spiritual science, then wouldn&#39;t that exist for that physical phenomenon. Wouldn&#39;t it be interesting that if higher selves exist, that many of them in regards to scientists explained through those teachings of explanational of physical phenomenon. That psychic still whispered in the ear of the scientists though. It should have grasped his attention more prominently these days but it was one of the cusps. <br><br>Imagine there was spiritual that chose sleep until certain variables be situated. Imagine a certain kind of attack happened where that spiritual had to be woken up early. What was this physical supposed to look like especially when some went to sleep. I did know if I was the joe in the sense that some were trying to equate or guessing as such and little did they know that the Joe was quite formidable in his own sense both with prowess of self but also in other ways too. There was still a look that somehow said that if I was the casual in regards to matters that reminded of intelligence that somehow that meant maybe there was a difference of being the Joe or not but the problem with that look is the kind of informative that already existed within certain areas of the light and the Natural Original Setting State. Another look on the casual had been about certain trainings, that might have been the difference but if said somehow the scrub that did not make the cut then might not have been enough for the difference. A debate about whether I should receive defensives given some of the tells of psychic discernment from me might have been less of a debate. Either way it shouldn&#39;t be the difference and it shouldn&#39;t have been the difference for the rights granted from the Original Creator in the past. Regardless of whether I received training or not and regardless of whether I prepared for this life or not, should not be the difference in receiving defensives from those I requested defense from. Right there too, that somehow I would need to request shouldn&#39;t be the difference for truth of reason on the given fact that it should be defense given if need be either way. If certain kind attacked and if the Good as well as the Original Creator had the power and means to be able to safeguard, then that should be freely given. I shouldn&#39;t have to work for my defense especially not to degrees insinuated. There was a freak out either way debate at times for if I was more of a pro or not in regards to this life and the look of being the joe didn&#39;t sit well with some but then again maybe it was the casual look that might have been more fierce. Some didn&#39;t want to mistake for if it was more of the joe look these days in what some were mistaking as the casual for what why no shit would there be defensives positioning in regards to some of the media reports discerned in the spirit at times. Why wouldn&#39;t the debate of other dimensional in regards to physical be so valid given if this physical had less to do with certain spiritual conflict for true. The Good on the one side was a tell for if you trace it back within histories you will find that they are on the winning side. It does extend to the save most if not all lines. It does only go so far. I had viewed myself in a certain capacity only up to a point of truth and honesty. I had felt that the Original Creator had sectioned off parts of himself and granted separate self identity and that there was old creation in which were still that identity given evolution of self only up to a point. I had viewed myself as one of those old creation because I felt it to be true and my discernment had been a large percent correct, but it didn&#39;t mean that there wasn&#39;t a possibility at least not on my end that I was something different. When that Old creation go back to that line of self and question the Original Creator as well as insinuate that they might consider themselves to be the Original Creator more prominently then what was usually seen in these modern days but also more akin to what it was back when that separate self identity was granted, then what does that mean? One of the insinuations is that some had had enough and that some had always had had enough. It was understood the prime of the Original Creator for what I considered it to be was good and moral, did want most if not all to be saved and was working towards that. Why wouldn&#39;t it get brought for if he and the good together had the power and the means to be able to save most if not all safely and instantly. We wouldn&#39;t have to see damage or attack in ways that has been see on this planet. <br><br>* Context, especially regarding that I had witnessed conflicts, dimensional movement and certain spiritual events at times turbulent for a context still needed at times. <br><br>How did the Natural Original Setting State always exist?<br><br>The Natural Setting State potentially always existed. Either Life always existed in the past or there was an Origin. <br><br>The Natural Original State Always existed. Origin Point of Life takes place. The Original Life learns. It creates. One of the primes in regards to creation was sectioning off of the Original Life and granting separate self identity  to that sectioned off part by the Original Life Prime. The Original Life Prime in the first age eventually sees calamity in the future. He prepares and prevents. Eventually he tells certain creation. They prepare and prevent. Events take place eventually. There was a portion of creation told to prepare for life in the future. The look of that life changed as certain events unfolded. The mindset and mentality in pursuing that life by a portion of that creation didn&#39;t change up to a point. A portion of that life eventually pursued. Past meets present and present remembered. Reflected upon is the old creeds for true. Old meets new. New creeds reiterated. Acceptance invoked for if the past forgotten. Memory proves combat sports existed in the past. The true winnings already won. Maintenance line thought of in comparison to something worse. AI revealed to be one of the answers. Near as good if not better than the real thing. Adaptability for present to past and past to present initiated. Wrongs righted. Further Happiness created. The Lion roared. <br><br>I noted story impact themes and event impact within the context of not fully noticing said impact from certain viewpoints.

I didn&#39;t know what was fully happening but maybe the hum gave a tell. I had wondered what sort of excuse these days that paled in comparison to having that good spirituality around more understood to be and for true. Some were at the end of their line and of course more decent to push back that mentality. <br> <br>I smoked weed at the end of the day in trying to outrun an addictive while trying to pursue the high of life especially in approachment to the spirit. An in ceremony and soiree. It was this day that I partially wrote about days later in certain events especially regarding WWI in the metaphorical that some had inflected. Life changing events would follow. An if that is what it is and a put fourth with what I have in what was potentially chosen for what my Main Spirit Guides relayed.  <br><br>Themes:<br></div>
