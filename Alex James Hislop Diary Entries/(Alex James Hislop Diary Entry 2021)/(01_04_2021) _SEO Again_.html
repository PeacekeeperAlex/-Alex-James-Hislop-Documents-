<div class="title">(01/04/2021) &quot;SEO Again&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>Brand attachment of spirituality saving, Expand* <br><br>I don&#39;t know why there was such a communication put fourth upon bullet echo.reminded of a certain moment going towards many different light finally at a point where I had certain kind of looks around that really isn&#39;t what it seems in the kind of good that are around people anyhow. Even styles of play that we&#39;re good too seemed to reflect an out of the dark aspect and found light. Why would we play games in the dark, a literal physical metaphor for if my light was actually out but maybe it was the correct metaphor given the amount of lights I went too. This day upon visiting again this game after waking near 1am and doing some spiritual discussions after a stickh about natural time and the original creator as well that good programs of action shadowing with good actions. It kind of turned into something else though and we could see the difference of rougher tone of rights activist politico discussing the truth of conflict. Not all rights activism is that way. I had three looks that I remembered right now, a video game session, a music video experience and watching a film. All three I had wondered what exactly was happening spiritual and all three were fairly decent times to experience such things even with a warning upon the movie experience. Earlier I looked in the mirror and felt certain kind listening to me. The area has reminded of ri heroes. Its also more than that though. I had asked a history check upon lines of situations and lines of conversations for the kind of look upon the true good in higher light is not meant to be mean from myself but rather something else. Nevermind that I wanted to see a past hour review as to what I experienced as well as but thee was also a certain kind of recovery succeeded and vindication relaying happening on earth based as well as extended. I wanted a history check for a reason having to do with that there always seemed to be some sort of lines to the conversation and situation but I had finally taken a look at why and wondered if it wasn&#39;t what some thought. On to the next and next as well as whatever the hell else and given the time maps and how they are seen in the Natural original setting state and the light, I felt like there was always something else and that the problem of remedying for true the nonsense of having to go to there, not even for the resources some hold in a certain regards let alone what work used to be in the second or even third but rather dealing with some vegabonds situation and what&#39;s her the heck else be in the way as to why some are not receiving assistance in times of need. It was just always something else as to the reason why and I am not saying there isn&#39;t validity but that there is a problem.<br><br>I had noted a certain kind of interaction upon me the past three days and I had seen it emerge upon me here and there as well as have noticed that it is present upon earth-based these days in multiple manners. Some of this style has had to do with branching off of certain spiritual, imagine a talking head of ethereal energy branching of to the one side of a physical who is speaking on a media platform and another one having to do with spiritual upon certain talking, imagine a flourish of spirituality upon a single word and/or sentence which is being recorded in decent fashion. Awareness and awakening are two other themes noted in regards to this phenomenon and it also safety and reassurance. <br><br>Two columns, on the left column my authorities that my Main Spirit Guides indicated and on the right column the authorities that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to the proximities that my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this sentence. I knew that many of them were good if not all of them. I had wondered what it had been like with some of the awareness upon certain spiritual including myself with truth invoked to great manner as to which authorities are which and still have certain kinds pretending to be something they weren&#39;t regarding some of those authorities. <br><br>There are certain spiritual that at times had been crafting an excuse as to the reason why there was spiritual conflict more prominently around me even if upon borrowed time and falsehood of more negative than positive experiences upon this process, but you can look towards more if not all and understand that there is more positive than negative. Literal facts. There had been a thing of crafting experiences and competition of negative discerned that really had more to do with excuses and blame as well as power. Most power resides with good and the word reflects as such. Maybe it had less to do with good or even the supposed hoodlums trying for interaction to reflect something that truth wont accept. Maybe it had to do with a lack of leadership for something referred to in a bufferworks safety of being able to write down what need be. Asking the question as to how that exactly works for my content in regards to bufferworks might have been the best question I would ask. No amount of spiritual lies would change the fact. I was glad to be walking away from certain interactions squabbling for power. The think of it in regards to yourself quite evident and clear to ring in the ears of who need be so I could get back to living the life I wanted too. There were those that didn&#39;t want to have to deal with my life later on in the kinds of things certain others would try to do with utilization regarding certain aspects of my life and memory. How is that I had known some of the scenarios and events as well as nuances in regards to what certain spiritual were doing and how at times when I was referencing spiritual that some were mistaking me referencing physical. I had known by way of experience and psychictivity played a big part regarding and the intelligence to the conversation even though changing these days on my end to a certain degree was still existent. I still speak about rights issues and talk about different subject, often times in the direction of how we can help and/or good ideas invoked. <br><br>There had been compromise at times for the instead of an outright battle and conflict that there be a facilitation down the road to situate disagreed upon matter. Battle facilitation in the spirit had been spoken about to a certain length and the shit of it was that certain kind didn&#39;t have a monopoly on battle facilitation as my own morality could facilitate as such in better ways. <br><br>On my end, I had noted battle in regards to my content which did not mean that those that did battle owned my content especially for what I was choosing in the ways that my Main Spirit Guides indicated. How personal is ones own content? A person who has a gaming channel? A person who wrote a book? An musician? A filmmaker? In regards to these diary entries that were thought of as such,  I was one of those ones in the mix, part charlotton but also part not. I write a paragraph, and certain forces are about fight over a paragraph, in which for a portion has less to do with me for certain kind of informational placement upon that was also potentially a compromise in a direction that wasn&#39;t even what my Main Spirit Guides indicated. What exactly does this have to do with the garnering of experiences and the importance of prevention given the understanding of how much it matters not to experience what one does not want to experience. Knowing that I do not want and important and powerful good authorities and non-authorities do not want people and spiritual experiencing what they do not want to experience especially in directions immoral. What have I put into play for publishers and editors as well as staff in directions of safety, defense and quality of life? This is one of those things where I shouldn&#39;t have to do work to safeguard because the societal normality variable that I am speaking on includes defense across the board and that is a normality in which doesn&#39;t include compromising in regards to getting ones own soul hurt for what one considers ones own soul to be. What does that large percentage variable of Unified in the Natural Original Setting State indicate about how the good proceed in achieving that daily? Certain spiritual had already claimed that a large reason for conflict around me had been piss poor placement of informational that I never wanted in the mix in which for some of it got cleaned up and situated before publishing. The systems I wanted to use for book publishing on my end was what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regards to this paragraph.
