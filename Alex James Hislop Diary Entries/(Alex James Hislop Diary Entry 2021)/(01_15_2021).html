<div class="title">(01/15/2021)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>More pinnacles that I discerned to be of my life these past couple days but I also feel it has been pinnacles of others lives as well. There had been something I had noted in spiritual maneuvering it what has been discerned in regards to certain processes. The way some have played it before has been that kind of style that says if events have gone a certain way then responding the way chosen proxies indicate regarding and if that happens to reflect then it might be a tell. It reminds that certain direction can continue especially if remedy is made clear. I didn&#39;t know what happened though for some when it continued along a different path even when remedy made clear multiple times and I surmised that there was points of alignment and adjustment. There had been those moments of discernment as to what exactly is happening and the ballpark estimate understood, with the different kinds of ways that can work with life path dictations and cultural bubbles that often times had such an import upon communication and non-communication made clear that there was both action and non-action taking place. I had noted pinnacles of others lives whether it be as form association depicted for what I understand it to be or not. Meaning spiritual letting know that certain people packed heavier than thought if needed be and that was a normal thing if needed to be but also that a utilization regarding if it happened to be in a certain direction of what I thought it could mean might have to do with what some are seeing happening to what some consider themselves to be. There was a care and compassion and furthermore a love in regards to certain infrastructure and systems as well as lifestyles and ways of life. I continued to espouse that that didn&#39;t need to change and others espoused that as well with different methods in how to achieve. My might have been viewed as the unviable and unrealistic when it was the true choice of heart in which I didn&#39;t accept as unreliable and unreasonable. Others working through certain systems felt there to be ways to work through. It was interesting that multiple groups still agreed in certain manners and felt that higher directions intervening in certain manners to be a correct way even with tackling within certain systems or not. I was emphasizing that and as a psychic medium there was both reasons but also manipulation of perception lending towards those reasons. Was there truth for those reasons though? What exactly were those others, Good and True Good, espousing in different directions? <br><br>This day though it felt more of the same as to the day before. I smoked again, this time less to do with chilling with the spirit and more to do with ailing my headache for my laptop troubles. Again there was argumentatives in the screaming regard but this time a smaller amount, about half the time as the day before. The lines to the conversation understood again at least for what was said on my end. What was said on others ends might be an interesting variable to know as well. Either way it gets to a point where if one feels under duress that checking if that be the case shouldn&#39;t have to be the response as there should already an understanding especially in regards to this process. They start understanding my creeds and how I proceed in which can include reputational defense but at what point does a look the other way become difficult in regards to proceeding especially regarding legal and mediation as well as ways of proceeding history. I loved some of the styles but it was also something else that reflected for when breakdown and remembrance invoked where all of a sudden ways to operate and coexist revealed the uglies in the mix  was a tell often times that those on the attack had gone too far and for if the uglies were unacceptability too harsh then were was then to go. How the hell was it fair. On the one had you had those on a certain kind of receiving strife with special buffers but on the other hand you had those that at times didn&#39;t even want to associate and still wanted to be able to live life in a normal way and when you looked at it couldn&#39;t blame them either for feeling such ways. When you go to smoke weed like some patron down on his luck at the bar you dont expect there to be a second helping of the showdown that happened the day before but in how things can work in the spirit for all the safety that exists in can sure as heck work that way. It doesn&#39;t help when the bar patron is speaking truth but somehow it doesn&#39;t just have the same ring to good enough for reason for other to receive turbulence. Wouldn&#39;t the kicker be that the patron has nothing to do with it. Maybe in this metaphorical and reality that might be the case. If it was said off this life there was also a let know of strong legal kung fu. God forbid I never incarnated into a certain grouping of dimensional beforehand. God forbid someone else never incarnated beforehand either. <br><br>The hum of my laptop changed the day for the slam down of the fist upon to quiet the mind and buzz of annoyance. Maybe I should have just let it hum all day. Either way after such gaming moments and intensity interplay of War and Peace on my end had put fourth a bit of gloom for when the laptop couldn&#39;t reboot. I remember prayers circles of spiritual around the computer with hopes of miracles in making it to the windows screen a bit dashed even with strong medicine brought fourth making prayers live up to name for when I powered off to not reboot again. It was a way better replay of the scene in the office room earlier for when the desktop crash happened earlier mid stream of a Total War Troy session. I can and should be able to let know of sensibility in regards to living life and the kind on the fritz that happens at times. It shouldn&#39;t some wargame scenario behind the scenes for the kind action attachment taking place in absurdsville nonsense. I didn&#39;t want my life to be dictated by what other spiritual were doing behind the scenes in ways which did not speak of my own culture in which shouldn&#39;t have had to not speak of my own culture but rather provided what need be so I can live my life in more decent manners. I didn&#39;t want to blame the spirit for my I.T. problems but somehow I felt there was a connection. I had moments where I laid on my bed and didn&#39;t do anything. There was those moments in life where something didn&#39;t work and it kind of changed the mood around oneself. It really was the difference at times. How much amenities and living situations dictated tone and sometimes created action and non-action. </div>
