<div class="title">(02/11/2021) &quot;Following the Line of the Conversation&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>For me it was an emphasis that I was from that good spirituality that has been depicted on earth physical. Heavenly beings manifest with experiences that always fascinated me to the core and something sometimes forgotten in the facts of where one comes from. Establishing that there were those from that kind of culture connected and made sense within the line of the conversation. Mindset and mentality to be utilized as said reasoning for not understanding those lines as to what they be for true was correlating for when one readjusted the shutter shades in which one looked from for when truth revealed it told of many innocent trying to live their lives for true whether some forgot that or not. A look of heroes even if for larger than half length of ones life true or not wasn&#39;t going to change the truen and when it was told that many heroes didn&#39;t want to have to suit up at times it wasn&#39;t in manner of disgrace and it was also in caution as to why some didn&#39;t want to reveal or speak of such things especially from household names of forever regarding a taking out of context and misunderstanding of lines. If it was the conversation that would be followed then an understanding of Origins for most heroes and specials point towards innocent with lines earlier on in which told of legality of old that could maneuver at any time given the facts of truth. Most if not all was already situated legally, technically speaking and I do not feel it was the waiting of catch up to be the reasoning especially not good enough for ability to transcend exists extending from home dimensional. There was another line I suspected in the mix in a certain rhyme these days for what my discernment told me having to do with those that emphasis normality of good and even from another note inflecting citizenry and civilian normality where a point had been suppressed and forgotten that I am from that in a certain sense. I didn&#39;t even want to mention others for how outlandish of forgotten it would be with such evident apparel known for what need be, and what was chosen. How could I go to earth to explain the regularity of occurrence in what we were being understood. At what point did an encroachment upon change minds to evidence. When did the ignoring of encroachment become the battle of normality? Maybe it was this awareness that told that it wasn&#39;t the battle of normality in which had been seen as truth for what truth needed to relay. It wouldn&#39;t ever be for the clarification that needed to be and was understood, so it happened to be about the encroachment upon normality of quality of life in which didn&#39;t include getting attacked. Furthermore we might be past that in certain manners to end of the line kinds of conversations with looks sideways for situated apparent but at what point is past reason for sanctity of self. The higher door was knocked for a reason with kindness and respect but also of great haste for in time of need. A matter of work and business would never be a good enough excuse for what needed to be done and could be done in effortless fashion across the board. <br><br>High heavenly beings and played to the normal man apparel at times walking past me like a life on a high end ridge after pilgrimage. There was some that need not forget that there are those that go on their own pace for I apologize for my haste. Saint regularity walked the streets and many did so with ethical chivalry that was subtle understood streamline. The common had visited days previous like some wiseman bestowment of refresh upon the spirit. His reason brought fourth in and of itself. He spoke sense and she was saved. The common sparkle in the eye sometimes undressed what it was as to the knowledge why other kinds operated the way they did but it was within how they operated as to where the answer partially lie and as wo why it was asked. Remembrance was one of the answers but so was advanced explanational that didn&#39;t have to go far into the intelligence of self to understand some of the simple in which would suffice for if need be absolution. Dark tidings of self in the past for whenever it was recognized and realized and whatever the hell else ized in what would need to be to safeguard the present in the past for the future. It would be a romantic story if need be but present inclinations had spoken of exhaust upon story of what it recognized to be contrasting with experience, memory and history. Double negative in energy at times creates a positive. They had screamed out, &quot;how do the good do it!&quot; and why would it be past reason to not do what need be done in the face of such tyranny. Such unfairness. How to be labelled the too far gone and resort to ways told to be frowned upon from eldest good. Debates of the century never seemed more relevant in this time of wood. How did Gandhi and Jesus describe how one was able to walk through life? It was for the average in which I asked this question. I couldn&#39;t imagine what it would to traverse heaven to recognize what it was for true. <br><br>I had seen that there wasn&#39;t too many actions to have to situate to be true. For even when looking at the physical, I had known that the grouping of actions that it would had made it seem the mishandle that something was run amuck amiss. Something was wrong in the hilarity of it all to be true for as funny as it might have been upo the two column comparison there was a dark excuse in the mix that of course made no sense given the wrong direction seen. For in front of it was a grouping that really didn&#39;t have shit to do with it other than the corrupted for what some thought it to be to survive. What did that make the average neutral and good citizen in the mix. Why were we not supposed to be in the mix? Somehow to have unawareness beyond what the average understood even in a casual and laimens term was a bluster until goggles without. <br><br>It was interesting that the greys spoke of humanoid and gender neutral. Both their form and demeanor told as such and yet both classically humans on this planet associated them with Alien and yet at the same time, when you think of perception in regards to humanoid, you subconsciously without a certain variable of awareness thought of grey alien forms because they spoke of humanoid. A building block to humanity was recognized in regards to the grey form. Moon lit skin and much more akin with Neutral Good that understood ethical morality. I found it fascinating the interplay of Humanoid and Alien in regards to the Greys especially in relation to earth-based human. One of the spiritual guardian parental type big to worship that monitored this planet in varying degrees. A metaphorical for the separating line at times that some thought to be more prominent yet totally transcended in this process for what was understood as to what it could be and what had already been seen. There was handlers in the spirit, true moral and neutral good in which reminded of a certain kinds of keepers. This storyline I had felt had a synergy in interpretational factors upon what I had seen as the relationship with the Greys and Humans. Even abduction cases for when seen in a read between the lines fashion spoke of medical in which the greys invoked. Healing was one of the answers and the psychic energies steeped upon abduction reports and experiencer explanational as well as cinema depiction of such in which spiritual have been known to tell truth through movie platform in the kinds of phenomenon, spirituality and gravity as well as media seen through such a platform spoke of higher healing. The story sight was there that they did protect us in certain manners only up to a point and although a neutrality is discerned I still like my meaning of interpretations. You can imagine early humans on this planet worshipping such gods of technology easily and it was interesting that we were moving to a point in time spiritually where we would be more inclined to worship them physically especially upon the realization that we always did anyhow given the spiritual history of this planet. There happened to be worships and energies associated on this planet not fully understood physically that spiritual if explained further would make sense even for some of the baseline worships to be make sense to be worshipped. Worshipping this earth was one of the primes but so was worshipping sol and space. Those three were regularity worship spiritual that existed on earth. It wasn&#39;t just nature of the moon but it might have best relayed what has been discerned from meaning regarding in healing. <br><br>There was a disconnect working and less of a disconnect that what some knew to be true. It had to do with understanding that many could claim that an encroachment upon the societal normality variable listings that are a part of accepted and facilitated societal from the organizations that my Main Spirit Guides relayed as per this writing. It can extend beyond incarnation and does in many manners. You should look towards older histories if need be if it extends to those time periods for the caseworks in which it does. In speaking to the spirit, do what you can, please. I remembered a working variable in degrees understood that painted the picture that most works needed in order to fully achieve strong possibility that the good have the power, means and ability as well as energy to save most if not all safely and instantly and to be able to do so easily was already created. Whatever variables it was that drove some to create styles of play in front of the scenes to stop the bleeding technically speaking might have been a part of the line of the conversation. <br><br>Near the end of the day there was more to what looked to be pinnacles but also threats and psychic attack. The real turning point had been a realization of certain kinds of styles of play being finished and for some of the ones that stayed better. Certain spiritual trying to get into my face and perception building in regards to this process to try and strongarm and muscle in. It was something to do with sports the day previous when I had watched NHL and NBA, where it was a good game there happened to be a spiritual maneuver on my end I disliked. This day near the end of the day it felt to be something similar except also different. The kinds of insinuations of attack and conflict is unmistakable at times but I have known there to be theatrics and bufferworks of a certain kind that exist and I didn&#39;t believe the good weren&#39;t around for true for how I felt, again maneuvering a feeling of one in the group to say that is how the groups feels sometimes doesn&#39;t meet the marker.<br></div>
