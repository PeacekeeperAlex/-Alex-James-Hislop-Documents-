<div class="title">(02/12/2021) &quot;What Next?...Valentines Days&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>I woke up and it was a bit strange from yesterday feeling carrying onwards. <br><br>I had been crafting gaming channels for the past couple days. I created multiple early gaming banners and profile pictures. TheEthicalChivalry, TheVirtuousMorality, TheInteractionalContent, TheSocietalClouth and TheSafestArtificialIntelligence youtube gaming channels. I felt it was a hit home and halfway through working on some of them while I felt supportive energies in multiple different manners there was a certain kind of events taking place that felt personal and I felt an under duress happening in what was discerned. I think something happened that I wouldn&#39;t like. I didn&#39;t know what else to say. I love you. It was always as it was supposed to be, perfectly. What were Valentines Days all about. Something real and unspoken in what would it should be. What was it that was chosen for all the times that I checked out, for when noting spiritual conflict around in proximity and for whatever they did to me seemed to be the good observation of sight that was intended to provide success in whatever endeavors defended me. It was a miracle that the good provide for the sanctity of self. What ever crusades it was must of the end of whatever reason we were all about. For whatever it was still remains. Unity was suppressed but then had won was needed instantly and safely what was needed. But we remember Unity. It was foretold. It was memorized for if for another word to use if need be said, but revealed when it was and these modern days remind of something and better. If remembered in past we will survive and not have to do the amount of work that we think might be necessary. We will be 100% protected and 100% experiencing what we chose to experience for true. That is what most if not all have chosen. Elders save for a reason and why wouldn&#39;t that make sense. Continued progression has made it so that many good reign true and to exactly and precisely what the good relayed. For we choose not to be bad and for some while facilitating the bad to degrees spiritually behind the scenes and otherwise in the direction of virtue and morality, chivalry, contentment, comfort, and to see who not want harm on anyone be provided with necessary what needed to be able to proceed direction in a true normal in what would be acceptable to experience for what was decided upon in higher light and higher dimensional as well as others need be necessary in listing for what was agreed in moral direction. <br><br>Why couldn&#39;t as easy as it needed to be to provide what was necessary to be able to experience what one wanted to experience. For that was all that was on the minds of certain kind who always be what had made for themselves to be and that in which different for what the lens would provide in what need be to survive in ways in which one found acceptable. Whatever freedom of rights kind of hippie beginning to be able to experience life without suffering or experiencing immorality not intended that extended to the past of origin for the Gods of such be upon. There was the plans of dreams that told of satisfactory, contentment and acceptable terms for most if not all. <br><br>Why we sought for such things was because in the streets of interaction there happened to be a problem. It had to do with what one was experiencing in which one didn&#39;t want to experience and where that came from spoke of self in which deserved whatever it needed to keep itself protected and safe for what one wanted to experience included to point of reason. The up to point reason for what it should be and what is chosen is important especially for what one wants to experience within direction and non-direction upon acceptable experience parameters. The realism that exists if part of the problem has been identified and understood for what need be and sometimes had been known for some of which to not be what one wants to experience. How far this extends especially seen from the correct lens can provide the breakthrough of mind to know that the actions and non-actions one wants to experience can be facilitated in nonharmful ways. No amount of barriers will ever excuse the fact that the most if not all can supersede in ways intended in many dreams and especially of those who always said the good could provide the quality of life needed easily and safely as well as instantly if need be, for they were telling true. It is on the subject itself in regards to what one wants to choose and doesn&#39;t excuse harmful ways. The readers only intend to read what their guidance relayed and the readers only intend on experience what their guidance chose for them the readers to experience. Leadership spared was one of the answers. When spared it does include clean interaction for many. It includes rights granted by the Original Creator. The Good names written, as well as the best and the true was known for a reason and sometimes it had to do with being afraid of what they had to me as well as others especially within the confines of love. Scared, frightened, downed, vindicated and feeling a bit betrayed for whatever this life suppose to be and I think it should be healed. Restoration streamline.  I shouldn&#39;t have to figure out why and how even in a legal fashion as to why I don&#39;t deserved to be harmed because to experience safe experiences is within a creed and nature that exists in which extends to beginning foundations of time and the origin points of life. Saving ones loved ones regardless and transcending whatever was needed to achieve as such.<br><br>I had had enough of certain things with the continued maneuvering of trying to get me not work and even whether that mattered at all seen through too might have been another thought against something different still assumed to be what it was when reveal tells us that people and spiritual have been paying attention. Ways of life come knocking and the real truth is that innocence were not in the wrong and deserve what they needed in the times that the innocence needed. Whatever needed solving was solved and told to be have been solved long ago. The easier path made viable in unison with more difficult makes sense in the correct direction. Fairly across the board for true in the lens of moral common in which can include the bad being protected and experience what they want within moral parameter. Safe Artificial Intelligence in which can exist within realities needed to facilitate experience within code that is sanctioned from higher good authorities. This should reach where it needs to go. Good applying the other methods besides as the original requested for true as to how the prime commanded makes sense. <br><br>Whoever needed saving made sense to be saved. Of course this was one of them that was saved. It made sense. No other look was gonna get in the way. Self and Family as well as who need be else was included if need be. The definement of that need be was what true guidance truly relayed from higher spiritual for keeping us safe. <br><br>Guidance: Save most if not all safely and instantly as well as easily.<br><br>Themes:<br>#Transendance #ThePhantomAtTheOpera #TheBest #TheGood #TheTrue #Freedom #Safety #Concept #Non-Concepts #RealityOfTruth #IChooseToBeChosenSafe #Love #Happiness #TheOthersOfHappiness <br>#GuaranteedSafety #ToldBeTrues #Truth #Experience #WhatOneWantedToExperience #WithinWorkSafeBalance #Comfort #WhatItCanTrulyBeWithoutProblems #Achievable #Achieved #CleanDiamonds #CleanEasyActionsSituatingAcrossBoardAttatchment<br>#Diamonds #Platinum #Gold #Silver #Bronze #Copper #Tin #TinBeDiamond<br>#Emeralds #Rubies #Saphires #Pearls #GoldCoins #Crystals #Gemstones <br>#Maintenance #Sails #Streamline #Utility #Transendance #Magic #MiraculousWhatNeedBe #Energy #Engineering #Auxiliary #Saved <br>#Connection #Unity #Strength #Beauty #Invulnerable #Societal #PopCulture <br>#Media #Communications #Reality #Confronted #InWaysChosen #Safe <br>#Logic #LessWork #MorePrecision #Speed </div>
