<div class="title">(01/11/2021) &quot;Spritiualists going to Church&quot;</div>
<div class="content">The sports game at times has felt a bit distant has felt distant in the kinds of energies discerned, at first upon taking up the activity I could feel a really great atmospheric even as far as as discerning some of the spirituality of the game for moments, days later the second time I watched it I could still discern that kind of spirituality and even with certain kinds of harrowing events and spiritual atmospherics from other activities like movie watching and supposedly in which I had seen synergy. The first game I had watched was a bit of stack of sporting energies and one of the tells was spiritual meeting points and a bit of culture clash. I was one of those that did feel upset at times because I felt my culture to truly be of that classic earth-based spiritualist. I wasn&#39;t the only one who felt that way but I was one of the few physicals in the mix that some would point towards and say that that wasn&#39;t my culture for obvious reasonings. The Second game felt to be a size up and review and in understanding some of the different spiritual culture in the kind of other dimensional at times that has been around some of us, I realized there was a facilitation of interaction that didn&#39;t always reflect the true for it really was but sometimes it did. Sports star energy facilitation like famous tradings and make dues in understanding how some operate. I didn&#39;t especially like the feeling of certain spiritual filtering through interaction at times for not wanting to disappoint, waste time or waste energy. I appreciated what some of them did but it was also on that point of owing favors or thinking that that was somewhat the trading point for something I didn&#39;t. You walk towards a mail box to pick up mail intending to pick up the mail and a person walks by handing you a bag full of cash and assuming you wont go pick up the mail and that it was a trade. He walks away without saying much and you are looking around like what the heel just happened. Now when you go pick up the Mail there shouldn&#39;t be a problem and that dude that ave you cash and walked away shouldn&#39;t show up with a baseball bat angry that you picked up the mail. *Maybe Come up with better explaining point on this one* When I do a clarification sometimes in regards to certain physicals, there is sometimes a spiritual in overlap life utilizing that gets angry. Understanding that in regards to  sports, that there are those of a certain kind that exists that are considered the rich, upper class and famous of some of these aspects and in a certain manner under the radar sometimes in how sports stars can operate. What exactly has some of the physical experienced especially from perspective of sports stardom for what some of them consider themselves to be? If it doesn&#39;t look like an off to side foul on the play then you see me and others relieved. The kind of good that the spiritual from Sports does is paramount, seen and understood. Outreach and Charity is what I should have been able to focus upon and should do so but there was other lenses as well. The alternative to battle spiritually has been seen even though many sports can be in reference to the kind of battle in sports that some physicals would reference in their live dimensional. I had discerned conflict at times spiritually on my end and had wondered what it was for the sports on this planet given history as well what it should be. There were those that asked that question as to what happens is you lose and a good answer was that one handled ones own punishment. I didn&#39;t know if that was always the case, I thought there were those were the coach handled such matters but I knew either way that the Physicals were some of those that would ask the question as why there would be punishment in regards to losing a game. The third game I had watched had a lot to do with morality for I discerned both teams to be emphasized in a certain manner in morality, maybe having more to do with the league itself and this physical earth-based human culture in the streamline understood natural of morality that existed but there was also team related emphasis that I had noted too. A play upon morality of stage but also story and symbolism. Surreal events seen within certain sporting events wasn&#39;t new for the kind of greatness that can be within the game. It only went so far though. Can you imagine any sporting within months period of time in regards to disasters like 9/11 where a portion of the literal game itself is lending towards saving. That was the kind of thing that took place at times with sports on this planet creating remedy for some of the disparity. It wasn&#39;t the only thing. <br><br>There was outlandish at times blamed upon me and so said about my culture when it had less to do with me. I was not only dealing with certain kinds of earth-based because some were trying to put the outlandish upon me in a misunderstanding but it was also other kinds too. The Fourth game had much to do about positivity in the kind of hopefulness and fun in pursuit of the game. I had reason to feel better. It reminded of earlier times. The fifth game yesterday might have been about greatness and innocence for some of the storyline seen on the court. On my end having to battle mentality to be true for a certain portion of the first half but also trying to enjoy the game through that kind of jargon.<br><br>I had noted that there was still arguing at times for the kind of direction that I as well as others wanted to go personally in heavenly existences of my own spirituality emerging not only from the Natural Original Setting State but also the good dimensional that some of us are truly from. As had been said before, if certain maneuverings were to happen spiritually there was that spiritual and dimensional as well as metaphysical that would not be impacted in a certain way. I had seen enough to make my choice in a certain manner. I already knew what many on this planet felt by way of the kind of spirituality they wanted around themselves. I had the literal answer for what their Guideships relayed. It was already seen and understood up to the points of acceptability. <br><br>Reading Enders game as well as playing video games invoked a Morality discernment as well as emphasis of movement in that loving and peaceful spirituality. A response that I have continued to see as even spiritualists in reference to the event in rising of vibrations and shifting machinisms lending towards morality had better quality of life spirituality enacted. There had been a classic in regards to the book itself in which really has had to do with quality of life for how it is referenced to infer good quality of life and a creation of such. <br><br>Data explaining dimensional science and non-dimensional science. Translatable for certain dimensional understanding within correct parameterworks that done relay false science.<br><br>It was a strange day given the kind of interactions that I had been having upon some software journey of repair and then even playing a bit of video games that seems in which some have been labelling something dangerous. <br><br>Themes:<br>#Unyielding #Eternal #ThatGoodSpirituality #HeavenlyEmergence #HeavenlyEmphasis #InteractionalBliss #Integrity #Will #Tenacity #Strong #Motivation #Inspiration #Structure #Stability #Reason #Purpose #Meaning #Stardom #Planets #Famous #Earth #Spiritualism #Nature #Anima #Good #Hope #Faith #Dreams #Digital #Earth #Internet #Software #Windows #Repair </div>
