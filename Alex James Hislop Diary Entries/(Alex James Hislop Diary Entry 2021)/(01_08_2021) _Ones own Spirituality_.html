<div class="title">(01/08/2021) &quot;Ones own Spirituality&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>After the depression of yesterday even through Good discernment of showing up for true the nowhere nears enough for what it used to be for some shines an ever question point in the direction of the lines of conversations and situations. I realized there was supposedly smaller matters that spoke of itself in a certain manner but the answer seemed to be upon an earlier point brought up in this process having to do with quality of life and what that has predominately and historically pertained towards in the rights granted to most if not all by the Original Creator. Those rights have already been attained and viewing at as such and that some are at times spiritually trying to encroach those rights as seen evident by physical crime emergence as well as diseases on this planet along with other supposed natural seems to relay that encroachment up to a point. Love and Peace. Those two creeds might be chosen most on earth in a certain manner and regardless they are practiced both in synergy of physical and spiritual. Live dimensional and spiritual. Soothsayers were more of a prominent figure in earth history of spirituality and it might have had less to do with the name but rather what a soothsayer actually does. They spoke how many on this planet wanted to speak. Future discernment in crystal was thought to be a part of such a way of life but just as reality relays truth and fact for in those two variables that sense and discernment can only go so far. That was a part of fortune telling too. It was obvious not to see something in which could damage and it wasn&#39;t always about violence. It was an interesting interplay upon the rich and the poor as well as the middle class. I had discerned the soothsayer to be a part of intellectual culture. <br><br>There was this interesting observation about how the rich succeeded in doing their job of smarts and being smart. Intellect chosen at times naturally but also unnaturally in such a group. I found it poetic that the compassion needed at times by the middle suppressed partially by way of suppression in making it easier to be compassionate. Money, Monetaries and Financial. How the average on this planet at times struggled with compassion not to degrees unfit for societal fit to not be unfit. The kirk and spock synergy wasn&#39;t the only player but it was a well known classic archetype interplay. From a perception stand point there could be debate movies about the compassion physically on this planet by the average joe. I know that the morality involved is a hardline natural that speaks of normality that exists within heavens resident. I knew the cold and walk on by attitude existed too. That coloured my perception at times. It was a difficult that existed for if it was found that somehow that compassion was not what some had hoped it to be in such a classification as the average on this planet, apologies of self exist, but I found it unfair for the thought that somehow the middle and poor didn&#39;t fulfill their part upon the rich making their end of the bargain in the compassion-intellect movement for how difficult it is to be compassionate when one struggles without a quality of life. There was a spiritual tell as well for it wasn&#39;t just about cash and credit. There was metaphorical of physical class systems on earth in many different manners both spiritually as well as physically. <br><br>But within earth human culture I had discerned the soothsayer to be able to transcend those lines a part of peoples from many different walks of life in celebration of life. It was the brilliance of spirituality earth based that did extend beyond physical humanity. It wasn&#39;t just the soothsayer to be able to move past a misunderstanding of attachment and interpretation of spiritual wealth to literal monetary value and the similar. There were still those issues though. Lightworkers dissolved those issues. They are another a part of earth spirituality that in perception reminded of earlier times of positivity. It was an interesting facade that spoke of truth. Lightworkers existed in the spirit too and my perception on that one told of Guardians to be true. Some didn&#39;t realize at times the importance of such lightworking being done throughout their lives. Placement of light energies upon the the body in overlap happened to be placement of light energies upon family in what ones guideships relayed for how the spirit can maneuver dimensional and spiritual. There was that knowledge I so desperately wanted some on this planet to know having to do with the ability to look towards the light and that some as well as many were already looking towards the light as they lived their lives. <br><br>*Talk about Science and how physical Scientists point towards experiencers spiritually. The perception that Science and Spirituality are more separate is more of a false perception that some realize in which does hold truth in what is sensed at times physically on this planet but is more of a falsehood when you point towards the spiritual. There is an overlap in regards to Science and Spirituality and it was interesting that the spiritualist was pointing towards science in a forerunning capacity that would hopefully become more accepted within physical science. That what experiencers are relaying does hold salt within science in which is understood in many case studies. The Scientists on this planet like to have physical evidence and evidence more than just experiencers but when it comes to spirituality it would be interesting that to transcend that in a certain manner would be to move past certain barriers. We had already seen this maneuver past in regards to miracles. Funny enough that it would be seen prominently as well within medical profession through miraculous healings that happened throughout. I found it amazing the kind of patient history prowess spiritually extended to doctors and the history of medicine that would prove those healings to be true. <br><br>From a safe distance, the events happening these days spiritually sounds to be on the money. The real history of what we are from relays that just because you don&#39;t have any money, doesn&#39;t mean you are not what you want to be. Security of self speaks of that regardless of of whether you feel secure or not. We are from hope but it might not have been called that back then. How it works in the light and other spiritual that my Main Spirit Guides listed is that ones doesn&#39;t need to worry about crime or impoverty as well as other social issues seen. It is the truth but what hasn&#39;t been relayed at times is that there is still problems that exist in certain places. Nations, Banners and Factions exist and there is dimensional that wont ever have to worry even if the Original Creator saved most if not all. There was also the tell that even though there is potential spiritual manipulation regarding physical crimes on this planet, that it might not actually be as it seems given certain framework and compromise. As most physicals on this planet are from the light as well as other good dimensional and spiritual as well as the other kinds that my Main Spirit Guides indicated if need be, I had recognized in my kitchen an easy point relayance that had to do with the ease in which that spiritual we are from can provide that baseline quality of life which does include being saved. It speaks of religion. Of Family. Of Gaming. The transcendence past exists today and it does have to do with the fact of good spirituality existent within the common man. Within many if not all. It does have to do with realization that the good spiritualist got it correct in the kind of spirituality focus point that relays remembrance that it is not just from that spirituality we are from but also what that sentiment relays in overlap immediate live present upon ourselves everalways. Why ones own spirituality for what ones considered ones own spirituality as well as what one chose is so important. No amount of wish wash was going to change that variable.<br><br>Themes:<br>#Spirituality #Love #Compassion #Intellect #OnesOwnSpiritual #Atmoshperics #Safety #Smoothen #Understanding #WhatHaveIChosen #Lightworking #Empathics #Witches #Soothsaying #Wicca #Transformation #Meditation #Yoga #Reason #Medical #Healers #Runes #Realism #Magic #Imagination #Wonder #Contemplation #FastFood #NewAge #Gods #Titans #Magnifiathans #Good #Moral #Chivalry #Safety #Insinuation #Inspiration #Intuition #Guidance #BaseLineQualityOfLifeIsQualityOfLife #Media #UnitedNations</div>
