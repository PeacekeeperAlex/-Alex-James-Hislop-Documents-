<div class="content">Dreams: Old Friends, Reunited, Remembrance of Past, Sunset Boulevard, Shiny and digital, technology and new, raptors and sports, overweight can play basketball, dream alignment to new relayance of speaker, deadwood, love, moments of shame and uncomfortable, houses discerned to have points of need be intervention, former best friends enders game movements, discernment and clarification, Jesse and Dillon, calling upon others families and my family, need help, catching up,  President Administration eras, Trump and Biden.<br><br>Updates and dreamscapes. Infrastructure merry go round, dream experiencer stoppages and then carrying on where dream left off. Utilization.  I discerned good in regards to those infrastructures but I did feel an encroachment in regards to my interaction that might have been for good. Maybe some were letting their presence be known. I noted a certain kind of bufferworks spiritual. I felt there was a neglect in regards to some of those infrastructures and that certain spiritual dreamers had had enough of certain bullshit. I didn&#39;t know if there was POWs being saved from some of those infrastructures but there are many that know themselves to be good and POWs don&#39;t just pertain to military and soldiers.<br><br>There was a cleanup and forming up happening in what I discerned, news of some of what I have witnessed in some of my experiences and it made me wonder what the revelation network was relaying especially in regards to some of the news and events as well as tone of not only conversation but action and non-action. Like what exactly was new in the way that some were relaying for what was understood and was it more of certain kind catching up? I didn&#39;t savor the prospect of if it was certain darker kind, a safe bufferworks spiritual referencing in how I usually reference darker kind anyhow getting a certain leeway to form up and attack especially upon some of the insinuations of what was happening. What else though has been let known in understanding situations and at what point is it already understood. There was News and Media and some of it pointed towards defense and safety in the winnings that the good were achieving. But there was also interesting and intrigue not only in the regarding but also of the news itself. Maybe the question what was the news and when compared to a parameterworks that my Main Spirit Guides listed where did that leave ending comments. What did direction reflect? It was interesting that it was partially being able to live life and enjoy creation and construction as well as other beloved topics and themes as to why it was so important in regards to understanding where we were and what was to be understood.<br>Also, what the heck was some of the news of positivity and enlightenment. Pop culture, art and science. That was also a supposed subdue at times within this process that I discern for some to have been a ruse, while others truly felt there to be a missing link needed regarding.  *Clean this up a bit.<br><br>I hated having to say that English emerged on this planet in a certain sense of inflection indicating that it might have emerged in the spirit first if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that it emerged by the true good first. You can look at most things and know that if it did happen to emerge first in the spirit that it was the true good in which facilitated as such. <br><br>I noted the ability to change form in the spirit on a level that reminded of being able to change clothes, the shaping variables seen at times for some on this planet physically but also elsewhere probably too reminded of that in a certain sense with the comparison to the spiritual that utilized similar forms but understood to be their own spirit. This was understood in many different ways, Spiritual Energy Signatures (SES), was one of the ways that that was understood. A person shaped in the likeness of someone was still their own person in the ways that their Guideships indicated. People are their own People the way their Guideships indicated. I had noted people and spiritual shaped in the likeness of specific spiritual and people in which shouldn&#39;t dictate their life to degrees that their guideship indicated and I had noted at times that it was something that was taking place at times. There was also ways to employ shaping where it be a smaller variable of shaping in certain manners as to not be intrusive in aesthetic manner. <br><br>I had noted that a continued mentality manipulation and antagonism in regards to certain infrastructure upon certain people was evident. I had noted it upon myself in many different manners in the kind of influencing that exist from spirit and I did note some of that changing for the good. My wordings only ever pertain to what my Main Spiritual Guideships chose for them to pertain and some of it has had to do with safety in certain kind of spiritual taking my words out of context. It was one of those ones that I didn&#39;t want to have to fear. I wanted my words to relay truth and I do want to focus on positive and enlightened but sometimes there is certain things that are relayed in what I note in my experiences that I write down. Banner interplay was noted in regards to some of the ill utilization in regards to in front of the scenes beings at times but also that there was a good and bad line defined. Another line had been swindlers of a certain kind saying to go certain directions and then for certain directions of what said swindlers claimed to be of showing up and rectifying. It felt like there was a mock up of a certain system put around me in which looked to be there for antagonizing in which was said to be dealing with antagonization issues but really seemed to be a blatant. <br><br>Like those talking to higher lines for certain kind of higher to intervene and it being mistaken with others that are located lower is a big clarifications already fairly understood for realism to exist in front of the scenes if Higher directions do not reflect what we fully need them to, mainly for the True Good and Good as well as the Original Creator to save most if not all safely and instantly. <br><br></div>
