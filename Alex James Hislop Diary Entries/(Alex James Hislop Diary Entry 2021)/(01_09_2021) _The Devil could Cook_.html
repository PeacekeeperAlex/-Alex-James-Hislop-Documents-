<div class="title">(01/09/2021) &quot;The Devil could Cook&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br><br>I had struggled at the beginning of this year in deciding as to whether I had wanted to continue letting know of some of the experiences that were taking place around me. On one hand I wanted to write down certain moments for rememberall but I also had looked at living life without having to write down what was taking place at times. There were those spiritual that didn&#39;t want me to write down in which so said to see if it had anything to do with it or not but I think some of that was conjecture which really spoke of some of the debate that had happened at times. How much life mattered was important but it was the same point as to why some had said that we should put our heads down and live our lives. There was a problem with that last point and the former. There had been this notion that some at times had been unable to live their lives to acceptable degrees because of unacceptabilities. The other had been a point that said if you speak out against those unacceptabilities might be the reason for the existence of such. Which of those two though does it seem to speak of the higher problem ultimately. The former was a clear answer. To speak upon turbulent matters and write about experiences to me as well as others didn&#39;t seem to be the problem. It was an obvious clarity. <br><br>Me noting that I had felt my inner conscious be maneuvered in a certain manner when I was in the shower is one of those things I wanted to write down because it did matter. I had written at times here to let know because I was scared. Considering the many outlets and opportunities as well as alternatives I had wondered about different avenues but these are my diary entries after all. No spiritual was going to be able to change that true considerment. Physically I didn&#39;t want spiritual to have to deal with certain life utilizers in regards to this life. <br><br>Certain Spiritual not giving up the ghost upon certain infrastructure, like a knowledge that I have obtained and what it seems to be on my end with awareness hat it is more than that up to a point with certain spiritual upon that infrastructure at times has created styles of play to a certain degree. Styles of interaction might be the better observation. I had felt this morning like there a lot of light and good other dimensional with a struggle from some to hold power in which to what was resorted towards made no sense especially if they considered themselves good.  <br><br>It was clear to see that me living my life was to include certain maneuvering that the good could handle completely for if they couldn&#39;t then there really was more of a problem than need to be. I was a psychic-medium, that was understood. I spoke with my out loud voice to certain spiritual and talked about rights issues. The encroachment upon attainment of rights granted under the moral constitutions and constitutions of good authorities already gave me leeway to talk about such rights issues in a certain inflection and connotation but what some needed to understand was that physically and spiritually I could still talk about such things anyhow regardless given those rights granted. This was a part of what the comedy and debate were pointing towards in that I didn&#39;t need to explain that within my Diary Entry. On one hand you had a group of spiritual that understood what was happening and others that were still trying to forget, with another group of spiritual truly under duress. It was clarified past point of acceptability for some. The true battle though really had to do with something being suppressed and having to do with faith. Certain good banners that didn&#39;t want to deal with certain truth and fact were hiding themselves similarly to other that were within certain infrastructures. Red tape politics existed in the spirit. It was the dumbassery continuance. For the simple answer of God spark amalgamation and prison would suffice with movement of life and reanimation of bodies that would save the infrastructure that some held higher than family. That there was a powerful few that worked together anyhow on more sticking point situations that could get it done in an instant safely without any collateral. How could one be choosing family over this shit when it was this shit that was claimed to be that was causing distress upon family. Who would choose politics over family. Who would forget to include politics as family. Who would forget politics of family.  I had wondered what the new wonders were considered, the higher light pale shadow of former selves or voldemorts statue in harry potter. The snake wasn&#39;t the bad guy but he sure as shit looked like one at times. When the lack of considerment in regards to what one finds acceptable is compares some had to fall back into statues. The kind of power that good had could make them into statues. The too many cooks in the kitchen gameplay in mind. There was some with red aprons not all of the same colour. Context was remembered. Sometimes I wrote to the spirit where the Guideship of the reader had to fill in the blanks. I would ask is this life worth this? For what I have written doesn&#39;t deserve ill manners.<br><br>I also did advocationals. In what world of tell or not would that be a problem given the spiritual informations and energies that my Main Spirit Guides indicated.<br><br>I created content. Emphasized informational placement safety and energy placement safety. There those physicals on my planet that played it silently the way their Guideships indicated. <br><br>There was events put fourth on me by way of charleton utilizers. That was more truth than not for if it wasn&#39;t than what did that mean about how others operated. Considering the truth information regarding physical and self it gave the physical a lot of power. Considering the stringent safeguards regarding what one experiences and how important what one experienced was as well as what dimensional many of us are from, it let know in ways more than what was expected. The good could situate this interaction hands down easy and didn&#39;t deserve to be poached regarding in a certain manner legally. <br><br>Later on in the day there was energy beams from head shooting upwards. I felt a smooth energy but good energy as well as tell that good spirituality involved in regards to certain maneuvering. Events taking place and potential normal spiritual actions in certain dimensional areas. Somehow the lightworking makes sense and being understood to be normal in many different areas made me think that the kind of energy actions and even non-actions that I have seen for the good and moral as well as defensive in correct direction are more normal than what some make them out to be. <br><br>Friggen heck though upon hearing that spiritual through me also promoting actions as well as me and the sync that some tried to do to pass off the blame upon me in which the look on others through me might something similar. There is also a look of battler in the light as well as other dimensional in which certain kind tried to put fourth blame to alleviate away from certain kind within those battles. The lost morality of what one experiences that is being muted. The Silence deafens. Wouldn&#39;t it be the use of the fact that some of what was claimed to be not experiencing by way of desensitization to not feel any of it or even portions of it was actually being experienced in certain manners, not the ways that science would relay in how technically speaking but in the tangible some would point towards upon foul, that would cause some to care less about that in which was still important in how science relays. <br><br><br>Themes:<br>#Sports #Strong #Abnormal #Remedy #Remembrance #Memory #GhostsOfFacade #Comedy #Warfare #Evident #Infrastructure #Other-DimensionalSelves #Beams #Chakra #Points #History #Media #Discussions #Truth #Exists #Energy #Creation #Power #Information #Faith #Light #Spiritual #Correct #Dark #Morality  </div>
