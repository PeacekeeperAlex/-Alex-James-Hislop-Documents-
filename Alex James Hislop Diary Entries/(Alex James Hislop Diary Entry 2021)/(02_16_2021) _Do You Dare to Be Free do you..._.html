<div class="title">(02/16/2021) &quot;Do You Dare to Be Free do you...&quot;</div>
<div class="content">“…There is the heat of Love, the pulsing rush of Longing, the lover’s whisper, irresistible—magic to make the sanest man go mad.”<br>― Homer, The Iliad<br><br>“Any moment might be our last. Everything is more beautiful because we&#39;re doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now. We will never be here again.”<br>― Homer, The Iliad<br><br>Activity:<br>Why wouldn&#39;t i want what i need to be able to fully defend myself properly for whatever had to deal with for elders and more in this life for what we chose to be and who we want to be especially when dealing with maintenance lines of foreverlasting if need be and I would be all the much pleaser for this to be understood for what needed understanding especially in recognition in which way this needs to go especially for inner self for what chosen and earlier time frame past selves honoring in what could i say to them in understanding direction. Why wouldn&#39;t I want my own saved as well as the others that needed to saving be instantly and easily saved for what it will be. It can be done safely and securely in manners with did speak of true meaning and good intentions with reasoning enough to be sanctioned justifiable for the kinds of crimes admitted to have happened to whoever it was that was most of all innocent but also uninvolved with any of what labelled what my Main Spirit Guides referenced especially in understanding what exactly present day looks to be upon. Whatever it turned into was spoken in what need be let knows on such a day of reckoning and reclaiming whatever it made one to be whole again and happy once more for true. I choose to be saved in my meaning, my action, my interaction to reflect something better and continue to proceed in the ways I have continued and what my actions reflect at times is not having need be powerful or famous but rather something different and better as well as allsafe with whatever old magic it was to shut it down if need be for if self defense and defense of ones own interferes with whatever it is and not by my intentional to be true and at what point does it need to be something different and look and feel and know it to be better in the ways that higher guidance relayed. Dreams forever in directional of play and safety as well as love in a celebration of what one is for real and what one proceeded with and how did one operate in what one chose. <br><br>Love and Peace. Wish nothing but the best all clear.<br><br>Hope and Meaning. Drive to sunset and be healed. <br><br>What One chose to Experience and Map Healing.<br>Instant healing across the map to all those who requested truly in what one would choose under fair circumstance and due process especially in what one understood regarding ones own direction. Science, History and Language could be taught fairly streamlined still. When one had decided that carry out as to what it was to succeed and bring decision coherency as well as automated ways to proceed in ways of operating and anatomical design of what one chose without any conflict or ripple affect problematics completely free of any problem. When you see that manifest upon the board healing the entire map and spiritual energies saving in a different way, maybe it was reason that told of why it was a good thing. What did the science explain? They told definitional as to how one ticks but also how one operates, explaining the machina and omni 100% safe and in directions of true good moral ways to proceed. <br><br>The True Good do have the power to be able to save most if not all. Safely, Instantly, Easily with Ability, Power, Means, Force, Logistics, Action, Movement, Streamline, Authority, Authorization and near all of the other ways as well as too. The Original Creator near too has the ability to do so as well and in prowess comparison safe the True Good and The Original Creator have strong power level comparisons in direction of morality and even neutrality. Legally speaking much of it is in line. The relationship between neutrality and the original creator is fascinating for many reasons but one of which happens to do with chemistry in the relations of TOC and Neutrality. The kinds of safety on the board has been noted. Whatever was needed fulfilled. Board covered with what was requested and that brought healing. The kinds of healing one requested has been happily met with what one chose and is glad things are getting better. <br><br>There is different variations of the above that have power levels in the same ballpark estimate range. Most of which are good in the sense of labellment my guidance relayed and when in comparison to that famous line of alltold of how most if not all feel to be true regarding what should happen of save and what one experience only be within the parameterworks that my Main Spirit Guides communicated regarding this writing. The info was there and explanationals told true as to whatever it was, should and could in the kind of directional in could traverse leading to experience of what one wanted and told of to be true. At what one desired was at command at times in which could be totally in line for most at any given moment. Time was an interesting variable at times for how it could be in any given moment of not abiding for whatever amount of encroachment upon life that happened...and then when if it ever was in the face of whatever might be trying to deal with such terror with the presence be known I understood myself to be frightened and disillusioned at same times as winning and hitting home. Quiet sensibility of moving forward and finishing whatever nonsense it was that somehow thought that experiences perpetuated against innocents were ever going to be situated. The Experience facilitation regarding immorality emulation infused with heavy morality should be utilized with meticulous manner. There is a correspondence of lines where one should sense regarding. We felt we happened to be able to be facilitated in directions of experiences chosen by our guideships and to be able to experience large amounts of morality masked as violent video games acceptable within society. This Physical Earth I felt did like moral infusement upon the physical human video games and spiritual video games chosen from higher moral direction. There were many that agreed in regards to safe immorality emulation and in fact was one of the ways to provide ways of life facilitation, one of keys and answers as well as primes especially in regards to prison facilitation. All kinds of different inflections, platforms, organizations, expressions, thinks of movies to video games and how just ones aspect could be made into the red carpet, with reality structures utilized in similar manners to degrees of what one wants to see and sense. Think of horror genre for some in the kinds of ways to be able to explore freedom all safe. Some had been looking for the vampiric kind of style modern fun all the clippings in which facilitation exists. Self exists too for what one can handle and there is only so far for some and I had wondered what this modern day approach would have to be and what I chose it to be in comparison and how long it was going to take until it was finally understood as to the lines were in the past and if they would come to the side of facilitation of certain ways that might difficult to describe without stepping over the line. IT was also ways of life and the facilitation of structures that was one of the answers. Most of it can be facilitated and transferred as well as even from home with streamline home dimensional upon. Most if not all. Remember. Whoever else it was besides the old man and true good that could save most if not all safely and instantly could do so and potentially quite easily. I would invoke what need be for later on if that what was supposedly said but maybe it was something more simple and I don&#39;t feel I have done the wrong that they said to deserved what was said for the kind of psychic attack and stimuli discerned with insinuation and there is true life lived in what we think this is all about.  <br><br>I felt different these days and what I wanted to say is that I am still who I was in the past and that I am sorry, I am sorry to self and the rest whatever saved guardian it was for me to do that I hope and manifest the best and favorites as well as who I needed to pull from to be what was dutied for this life and what kind of next it really was and how if people no saved no end. I needed peace in my life. I wanted. I wrote a bit about it, I talked a bit about it and what I needed was the good approach of just chill and be silent.
