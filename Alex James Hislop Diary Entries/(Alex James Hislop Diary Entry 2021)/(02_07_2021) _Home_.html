<div class="title">(02/07/2021) &quot;Home&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity: <br>This past six days I had been calling home for a reason. It seemed that the past and present as well as future was at my doorstep. I realized that what they were saying mattered. That anything I did in life might be the difference. Interaction had everything to do with it. Setting interaction and non-interaction spiritually was one of the keys for especially the importance of live interaction too. There had been battles spiritually in the past especially this past five days in regards to interaction situating. How some might see it on a map has had to do with good maneuvering through, about and for some stationary in what will be. Wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if there was a correlation to the past as to why current interactions be situating. There should be a force maneuvering in streamline for those parts of time and history in which are reflecting an interactional hit. Doors closed was another answer and key tell in which figured for whatever that be cause as well. This was one the key lines to pay attention towards. Not a single scratch and the too many cooks in the kitchen relayed as such for many if needed be. Of course the look over to the side in the past to when it was only one single cook for true might have held the answer. I called upon home because I wanted to go home and I wanted to feel better. I was scared and tired for what I was witnessing at times. There was a bravery line and confronting line regarding myself especially for the kind of bad that had happened to me in present time. I was frightened to look over at some of the other lines at times for the other physicals were totally innocent and had done nothing wrong. Many spiritual were innocent as well. There were those that needed healing. Another line of need be mend. That answer of everybody saved easily and all safe while being done as instantly as to what could be achieved was initiated.  <br><br>The super bowl colour theme silver rainbow affect and the interplay of what this earth-based physical culture is from and they had the spirituality from earth-based colourful tapestry in the mix in a banner and national sort of way. There was this interesting observation that had to do with certain colour of spirituality Earth-Based being infused and emphasized within national military in which also emphasized elite and pro. A natural tough understood without having to resort to tough guy antics. I felt I saw a glimpse of this especially given societal clouth and societal emphasis in one of the special NFL logos. It gave me hope. I felt it was spoken with a mad scientist half time show performance and the earth style societal emphasis but truly of earth made sense. Whether it be the light facilitating as such.  <br><br>I was scared again for the insinuation of certain things in regards to everyday. Having to worry saving someone when an event took place. I was small in understanding at least from perception live dimensional understanding in a certain manner regarding the gravity of how large life really can be. I knew there was older beings that existed in which life lived made me nervous and overwhelmed for what life can truly in the want to understand capacity for it could be especially not in directions that desensitize or lie to self. It&#39;s why even just common severity in regards to understanding one of the most important things in regards to life having to do with experience and how important experience really was specifically in not experiencing that in which one didn&#39;t want to experience. I felt the good saved. I felt they did in spectacular fashion but also sublime acceptable manners. I knew that hope was everything in certain areas but compared to screams from those that need be ok and of self warranted a correct analyzation of importance not from the perspective of what cause more or less damage but of compassion, humility and what was correct ethically. The for when it comes knocking at your door and in ways unacceptable points towards the compassion and care as well as sanctity of self revival. <br><br>The cops showed up after prompting a truth in a verbal spar with higher spiritual in what seemed to be. The kind and caring as well as compassionate for what I know myself to be was worried for how some had started utilizing care and compassion especially in ignoring certain conflicts and told of parameters reasoning for why it is ignored or approached in a certain manner. It made me feel upset for how some who were trying to situate certain situations were labelled. Interaction was another solver. <br><br>What was happening as to why some were upset in regards to how i chose to proceed in regards to my life in the present. There was this anti-camp decent approach, the tortuga idea and how far back in the past did some spirit go with such a proceeding. There was events that took place in the past that beforehand was a good control variable, like with most events. A certain kind changed how they proceed regarding. There was this cool crowd called in the beginning and it was grouped with in front of the scenes replaying of history in which spoke of and was infused together with the beginning in a certain fashion reflecting strength for that beginning. Where spiritual traversed in certain directions that might have seemed new school and that for some of that beginning was known to have already been understood. Events and history might have been impacted by way of the past especially upon reflection and knowing of past but also with interaction of past immediate. With the kinds of events and experiences discerned on my end I had an approach that respected a certain variable having to do with the fact that the good and the original creator had the power and the means to facilitate without anyone getting harmed, etc.(defined by my Main Spirit Guides) immoral ways of life, near as good if not better than the real thing. I believed in bad out of politics. I believe that the true good should be able to provide better than the corrupt. I knew that the good had the power to win outright safely and instantly as well as easily for however far that went. I knew home was a topic of discussion. I realized home for the home of old could facilitate interaction across the board to acceptable degrees for true safely and instantly as well as easily and especially including recourse and ripple affect situated to acceptable degrees. The easily that it could be done was reliant on the powerful mathematics and technology as well as magic that existed to achieve as such. Ways like quick switch outs of drivers and allpersonal upon incarnation and if a terminology exists, outcarnation before any duress takes place. A theatric facilitation too for portions of when it needed to take place. The kinds of facilitation prowess that the good hold, especially upon present time but also in the past was never outmatched for true. It had to do with family. It had to do with some changing their ways. It had to do with Family and Creator stopping what needed to be stopped. I was angry with some of them. Angry that the Original Creator never facilitated the parameter works fully needed in the past to not have to deal with some higher up bully uncle who wasn&#39;t even the bad given what would happen. That in which was in front of the scenes in which was supposedly considered a certain form of bad to be able to reference safely as the problem, I didn&#39;t know if there was a connection. I knew the Original Creator used to save most if not all safely and instantly. That at one point immorality encroachment and facilitation of safe ways emulating immorality was not a problem. Present time winnings for what I would see would be far enough within the informational needed listing for true tells me that in present time that has been achieved. That was always the line. I knew miracles existed across the board fairly easily.<br><br>Mine was a case of self defense and defense of my own as well as what my Main Spirit Guides relayed. Earth was innocent. The other physicals for what I understood for most of them at least as far as the milky way galaxy were mostly innocent with a small criminal element having to deal with unfairness of live dimensional but also manipulation in the spirit.  <br><br>There was a tell that there was battle reaching into home at times for what home considered itself to be. They said why is home within smokes. A tell of soldiery is what some said and remembrance. There was a personal circus that some wanted to point out for when certain personal kind with aesthetics as such intervenes there there was both those saving by way of providing alternatives and manpower in stopping certain personal but that there was also those posing to be good as well as in which spoke of different direction.
