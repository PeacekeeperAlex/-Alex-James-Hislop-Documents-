<div class="title">(01/26/2021)</div>
<div class="content">Dreams: An old style Greek map, three generals, one mentioned that he could walk instead of sail with connotation that it was much quicker to sail but that the land moved with him when he walked. The answer was no and it was seemed like it was done through me but more of a father figure channeling through. After I had awoken I had looked towards something in which I felt my eyes go black in part of what I was hooked too and then I envisioned that my eyes went bright freemen blue and then intense white in which I felt to have worked in healing, I had envisioned healing in my head as well in which that seemed to have worked less. <br><br>I had a pondering as to what would help greek gods of past and I felt that one of the answer would be home, more home of old good spiritual around them in which they no doubt noted that that kind of spirituality was already around them but sometimes when one couldn&#39;t feel like it was around that it felt like it wasn&#39;t around. Why would it be a use of old history in culture that reminds of home and earlier ages in which that culture exists today. Large amount of morality involved. I didn&#39;t know what the context of the dream or what the past impressional brought fourth around me had been about but I was worried. There was discussions about what was happening in the past in regards to my life as well as certain events unfolding to be true. I had noted there was this kind of look for when past was present in regards to future interaction regarding in which there was both a look of reliance for some but another one that seemed to not give the salt needed as well as not be being able to said salt. There was at times spiritual letting know of future, and dimensional overlap relaying future both done safely at times for what needed to be seen and yet there was this perception that spoke of a lack of sight and credence both in regards to the future. Reliance on future forecasting is one of those things in which you start to understand the minute attention in why it matters in how to proceed and ways of operating. I knew God Culture knew more than what they let on, there was a dream spoken from realism to magic and societal to heroes that let know that they understood and cared but could only go so far that spoke of something similar to that fact that God Culture understood and cared. I wanted that perception of obliviousness thought to be in regards to certain God Culture in regards to events taking place to be clarified. It was told that it was more clarified than what some wanted to accept. That it has been clarified for long time now. A part of that clarification was understanding that there was whimsical that existed a part of certain God Culture in which in understanding wasn&#39;t going to go away upon understanding the truth as is evident by way of many Gods understanding while whimsical and magic safeguarded.  <br><br>There has been a large amount of defense work as well as healing work and safeguarding through morality as well as other kinds intended by the Guardians and Higher Selves of readers in regards to content experiencers on this plane but also content creators. I would envision future where moral forces made it through to where they needed to go for safeguarding of this content. It was another revelation as to certain things I could work on but also recognization that I am already working on that kind of stuff and have worked on that endeavour in the spirit. I knew there was works that happened and had taken place as well as certain kind that had gone certain directions viewed as saviors of a retrofitting kind proven a certain variable of unruly justified feeling. Can you imagine working on something for billions of years and a variable changing literally having to go the path of starting a certain kind of again. You can see why certain kind wouldn&#39;t want certain resources falling in the hands of those that tried to derail certain work for said resources. Circumstances and put fourth of crumb should be understood for those derailments might have been done by certain kind not wanting too and truly didn&#39;t want too upon remembering who they are, but I did recognize that certain kinds of workers had a severity of look upon them looking outwards for the Gods of work existed. I didn&#39;t know how some of those Gods viewed certain kind being forced to work but I had wondered what the cases of those brethren that my Main Spirit Guides relayed had been viewed by such Gods. What did the Earth-Based Branch indicate in regards to this planet physically for what the physicals on this planet were experiencing spiritually? I knew why some cared so much about their work for it was in the name of endeavour itself. It could be considered personal and I had wondered if it often times was. I knew that higher dimensional had already done the work needed for safety and defense as well as quality of life. I knew it existed in a stockpile of what shouldn&#39;t have been seen as over abundance. It was realistic and would be considered as such if it would be employed. <br><br>Yesterday, I felt to have been moved prominently as I went to sleep. I didn&#39;t know what the heel this one was all about, I had surmised a good thing in the mix for the kind of not wanting it to be bad but also in discernment of aesthetic. What exactly was it going to take to just understand the simplicity in the simplistic version of how I wanted to interaction to be set. The answer is that it was already understood by the spiritual that I wanted to set my process, at least for a large portion. Those that didn&#39;t know by now made me curious as to what some were playing at. Even with knowing styles of play exist. How many more styles play were going to be invoked given the kinds of experiences and insinuations in this process already. <br><br>Days previous there had been a moment where someone had chimed that I would want to vindicate myself in a certain manner, I had prompted that a certain kind of group and groups of spiritual be vindicated in a certain sense because I felt that they were not vindicated to acceptable degrees within perception. Some of it had to do with process related, earth-based related as well as friend and family related in which there was overlap regarding all three. It felt like yesterday something had been pulled where it looked like multiple groups being given informational at the same time upon certain revelation, like a brought into the fold at the same time in which looked to be good at the same times as insinuations of bad being trapped upon my process that I had seen through and wondered if certain were trying to vindicate through a maneuver that reminded of the beginning of what was explained at the beginning of this paragraph. Maybe I was suppose to be vindicating myself but I felt that I had already been vindicated. Why were there these continued bringing fourth and into folds as well.<br><br>Today I had worked on the United Nations Board on Peacekeeperalex Trello Account. It was good to see that I did do something given my ability of awareness as well as my learning in regards to advocational and testificational as well as Disclaimeral. I had felt that presence of when I had worked on United Nations endeavors and this time it was more laid back and less intense compared to last times on January 6th, 2021.<br><br>Themes: #GoodDay #Productive #Mornings #Needed #Time<br>#Intimacy #Life #IWonAlotOfTheLegal #Truth #Fact <br>#Whirlwind #Dimensional #Test #PresenceBeKnown #PrimeTime<br>#OldFamily #Moral #Good #True #HitHome #Spiritualists #Specials #Casuals #ColdAirMornings #WhatDoPoliceGet #WhatTheyNeed<br>#Sports #Societal #Peace #War #ForThoseDon&#39;tWantToBeBad <br>#WhatHasBeenDoneDimensionallyToSpaceSituated #Tacklings<br>#NotOnly #ThereAreSomeTopsAround #BannersSupposedly #Virturious<br>#UnitedNations #UnitedDimensions #UnitedSpiritual #Non-Corrupted</div>
