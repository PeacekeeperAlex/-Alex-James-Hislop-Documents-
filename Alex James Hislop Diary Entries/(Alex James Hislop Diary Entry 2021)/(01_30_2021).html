<div class="title">(01/30/2021)</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Who was the corporate champion for true and good on this planet? I felt it to be a good question lead to start with on this Diary Entry given some of the misunderstandings regarding the interplay of Work and Spirituality on this planet. We had spoken of Work Gods previous and there had been insinuation as well as styles of play having to do with a suppression of Earth-Based Spirituality in which interestingly enough we have seen the enlightened get air time from the Spiritualist on this planet and wouldn&#39;t it be the point that somehow we spiritualists on this planet had forgotten a couple gods in the mix but also not really by way of spirituality itself in the look of those Gods of Work earth-based branch. They exist and what remedied the thought of less air time was the average joe. For the Gods of Work and Recreation as well as life were upon them prominently. Didn&#39;t the average remind of work in a certain sense as well as recreation. I felt the overhead happened to be life but I felt that it should be more emphasized and understood. There was people that reminded of life but when you looked towards different people on this planet especially the average joe North American, there was a look of Work Gods. Not certain spiritual pretending to be for what the joe considered to be their own work gods but the real McCoy. Where I would note a lack of that enlightened, caring and compassionate style of spirituality spoken of prominently by spiritualists on this planet upon the joe, I would note a regular working impressional and for those that know more a recreational impressional that was a part of that good spirituality. Perception was a big one and when asked about spirituality there was a perception upon me that thought psychic and classic impressionals upon was thought of when asked about spirituality in the sense of discernment of the spirit. <br><br>Psychic was another interesting one in which noted neutrality had been understood but again was more of the good spirituality that earth-based was truly from and didn&#39;t always have the impressional thought of by classic spiritualists on this planet that truly depicted what we are from in history. There was cleaned upon impressional regarding many different trades that was noted in dimensional and impressional, like light impressions upon carpenters, more advanced medical and healing upon doctors and medics as well as soul healing remedy upon nurses. It wouldn&#39;t surprise to note more advanced auto-technological on mechanics but probably was deemed as a blatant if not masked as the classic wrench and grease. It was something I discerned as a psychic medium and was correlated by reaction and response of the spirit around me at times. Even impressional of assent in the assessment of such a energies around people of employment. Why wouldn&#39;t be it that it was not only those of employment but also other kinds like homeless and charitable. I noted that there was a great home impressional upon the homeless person that was envied at times by the regular person employed. Why wouldn&#39;t safeguard such peoples. Charitable had even more resources then the employed and wouldn&#39;t it be these people that should receive as such for the kind of work they do. It was this refencing in regards to work that some were trying to relay that didn&#39;t always have to do with have to do with employment. It also had to do with ways of life, like duty, honor and charity that sometimes included living life. Just because someone wasn&#39;t working physically didn&#39;t mean they weren&#39;t working but it also sometimes didn&#39;t have to with what has been associated with job employment. Another one that needed remedy was understanding that working didn&#39;t always have to do with hard work. It made me wonder about the fact of what I had experienced and discerned in regards to understanding some of the interplay of work and what that meant for recreation. <br><br>What kinds of Recreationalists were there on this Planet? It had made me think of the different kinds of recreation activities for true in the definement of workers at times based upon work and employment. I had pondered what the kind of spiritual endeavors being done through recreation as well as what the spiritual counterpart was regarding. The Rock climber reminded me of colours on the wall and grey on the mountain. Technical and safety impressional upon them at times in emphasis. Maybe there was a light impressional upon them for a reason upon new heights gained in karmic. The gamer had a large amount of impressional upon him speaking exactly as to the recreational and sometime pro as to what he did. It was a blatant over the head for sometimes physicals on this planet did not know the spiritual overlaps not only upon oneself but also in regards to the game itself. Yoga speaks of healing stance in the movements through meditational movements. Serenity is some of the impressional I discern and an emphasis of new age spirituality. To think that there is spirituality in overlap that depicts spirit pursuing endeavors of recreational around physical pursuing recreational and is part of those energies is amazing. Literal impressional of sporting being spirit in sport upon those pursuing sports is fascinating. Imagine greatest sporting moments and you wonder at amazement as to what kind of spirituality is taking place. There are those in sports that would say that the note a sense of energies not only during those great moments but during regular sport as well but also that those great moments carry something, sometimes I have noted a specific colour regarding, a white aura glowing transcendence. White Gold energies did remind of hockey moments great but it wasn&#39;t the only energy colour impressional. It&#39;s throughout every day life too and maybe in understanding a weak point that is a need be healing in those that were not living life to fullest kind of mentality was a good thing, where energy emphasis of feeling better be placed.  <br><br>In life preparation for certain lives from the second age for what I was labelling it to be, there was a look as to what it was supposed to be and not just hoped to be. Imagine a psychictivity normality called a sense in which the sense abnormality might have been labelled a psychictivity for how sense and psychictivity sometimes correlate and being able to sense and discern family more prominently at will. A commute ride home while speaking spiritually naturally to your family in the spirit considered a normality. It might have been at one point in time in prep for certain life, that working wasn&#39;t necessarily as emphasized and given that discernment would be less relevant for the world in harmony and unity. It would be more align as to what some envisioned not only in the second but also in the spirit currently for kind of normality still understood not just to be a civility especially in understanding proxy information and what one is choosing let alone the respecting of such. I had looked at a certain sight and it told me that work manifested and family survived. For if the interaction was suppose to be more family based and even recreational vacation kind of look, that events did take place in which wasn&#39;t the excuse to have to go to work for saving especially at times in our face kind of nature but more of the maintenance lines for what makes given certain events that happened. That kind of work made sense but when it had to do with something that made less sense given the normality in regards to being safe and experiencing quality of life as well as that safety is a part of a quality of life immediate, it lost a bit of muster especially for the kind of abnormality that it would be during the second for let alone there being a moment of need be intervention as there was no such thing as spiritual attack at least not from then present but also in the look of if it would be a need to enlist in some sort of militia for the Original Creator would just show up and win. He wouldn&#39;t let anything bad happen. That&#39;s why the asking point as to why some these days need to join some sort of militia or coalition, let alone professional standing army is a coherent question. Realism speaks. For the Original Creator of the First for safeguarded prime perspective from exists today. He still wields most power to be true. <br><br>Having a set interaction created for the purpose of other selves for when they interact. For example, a physical in front of the scenes is going to watch a basketball game, a spiritual self regarding and even more immediate self in the light create a day in which is set for the purpose of when that physical watched the NBA game.
