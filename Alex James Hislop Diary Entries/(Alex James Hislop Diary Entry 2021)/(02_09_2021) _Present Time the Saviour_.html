<div class="title">(02/09/2021) &quot;Present Time the Saviour&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Since when did I work on this process in the past. What was understood and what was told. What needed to happen but also could it be more than it seemed. A person exists. He learns about the spirit. He finds secrets to life but also a dark line. He learns even beforehand a mechanic to life in karmic learning that morality promotion does create power through moral actions naturally strengthening self in the original setting. Literal anatomical that gets stronger and shows that strength with visual tell as well as other sense tells. The miraculous that the natural original setting state interaction truly is with true natural was seen. He learns that there is spiritual conflict taking place. He creates advocational and shares his experiences, writes books about it and learned about his process. The experiences he had witnessed and eye holes of what it was that was safely experienced in understanding what this process was regarding had prepared. There was psychic discernment of some of the conflicts that he had sensed and it formed into something in which a perception built and contrasted with reality. It was understood to be safe in sensing reality in listed ways that true good guidance relayed. Transcendence of knowing if direction should include provision of abnormal miracles was emphasized. He learns that programs exist to fully raise vibration safely and quickly for lower plane spiritual on the drop of a dime across the board. It changed life. The Tortuga that true good and good referenced was mobilized.  He knew that this was case of self defense. He his anatomical shaped as such. The patterns were more than there and less than the suppression of misunderstanding. <br><br>I had also asked if I truly was the young in regards to live actions in the past. I didn&#39;t feel I was the only one who maneuvered and I couldn&#39;t imagine having to sense the future impact upon natural original setting state anatomical regarding real natural anatomical of life. Even saying in that matter in reference to true natural anatomical and it does correspond with the original setting. It was said for what was happening and what had happened as well that I might be allowed to show the continued truth to the past of what I chose present time for always. Spiritually the known truth had been that the True Good remaining in present time could win outright, saving most if not all safely and instantly as well as easily forever. The bad realizing that they could experience just as decent experiences facilitated by the true good was one of the answers and the best part is that they didn&#39;t have to be harmed either as well as the other kinds guidance listed. The difference was a negligible if there was experiences garnered upon them that they didn&#39;t want to experience. When you compare the difference in regards to facilitation prowess from the true good and the bad, the difference was negligible especially when understanding personal boundaries. Interaction was one of the answers. Safeguarding experiences across the board and facilitating what one wanted to experience. The ending line of the conversation.  It was molding and shaping in the correct ways. They said if you won the famous line, then you won the game and the famous line happened to be most if not all choosing that most if not all be saved safely and instantly as well as easily and while some thought logically as well as, be true for a truth no shit, but it was the truly famous in All choosing to save All safely and instantly as well as easily that be the true famous alongside but not for the reasons that some surmised as it used to be. I had asked if there was a true good line that would totally walk away the other kinds compared to true good given classification understanding. There happened to be a simulation I had seen for metaphorical truth that did justice. It spoke that true good spectre status exists. Who was the chosen one in the mix. <br><br>Why did present time need to figure it out? Aligned the true present time existed. I had remembered earlier five days ago give or take something was brought up that told of days previous in a certain manner but it really extends to the past. What did present time need from other time frames to be able to win. Everything present time needed was given to present time in a gambit worth watching. In doing so present time was able to provide to past and future. I didn&#39;t always have to do some sort of game to kickstart something. <br><br>Safe for what one experiences especially economically regarding actions and non-actions. Where are the Guardians supposed to be defending me especially upon reference that I do defend myself. <br><br>The end of the day went a bit strange with academia impressional as well as societal type in certain manner. I realized groups work together up to a point and I had wondered if it was still what some thought maybe based upon what others had experienced. I didn&#39;t know where physicals on this earth stood fully and it made it interesting up to a point but also scary. I knew there was a line whether it be well defined but maybe more seen to be transcended  these days in what it should have been as well as the importance of everyday life as could be seen in how i felt to be both a seemingly ignored variable and coveted billboard famous for the earth-based spiritualist and what they brought to the table. I knew that there was something similar with other ways of life on this planet too. There was a natural to anatomical in regards to being a physical but also furthermore being a physical human on this planet. I took the spiritualist information on this planet as a guiding point compass for what it truly was and what it could be as well as should be up to a point. I didn&#39;t want to accept something that I couldn&#39;t accept. A lot of the natural was supposed to be safe and was supposedly safe, even that in which veered away from what earth-based spiritualists espoused and the naturalist could point towards that in which if there wasn&#39;t an influencing variable in regards to physical to promote immorality that it would be more within the vision of what was intended for some. For me I struggled with that because I was a psychic and I cared about the spirit. I felt psychictivity especially that in which facilitated with contact upon home dimensional to be what I was hoping for, true home dimensional. <br><br>There was an argument of gaming in what some were doing in regards to certain aspects of gaming on this planet physically. What was chosen by the physicals and the spiritual aspects happened to be fairly well in line. I didn&#39;t know what it meant for if POWs were fashioned to put fourth something in which was not in line with that kind of line of thinking but I knew it might have been a part of the problem. 911 operator shouldn&#39;t have had to been like I was on duty as a police officer in whatever map I played and Assassin&#39;s Creed shouldn&#39;t have had to be the piece of eden that saved man. The themes I had seen earlier in Far Cry, Far Cry 3 and even Far Cry Blood Dragon were really a part of the discussion. What did the Physical Earth-Based Human Gamers on this planet relay for what was chosen for this paragraph? Imagine in the light there happened to be a large communication regarding explaining experiences and suggestions. What was the reality in regards to some of the suggestions and how they could work. I felt the path of spirituality for told true by physicals on this planet held one of the answers. <br><br>There was a separating factor in which the ways of life facilitation especially gaming held one of the keys. It was only a partial answer but it seemed to be the partial answer that held salt to be mended. I felt yesterday that a continued maneuvering of movement was in the direction of moving certain kinds of life utilizers away and providing lifeworks as well as emphasizing their own lives regarding was taking place and it certainly should have been taking place for the kind of simplistic let know of direction that made sense. Specifically given the prowess that the good had in facilitating ways of life. A certain variable that would try and use physical in front of the scenes in ways of saving themselves and their own wasn&#39;t the only answer that could be provided. <br><br>Whatever the hell happened to me in which alienated was an unfairness worth not abiding for.
