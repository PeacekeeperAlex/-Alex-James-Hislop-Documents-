<div class="title">(01/06/2021) &quot;I can only go so far...&quot;</div>
<div class="content">Activity:<br>Still having trouble sleeping. I have been awake in the early morning hours for a bit now, where  I would rather be sleeping, I have had the difficulty of knowing that here is spiritual manipulation in regards to sleeping and awakening. <br><br>There was movement of other dimensional infrastructure after utilizing light entrances and going towards even as far as Halls within as well as going towards exits as well and leaving certain areas. I had known about the fact that is spiritual in regards to certain wordings. There is multiple I feel for what&#39;s acceptable, like i have been able to identify specific spiritual within the wordings themselves. I don&#39;t know if certain spiritual life signatures are a part of what I am sensing in regards to the word but I feel it might be a possibility. Entrances remind of guardians. There is also impressional in regards to words themselves as well in which at times I feel at times is different or at least classified different to be able to identify the word and what it represents to a certain degree too. I have been able to go towards words with sight and sense. Like going towards the word entrances bringing up spiritual entrances. My actions and non-actions are only what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Natural Original Setting State in which my Main Spirit Guides in the Light as well as in other places have relayed the truth regarding this especially for some of safety information and energy. For example, when I go towards the wording exits with sight and sense, it&#39;s only the exits that my Main Spirit Guides indicated that are suppose to emerge where my Main Spirit Guides indicated and the safety information that safeguards Physical Earth as well as other kinds in regarding my Actions and Non-Actions. Write the word Entrance on a peace of paper and Imagine visualizing white light in the direction of that writing. There is an impressional in regards to the word entrance. If look at the sign entrances at hospitals and other kinds of facilities you will note a certain common impressional. <br><br><br>Stances and how I knew there was spiritual through stances in which reflected regarding physical ease of movement as well as unease. The feeling of ones wrist sometimes bringing bad memories of chains and even rubbing ones neck as well too with a tell of certain chains removed regarding either actions, seeming more fluid in a tell that there was people and spiritual released and rescued through me in which might be a tell that is happening on this planet too. <br><br>I have noted certain spiritual culture along my psychic journey. There is a one having to do with colourful hair that I have discerned to be good. They remind of a certain Punk culture, a bit different than the Ri culture although potentially a part of such culture. At times there has been connotations of Space in a certain manner. There is a certain distinct in regards to them and I thought them to be good and there was a distinct to another I had labelled Saergera in which I thought related to this culture in a certain manner or at least a part of it in a certain sense on a potentially given my psychic interaction and how at times there had been mix ups in regards to who is who regarding cultural and aesthetic. I had noted that punk culture could was often times was colourful with black and I had wondered what the colour of white had to do with it. <br><br>I was hoping for something and I wanted to say something, it had to do with approachment and transportation. That that was a key to winning hearts and minds. Maybe some of the experiences I had within the past couple years changed a certain variable, had something to do with going out the house as strange and poetic as that was considering I was a home body. It didn&#39;t mean I wasn&#39;t outside my home at times, but I was one of those people that liked to stay in. Maybe that extended to spiritually as well in a certain manner. I was still that but I realized that waking up on the wrong side of the bed didn&#39;t have to mean something it didn&#39;t.  I was scared at times in this life. Psychic attack should have dulled me and emphasized me more shy for what it might have truly been for a part of myself but at times it lit fires in which some couldn&#39;t but try to start. I had looked at it from perspective of how the most powerful good might have deserved to have a fir lit under them for the stupidity of forgotten creeds most sacred. As a person approaching it from two fold younger and old as well as with creeds of the past, almost as if this heresy of walking away and even terrible existence was fresh, even while still adaptive and utilizing in front of the scenes play and an emphasis with personal and people trying to live their lives upon that societal normality variable that might have everything to do. I needed to relay that Space was a good place. I had known it to be true and that kind of spirituality that was told on this earth existed prominently in Space. Imagine a spiritual overlap that exists extending all throughout space and overlapping planets in which certain selves are a part of. Think of the light and that is one of them, but there was also other dimensional and Metaphysical in the natural of Space. I feel there might have been some of the Good dimensional that I knew to exist not to be considered by some at least to be a part of the natural but I knew for me that it some of it was considered to be a part of the natural and I knew I wasn&#39;t the only one with that considerment. Sometimes there was Light and Dark interplay that didn&#39;t have to do with bad or good. The inkiness of space might very well be an illumination of light and luminosity in overlap prominently but I also believe there to be many colourful dimensional regarding such an area. I wanted to ask considering the past what exactly that good spirituality of space happened to be? <br><br>Enlightenment exists and somehow a perception on earth-based of high science and neutrality regarding had coloured a lens that does speak in a certain manner of a certain kind of enlightenment. I think many of that ilk for the truth that it holds regarding certain spiritual and physical would respond in a certain manner of enjoyment, like and care does have something to do with the higher regard of science as well as neutrality and technology. It&#39;s not the only culture in regards to space for what I discern. At what point be able to relay Draconian but for my perception regarding holds them in a different regards than some of the Earth-Based perception supposedly. Instead of dark I saw past to what the spirituality might more be akin for many of them in the warrior and classic dragon. Maybe the old code was more at heart in the remembrance of brave and chivalry. Maybe it would be less on the inside if the outside reflected. I know there is a reality to situations but what I type might be more true than what some think for especially when I think of light culture and the brave. Guardians. Sometimes the loving and compassionate as well as societal clouth put fourth a perception too in which if it wasn&#39;t so sought after by my own culture would relay more of what light culture can be about at times. It&#39;s not just about humanity. What was the classic relayed by dragons in the Light? The answer I feel had been given. When we look towards some of the moments in our lives, we sometimes search for meaning not only because we want to be inspired but because of what we meant. That is inspiring for in the pursuit of happiness it can mean a lot to ones self as is seen in the it can mean everything. I had wondered what the Original Life had thought about some of the physical culture in which much of which does often times have spiritual components. I loved that there was names come up with on earth-based internet by humans as well as other kinds if spoken about spiritually that relayed what existed out there. It was most brilliant and amazing to see relayance of culture not only through truth of being a part of certain bubbles for some of us but also that there would be tells through content and art as well as mathematics. There thought to be fictional concepts that actually fact of existence right in front of our eyes in safe manners. I think love and family was more cherished than what some thought in regards to other alien cultures.
