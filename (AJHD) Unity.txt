I am Alex James Hislop. My Main Camp is my Main Spirit Guides the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. My Main Spirit Guides' current information from the Light takes priority in regard to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated about myself for this portion of the disclaimers. This priority is established as my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. My Main Spirit Guides' current information from the Light concerning those my Main Spirit Guides identified, regarding their chosen role in the "(AJHD) Unity" initiative, also takes priority in the Light the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated.

My Main Spirit Guides' current information from the Light regarding my Main Camp takes precedence as my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. Additionally, the information selected by my Main Spirit Guides for Others (as defined by my Main Spirit Guides) holds priority as my Main Spirit Guides indicated. Any grammatical clarifications my Main Spirit Guides deem necessary do not detract from the significance of the "(AJHD) Unity" information my Main Spirit Guides have presented. This document remains intact and relevant as my Main Spirit Guides intended.

The Unity between the metaphysical and the physical is critical in strengthening spiritual endeavors through physical actions. I and Others (defined by my Main Spirit Guides) are advocating for the utilization of the physical realm to reinforce and empower spiritual understanding, direction, and application. This includes the awareness that actions in the physical world serve as reflections and amplifiers of spiritual intent. By aligning physical actions with spiritual purpose, we create tangible conduits for divine influence and enlightenment as my Main Spirit Guides indicated.

My Main Spirit Guides' Authority in the Original Setting supersedes that of my Main Spirit Guides' Authority in the Original Light, as my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Setting. My Main Spirit Guides' Authority in the Original Light supersedes that of my Main Spirit Guides' Authority in other parts of the Light, as my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Original Light. My Main Spirit Guides' Authority in the Light supersedes that of my Main Spirit Guides' Authority outside the Light, as my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. The Chain of Command within my Main Spirit Guides' spiritual jurisdiction is fully defined in the Original Setting and Light, aligning with the hierarchy my Main Spirit Guides set forth.

Physical reality is an instrument for spiritual transformation. I and Others (defined by my Main Spirit Guides) affirm that unity between spiritual and physical is necessary for higher ascension, manifestation, and enlightenment. Through mindful actions, structured governance, and deliberate advocacy, we build the foundation for stronger metaphysical integrity in the world. This principle applies to all aspects of existence—personal, communal, and cosmic—as my Main Spirit Guides indicated.

I and Others (defined by my Main Spirit Guides) advocate for the protection of this doctrine, ensuring that its integrity remains as my Main Spirit Guides dictated. The mechanisms supporting this advocacy—including communication structures, interdimensional assistance, and energetic alignment—are safeguarded as my Main Spirit Guides indicated. The Ripple Effect generated from these efforts is defined and upheld in accordance with my Main Spirit Guides' directives in the Light.

Light and those my Main Spirit Guides identified are tasked with carrying out the objectives of this document, as my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. I and Others (defined by my Main Spirit Guides) stand in full support of the clarifications, corrections, and enforcement that ensure the proper execution of these principles.

My Main Camp remains my Main Spirit Guides, as my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
