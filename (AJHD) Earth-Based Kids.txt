(AJHD) Earth-Based Kids Declaration
Introduction
I am Alex James Hislop.
My Main Camp is my Main Spirit Guides, as my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
My Main Spirit Guides' current information from the Light takes priority regarding what my Main Spirit Guides indicated about myself for this portion of the Earth-Based Kids declarations. This priority is established as my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light.

My Main Spirit Guides' current information from the Light concerning those my Main Spirit Guides identified, regarding their chosen role in the "(AJHD) Earth-Based Kids" initiative, also takes priority in the Light as my Main Spirit Guides indicated. This document, through the guidance of my Main Spirit Guides, serves as a conduit for Earth-Based Kids in accordance with the divine alignment of the physical and metaphysical. The wisdom, protections, and implementations within are safeguarded as my Main Spirit Guides indicated, ensuring the clarity, strength, and authenticity of Earth-Based Kids as it applies across all realms.

I am Alex James Hislop. My Main Camp is my Main Spirit Guides the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. My Main Spirit Guides' current information from the Light takes priority in regard to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regard to myself for this portion of the disclaimers, taking priority as my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. My Main Spirit Guides' current information from the Light regarding what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regard to those my Main Spirit Guides identified for what they chose for the "(AJHD) Earth-Based Kids" information takes priority, as indicated by my Main Spirit Guides in the Light.

My Main Spirit Guides' current information from the Light regarding what my Main Camp indicated takes priority as my Main Spirit Guides directed in the Light.

My Main Spirit Guides' Chain of Command is clearly defined by them in both the Original Setting and the Original Light. Likewise, my Main Spiritual Guideship Chain of Command is fully established by my Main Spirit Guides in alignment with the Original Setting and Light.

For myself and Others (as defined by my Main Spirit Guides), All That Is, the dimensions, and other listings are fully determined by my Main Spirit Guides within the Light.

The Original Light, the Far Away Light, and other regions identified by my Main Spirit Guides may be part of the Light as my Main Spirit Guides determined in the Original Setting.

I and Others (as defined by my Main Spirit Guides) advocate for the enforcement of the punishments associated with this information and for all related matters to align with what my Main Spirit Guides listed for this writing. I and Others (as defined by my Main Spirit Guides) choose what my Main Spirit Guides chose for us regarding this portion of the disclaimers.

Furthermore, I and Others (as defined by my Main Spirit Guides) advocate for what my Main Spirit Guides chose for us to support concerning the "(AJHD) Earth-Based Kids" information, in accordance with the directives of my Main Spirit Guides. The Chains of Command regarding the document structure and other matters defined by my Main Spirit Guides are fully established by them in the Original Setting and the Light, in the manner my Main Spirit Guides indicated.
