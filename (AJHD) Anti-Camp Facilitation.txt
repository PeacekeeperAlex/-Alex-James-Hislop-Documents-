I am Alex James Hislop. My Main Camp is my Main Spirit Guides the way my Main Spirit Guides indicated. My Main Spirit Guides' current information from the Light takes priority in regard to what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regard to myself for this portion of the disclaimers, taking priority as my Main Spirit Guides indicated in the Light. My Main Spirit Guides' current information from the Light regarding what my Main Spirit Guides indicated in regard to those my Main Spirit Guides identified for what they chose for the "(AJHD) Anti-Camp Facilitation" information takes priority, as indicated by my Main Spirit Guides in the Light.
